Emmys Fashion: Red Reigns on the Carpet (Again)

TV's leading ladies continue to rule the carpet in red. On Monday night, a bevy of boldfacers stepped out for the Emmys in various shades of scarlet.

Christina Hendricks stunned in a strapless Marchesa gown with gold embellishments, while her Mad Men co-star January Jones dazzled in a printed Prabal Gurung gown. Project Runway host Heidi Klum, who arrived with Zac Posen, covered up in a draping gown by her designer date. Adding a bit of sparkle to her otherwise plain look, Klum added Lorraine Schwartz jewels for a bit of shine.

Octavia Spencer stepped out in a Tadashi Shoji gown with a metallic red clutch to match, and Minnie Driver wore a Marchesa gown complete with a bejeweled neckline.

Julia Dreyfus-Louis didn't disappoint when she arrived in a belted Carolina Herrera gown with her perfectly side-swept 'do. In typical fashion, Guilana Rancic played it safe in a simple, structured gown designed by Gustavo Cadile.

Last, but certainly, not least, Claire Danes arrived in a belted lace dress by Givenchy. And if that wasn't enough, the Homeland actress accentuated her bold look with extra rosy lips.

I think it's safe to say: On Mondays, they wear red.
