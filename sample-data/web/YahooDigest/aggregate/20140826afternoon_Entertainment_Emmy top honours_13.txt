But, why? Well, it turns out he's just too hot. Sophia told us, "I didn't bring him. I told him you can¡¯t come. You¡¯re too hot, too sexy. He's too tall, he makes me look short." Fair enough, Sophia. Mystery solved.

So there's no SoJoe at the Emmy's, but can we still call them that? According to Sofia, "It's OK, it¡¯s been such a fun thing to see what the people say and write on the internet and the social media, it's really crazy."
