Emmys: Watch Seth Meyers and Billy Eichner Harass Strangers in 'Billy on the Street' Segment

Billy Eichner teamed up with Emmy host Seth Meyers for a special edition of his popular Billy on the Street segment, which they debuted during Monday's telecast.

In his signature frenetic style, Eicher &mdash who is currently appearing on Parks and Recreation &mdash and Meyers polled random New Yorkers for the well-received comedy bit. Based on his "For a Dollar" game, Eicher gives $1 for anyone who agrees with his statements or answers questions correctly.

Some of the funniest moments came when Eichner referenced Yahoo Screen saving cult comedy Community for another season after NBC had canceled the series: "Yahoo just picked up Community and Hotmail picked up 12 episodes of Judging Amy!" Another highlight came when a woman failed to recognize the Emmy statuette.

Another memorable moment came when Eichner asked random strangers on the street about Orphan Black star Tatiana Maslany's snub. "Who cares?" said the guy. Plus, Eichner had to drop in an Orange Is the New Black question. "Miss you're a lesbian, are you watching Orange Is the New Black?" "I do, but I'm not a lesbian."
