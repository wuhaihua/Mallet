Amazon Traders Don¡¯t Flinch on Rumor of $1B Twitch Buy

Traders didn¡¯t know what to make of reports that Amazon had agreed to buy game-streaming service Twitch for more than $1 billion.
News of the said-to-be agreed upon deal, reported by The Information and the Wall Street Journal, only marginally impacted the stock with shares up less than a percent and off from its high of the day.
