Hamas claims 'open-ended' ceasefire has been agreed with Israel
An agreement has been reached between Israel and the Palestinian authorities over a ceasefire in Gaza, a Hamas spokesman has said. The official claimed that an "open-ended" ceasefire has been agreed to to end the seven weeklong war that has led to the deaths of more than 2,000 people. There was no Israeli comment.
The spokesman said that Israel had agreed to ease its blockade of Gaza to allow relief supplies and building materials into the territory. Overnight, several more people died and more than 20 were injured in multiple air strikes in Gaza, which followed rocket attacks on Israel.
