MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko said all leaders taking part in talks in Minsk on Tuesday agreed on the need for de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine.
"We all wanted a breakthrough," Lukashenko told journalists after talks that brought together Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko.
"But the very fact of holding the meeting today is already a success, undoubtedly," he said. "The talks were difficult. The sides' positions differ, sometimes fundamentally... Everybody agreed on the need to de-escalate and free hostages."
