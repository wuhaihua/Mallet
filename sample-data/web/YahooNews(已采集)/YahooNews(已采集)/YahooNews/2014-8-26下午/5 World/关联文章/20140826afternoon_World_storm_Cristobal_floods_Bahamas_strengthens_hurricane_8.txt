Environment Canada says warm weather not over yet

The cooler weather in New Brunswick may have some thinking summer has wrapped up, but forecasters say the province is in for a warmer than usual fall.
The days are getting shorter and frost is always a possibility, but fall temperatures are still in the distance.
Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips says surface water temperatures will influence the climate and in Atlantic Canada they're up to two degrees warmer than normal.
¡°A lot of heat is left in the rivers and lakes and oceans so theres a feeling the air would come from the south. So there's a feeling the air would have a bit more warmth to it,¡± he explains. ¡°Now we're talking about September warmth not the dog days of summer.¡±
Phillips says weather models are also showing a less active tropical storm season.
