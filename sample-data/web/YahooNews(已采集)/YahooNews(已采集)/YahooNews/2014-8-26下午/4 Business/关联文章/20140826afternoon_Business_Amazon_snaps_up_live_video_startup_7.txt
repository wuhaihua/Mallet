Amazon to Acquire Live-Streaming Service Twitch for Nearly $1 Billion

Despite months of speculation that Google would acquire live-streaming service Twitch, it's Amazon that has finally sealed the deal. 

The Seattle-based tech giant has agreed to purchase Twitch for $970 million in cash. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year. 

"Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month &mdash from The International, to breaking the world record for Mario, to gaming conferences like E3. And, amazingly, Twitch is only three years old," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said. "Like Twitch, we obsess over customers and like to think differently, and we look forward to learning from them and helping them move even faster to build new services for the gaming community."

The deal was first reported by tech blog The Information.
