Frank Underwood down!

Kevin Spacey showed up to the Emmys red carpet on Monday night rocking a classic black tux, with a beautiful woman on his arm (journalist Ashleigh Banfield). In his other arm: a cane. Dapper? Of course -- but also functional.

The House of Cards star revealed to Entertainment Tonight's Nancy O'Dell that he was nursing a bit of an injury from the day before. Turns out, Spacey is willing to sacrifice himself for the perfect tennis shot.

"The cane wasn't actually planned," he said. "Two days ago on the tennis court, I strained my hamstring in racing for a drop shot -- which I got, by the way! It was the winning point, so at least there's that."

And really, that's all that matters.

Spacey is up for Best Actor in a Drama series on Monday night along with Matthew McConaughey, Jeff Daniels, Woody Harrelson, Jon Hamm and Bryan Cranston.

"It's a group of really fun actors who've done really great work," he said.
