Emmys Fashion: White Gowns Are a Thing

White -- it's not just for weddings anymore, right? And not just for summer, either. All year round and definitely an option for black tie, as seen on Monday's Emmys carpet. White is flattering, staggering in bright lights and totally commands attention. Black and dark shades make bodies recede - and white makes them pop, and shows off the skin tone. Laverne Cox donned a while jersey halter goddess gown by Mark Bouwer, with a train coming off a soft silky cape - and a very dramatic strap at the throat. Anna Chlumsky's white Zac Posen gown was more of a column shape and simple, with short sleeves and a tiny bit of train. Padma Lakshmi also donned a crystalline, white slinky gown by Ralph Rucci which perfectly accentuated her dark hair and golden skin. And Michelle Monaghan of True Detective also played the innocent in strong clear white Giambattista Valli number. Even Camilla Alve's sexy print knit gown was mostly in white. While Sofia Vergara donned a Roberto Cavalli in a hue white as snow.
