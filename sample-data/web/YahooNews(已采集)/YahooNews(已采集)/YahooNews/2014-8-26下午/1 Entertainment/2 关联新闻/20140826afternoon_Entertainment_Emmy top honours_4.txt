Laverne Cox is officially three for three in the fashion department this awards-show weekend. The Orange Is the New Black actress looked classically chic as she attended the 2014 Emmys (her first ever!) at the Nokia Theatre in L.A. on Monday, Aug. 25.

The star, like so many others in Hollywood, has been party-hopping all weekend. She wore a black sequined Marc Bouwer knee-length dress while presenting at the MTV Video Music Awards with costars Taylor Schilling and Uzo Aduba in Inglewood, Calif., on Aug. 24. One night earlier, she glammed up in a white Donna Karan number at Entertainment Weekly's Pre-Emmys party in L.A.

Cox makes history tonight as the first transgender person ever to be nominated for an Emmy award. She's nominated in the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series category for her role as Sophia Burset on the Netflix smash hit OITNB.
"I don't think anybody else in the world is happier than I am right now. I don't think it's possible for anyone to be happier," Cox told Time after hearing the good news from her agent and publicist last month. (She also became the first transgender person to cover Time magazine back in May.) "It doesn't seem real! I am nominated for an Emmy? What? Oh, my goodness."

To celebrate, Cox let loose at a Justin Timberlake concert and touched base with loved ones. "I've run around my apartment. I've jumped up and down. I screamed. I cried," she said. "I called my mother and my brother and I cried with them. And laughed."
