Julia Louis-Dreyfus has won her third-consecutive Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy? Get out!

The actress won the trophy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy at Monday's Emmy ceremony for her role as Selina Meyer in HBO's comedy Veep. 

She celebrated the win by locking lips with Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston on her way to the podium. "The show is very dense, as you might notice," she said in her acceptance speech before thanking her cast and crew for maintaining "grace under pressure."

Louis-Dreyfus prevailed over Lena Dunham (Girls), Edie Falco (Nurse Jackie), Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly), Amy Poehler (Parks & Recreation) and Taylor Schilling (Orange Is the New Black). 

This is Louis-Dreyfus' third-straight win in the category for Veep. She had also previously won the category for The New Adventures of Old Christine in 2006 and outstanding supporting actress for Seinfeld in 1996.
