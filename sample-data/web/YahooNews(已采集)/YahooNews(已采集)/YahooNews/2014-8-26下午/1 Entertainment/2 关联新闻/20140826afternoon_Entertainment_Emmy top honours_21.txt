Emmys Beauty: This is How Natasha Lyonne Got Her Waves

Orange is the New Black star Natasha Lyonne is usually seen with beautiful natural curls, so how did she achieve the effortless beachy waves she rocked with her custom Opening Ceremony frock at the Emmys on Monday? First off, she let her mane naturally air dry before celebrity hair stylist Seiji (who has also worked with Nicole Richie and Coco Rocha) took over.

¡°She had some ideas about her part, and we tried the center part first, then figured out the side part worked best. She¡¯s more comfortable with that, and natural texture,¡± Seiji told Pret-a-Reporter. After applying some dry shampoo at the roots of her dry hair, he spritzed in Redken¡¯s Rootful Root Lift Spray.

Seiji then alternated between using a flat iron and a curling iron to achieve the waves Lyonne ended up with. ¡°The natural texture really made sense to me with the dress,¡± Seiji said. ¡°Mixing the flat iron and curling iron makes it look more natural. You get different results by blow-drying first, but the naturally dried hair gives this natural texture&mdashit¡¯s not too done, and not crunchy.¡±

There's a sea of beachy waves at the Emmys this year. And we'll go ahead and say that Lyonne's look falls in the top of the heap.
