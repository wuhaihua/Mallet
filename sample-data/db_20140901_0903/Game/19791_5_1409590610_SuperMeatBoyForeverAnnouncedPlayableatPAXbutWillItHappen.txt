			Does anyone else feel like Team Meat has had mobile gamers on the longest episode of Punk&#8217;d ever? Over the last few years they&#8217;ve announced a few mobile games that have never ever ever come to pass: Super Meat Boy: The Game, Mew-Genics and, most recently, A Voyeur For September.At PAX Prime this past weekend they showed off what&#8217;s become of Super Meat Boy: The Game. It&#8217;s now an auto-runner called Super Meat Boy Forever (which is an anagram for A Voyeur For September, explaining that game away too).Announced for smartphones, tablets and Steam, Team Meat are describing Super Meat Boy Forever as a &#8220;full length platformer for touch devices&#8221; that they&#8217;ve designed &#8220;from the ground up to avoid tacking bad controls on an existing design.&#8221;Being an autorunner rather than an endless runner, you might think that the levels would be lovingly hand-crafted (rather than generated on-the-fly). But while they&#8217;re promising a full story and 6 chapters, Team Meat&#8217;s Edmund McMillen also says the game &#8220;will feature a vast randomly generated level structure that ensures a totally new play experience with each death.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean these won&#8217;t be hand-crafted sections that are randomly strung together, but it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s a certainty either.Super Meat Boy&#8217;s brilliant level design is really what made it so damned spectacular. Here&#8217;s to hoping that whatever &#8220;vast randomly generated level structure&#8221; means, it doesn&#8217;t take away from what we loved about the game in the first place.McMillen has also detailed some of the production details which&#8230; kind of leave me scratching my head. In early 2012 they announced Super Meat Boy: The Game for iOS. In early 2013 they were putting development on hold to finish their other mobile game, Mew-Genics. And now, according to McMillen, they&#8217;re putting Mew-Genics on hold to make Super Meat Boy Forever, which, also according to McMillen, is only two months into development.Can we all just take a moment to remember that the only actual iOS releases from either member of Team Meat were the intentionally terrible Tiger handheld version of Super Meat Boy and Zits and Giggles, a $400 game that was meant to serve as a commentary on how bullshit they believed the App Store to be?I believe that there&#8217;s a PAX, I believe Team Meat was at it, and I believe people played Super Meat Boy Forever there. I just don&#8217;t know what I believe beyond these three facts.There&#8217;s a vague 2015 release date, but if we&#8217;re being punk&#8217;d (as I still believe in my heart of hearts we are), expect it never.
