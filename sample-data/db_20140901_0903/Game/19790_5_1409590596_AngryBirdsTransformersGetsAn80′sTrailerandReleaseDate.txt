			If you&#8217;re a twenty- or- thirty-something that spent the formative Saturday mornings of your childhood watching cartoons while shoveling Mr T cereal into your mouth, Rovio has something you&#8217;ll surely appreciate. The latest trailer for Angry Birds Transformers looks and sounds like something off a VHS tape, bad tracking and muffled sound included. The only giveaway it&#8217;s not from the &#8217;80s is the lack of recycled animation.The events in Angry Birds Transformers revolve around the &#8220;EggSpark,&#8221; a mysterious force / object that crash-lands on Piggy Island and transforms everything in its path &#8211; eggs included. The Autobirds and Deceptihogs need to put their past hostilities aside and bring the eggbots under control. Expect shenanigans.Angry Birds Transformers has a released date of October 15th for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.
