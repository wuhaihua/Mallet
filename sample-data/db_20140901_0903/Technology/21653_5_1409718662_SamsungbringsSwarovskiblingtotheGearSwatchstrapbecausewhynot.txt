Samsung brings Swarovski bling to the Gear S watch strap because why not? Samsung brings Swarovski bling to the Gear S watch strap because why not? Samsung&#8217;s love affair with bling continues with the recently announced Gear S. The Gear S in itself isn&#8217;t affected, it&#8217;s the strap. The strap will be made completely with Crystal Fine Mesh, which is being introduced this month. Samsung feels these Swarovski cut crystals &#8220;perfectly complement the chic, curved design of the Gear S.&#8221;I think it makes the most sense for the &#8220;Swarovski for Samsung&#8221; collection to include the Gear S since watches are more of a fashion statement than smartphones. No word on price, but I wouldn&#8217;t expect it to be cheap though. If you find it&#8217;s your thing, you will be able to find the new strap at the Samsung online store and at experience stores starting in October.source: Samsung Tomorrow
