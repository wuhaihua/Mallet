Where are the two-door models in Volvo’s lineup? With the sporty C30 hatchback and luxurious C70 convertible now both gone from the lineup, it’s a question that anyone familiar with the brand is bound to ask, come trade-in time.
But as Peter Mertens, Volvo Cars’ R&amp;D chief, hinted this past week at a roundtable with members of the motoring press just after the reveal of the new 2016 Volvo XC90, a new generation of coupes and convertibles are still maybe five years out.
That might seem a bit surprising, considering that when Volvo decided to reveal its new design direction in a series of well-received concept cars this past year, a stunning Concept Coupe was the first shown.
Concept Coupe showcased the potential in Volvo’s renewal
In retrospect, it was quite a teaser. The automaker launched its series of concepts with that one, Mertens said, in order to show the bandwidth of its new scalable platform architecture (SPA) underpinnings -- and that the potential is there for some very nice coupe proportions.
“It’s possible to put this beautiful proportion and style, and dramatic design, on that architecture, on a coupe -- as well as on a super-proportion, beautifully styled, dramatic SUV,” said Mertens, who pointed out that they have flexibility in width, unlike some other automakers’ flexible platforms. “And that is a strength, and something that is unique.”
