Logitech is no stranger to Bluetooth keyboards, but with the newly announced K480 the accessory maker is looking to connect three different devices at the same time, regardless of the computing platform.



As the keyboard is platform agnostic, you can connect various devices running Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Android or iOS via Bluetooth at the same time. To switch between devices, all you have to do is toggle the Easy-Switch key to the desired device. There's also an integrated slot on the keyboard that can house a smartphone and a tablet.

Available in black and white, the K480 is set to launch later this month in the US and Europe for $50.
