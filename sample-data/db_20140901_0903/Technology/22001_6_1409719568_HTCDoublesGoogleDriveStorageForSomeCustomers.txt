HTC Doubles Google Drive Storage For Some Customers HTC Doubles Google Drive Storage For Some Customers If you’ve bought one of HTC’s newer phones, you might be pleased to learn that HTC has recently announced that they will be doubling the cloud storage that is provided to their customers who might have bought some of their devices. Prior to this, HTC and Google had teamed up to provide cloud storage as part of the “HTC Advantage” program.
Back then only 50GB was provided, which is actually a lot if you’re just using it to store photos and documents, but the good news is that the number has since doubled to 100GB. Unfortunately not all of HTC’s devices will receive the upgrade. Instead those who are eligible for the upgrade includes owners of the HTC One M8, HTC One Max, HTC One Remix, HTC Desire 816, and the HTC Desire 610.
This offer is not permanent, however. It will last you a good two years, after which if you wish to continue using that amount of storage you will have to start paying Google for it. However if you think that it is worth the money, then the free two-years would be a boon. In order to collect on the offer, all you’d have to do is launch the Google Drive app on your phone and redeem the offer when it pops up.
