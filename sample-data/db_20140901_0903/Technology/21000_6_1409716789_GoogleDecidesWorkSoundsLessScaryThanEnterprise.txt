Google Decides 'Work' Sounds Less Scary Than 'Enterprise' Google Decides 'Work' Sounds Less Scary Than 'Enterprise' 
Google likes rebranding stuff to make it sound less complex, so it&#8217;s not surprising that it has decided to retire its Google Enterprise name and replace it with Google for Work.

Google announced the change in a blog post: &#8220;The time has come for our name to catch up with our ambition. As of today, what was called Google Enterprise is now, simply, Google for Work.&#8221;
Visiting www.google.com/enterprise/ now produces a page branded &#8220;Google for Work&#8221; &#8212; though visiting www.google.com/work/ still redirects you to the &#8220;/enterprise&#8221; address. Fixing URLs can be a messy business, though Google has relocated its former Google Enterprise blog.
Google has form in this area, having previously changed the somewhat awkward &#8220;Google Apps For Your Domain&#8221; to &#8220;Google Apps For Business&#8221;.
