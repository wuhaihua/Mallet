This Year’s First Campus Hoaxer Put ‘White Only’ And ‘Colored’ Signs In Dorm To ‘Make A Point’ This Year’s First Campus Hoaxer Put ‘White Only’ And ‘Colored’ Signs In Dorm To ‘Make A Point’ College students are settling in back on campus this fall, and you know what that means: A fresh batch of leftist students perpetrating racist hoaxes on their fellow students.
This year&#8217;s first racist hoax occurred on the campus of Sweet Briar College on Thursday. A day after a school production of &#8220;In Sweet Remembrance,&#8221; , a student at the tiny women&#8217;s college in Lynchburg, Va. hung signs reading &#8220;Colored&#8221; and &#8220;White Only&#8221; above some water fountains and on some doors in a residence hall.
&#8220;Sometime between 8 and 10:30 this morning, four labels, made with a label-maker, were affixed to doors and the water cooler on the fourth floor of Meta Glass,&#8221; explained Sweet Briar&#8217;s interim president, James F. &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Jones, Jr. . &#8220;As difficult as this is to believe, two of the labels read &#8216;White Only,&#8217; and two &#8216;Colored.&#8217;&#8221;
Jones, who apparently hasn&#8217;t been paying attention to the high number of racist hate hoaxes on college campuses in recent years, worried that the Sweet Briar community might &#8220;have among us someone who is essentially bigoted and mean-spirited who would recall the Jim Crow days of separation, mirroring the apartheid of South Africa that summoned the calm voice of reason of Nelson Mandela to decry hatred.&#8221;
Sweet Briar&#8217;s student government president denounced the signs as &#8220;dehumanizing,&#8221; .
The student who hung the signs later turned herself in, claiming that &#8212; wait for it &#8212; she isn&#8217;t a racist. Instead, she said, she hung the hateful signs to &#8220;make a point&#8221; and advocate for social justice.
In a confession to Jones, which the school president posted online , the student attempted to explain her rationale.
&#8220;While posting these extremely hurtful labels, I had one thing in mind,&#8221; the confused student wrote. &#8220;My mission was to show others that words can still have an extreme impact, and the past still resonates with us all. While moving forward, we can never really shake the past. The past is a part of us and we are a part of the past. While they did not necessarily know this before, we are all equal and nobody deserves to be treated unfairly. I was trying to make a point, but the point ended up &#8216;making me&#8217; &#8230; now everyone has ideas on what type of person that I am. I am none of these things. &#8230; I am myself, I am caring and kind. I am the last person who would ever intentionally hurt someone else, but most of all, I am sorry!&#8221;

For some bizarre reason, Sweet Briar&#8217;s administration hasn&#8217;t identified the student.
Also, Jones was oddly sympathetic. He described the racist signs as &#8220;theoretically positive.&#8221;
