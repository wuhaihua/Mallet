BERLIN — It’s a big day for Samsung. The Korean manufacturer is readying to launch its much-hyped Galaxy Note 4 smartphone, along with plenty of other gadgets, on Wednesday at the IFA 2014 tech conference in Berlin. The Mashable team will be bringing you all the updates you need to know in real time.
Samsung hopes to take on larger-sized smartphones — even the rumored (and bigger) 5.5-inch iPhone expected to launch next week — in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season.
