Plus, you can uninstall the apps very quickly from WAM&#8217;s list function.The app will also give you an overview of different app&#8217;s permissions, separate applications from watch faces, check how much storage space you have left, and share apps with your contacts. It&#8217;s some pretty useful stuff that you would think would have been included in Android Wear from the start.The app costs a buck, which is well worth it for the extra functionality.
