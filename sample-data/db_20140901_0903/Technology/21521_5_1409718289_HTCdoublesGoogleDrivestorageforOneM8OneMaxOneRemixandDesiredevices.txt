HTC doubles Google Drive storage for One M8, One Max, One Remix, and Desire devices HTC doubles Google Drive storage for One M8, One Max, One Remix, and Desire devices 

HTC is giving a boost to some of its newest devices with a promotion for new owners to get double the Google Drive storage capacity. Now, instead of the usual 50 GB cloud storage space, new One M8, One Remix, One Max, Desire 610, and Desire 816 owners can get 100 GB of storage for free for two years.



To redeem the storage offer, all you need to do is launch the Google Drive app that's preloaded on your HTC phone and click redeem.

Does this offer make HTC's devices more attractive compared to rival manufacturers?
