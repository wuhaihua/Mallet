Samsung Galaxy Note liveblog! Live at 9 a.m. EDT, 3 p.m. CEST Samsung Galaxy Note liveblog! Live at 9 a.m. EDT, 3 p.m. CEST   

We're live from Samsung Unpacked on two continents today — the main event is at the IFA conference in Berlin, where you'll find Alex Dobie running the show, and Phil and Andrew are at a satellite event in New York City.

Samsung's not exactly been shy about, erm, noting that we're likely to see some new Galaxy Note fare. But exactly what we'll see remains a mystery — for a little while longer, anyway.

The event kicks off at 9 a.m. EDT — that's 3 p.m. in Germany. And we're liveblogging it RIGHT HERE. Stay with us.
