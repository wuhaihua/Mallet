IFA 2014 is almost upon us, and some pre-IFA news has come about today. The ASUS ZenWatch will be officially unveiled at IFA, but it seems that the CEO of ASUS decided to let us know that he is wanting the ZenWatch to have an under $200 price tag. Could sway some consumers out there, and it is much better than glamorizing the watch like Samsung is doing with the Galaxy Gear S. Very ugly and very stupid. Enjoy the Daily.
