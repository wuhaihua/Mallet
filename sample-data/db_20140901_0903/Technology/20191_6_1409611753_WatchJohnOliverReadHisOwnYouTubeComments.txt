Watch John Oliver Read His Own YouTube Comments Watch John Oliver Read His Own YouTube Comments Never read the comments. That&#8217;s one of the first and most important rules on the internet. Unfortunately, nobody told that to host of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver.
HBO&#8217;s new satirical news (satirinews?) show Last Week Tonight, hosted by the man himself, took a brief hiatus this week. And because it&#8217;s one of the best shows in the world when it comes to releasing content for those of us on the internet, Oliver made a brief web special where he decided to take the plunge and read the comments. 
Mistake.
Turns out that people of all languages and education levels think he&#8217;s a bit of a douche.
