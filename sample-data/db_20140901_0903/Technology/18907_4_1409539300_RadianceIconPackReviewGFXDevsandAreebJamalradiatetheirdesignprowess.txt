Radiance Icon Pack Review: GFXDevs and Areeb Jamal radiate their design prowess Radiance Icon Pack Review: GFXDevs and Areeb Jamal radiate their design prowess There&#8217;s always more room on your device for a new icon pack. Today, we take a look at a new icon pack, the Radiance Icon Pack from GFXDevs. That name probably sounds familiar as they&#8217;ve published quite a few icon packs, however this one was designed by one Areeb Jamal. As you can see, the icon pack features round icons with a solid circle in the centre with a translucent ring around it giving it a &#8216;radiating&#8217; appearance. Check out our video review of the icon pack to get a better idea of what it looks like in person:
As you can see, a very nice, unique set of icons. The Radiance Icon Pack currently has 600+ icons in there will the promise of more updates. The wallpaper count is a bit low at the moment (though the ones that are there suit the colour scheme perfectly) so hopefully there will be more wallpapers added in the near future. For updates on the icon pack and as well as future projects, be sure to circleÂ Areeb Jamal on Google+ here.
