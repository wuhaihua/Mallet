Potential iCloud Hack Sees Compromising Celebrity Photos Leaked Potential iCloud Hack Sees Compromising Celebrity Photos Leaked Whether you follow celebrity gossip or tech news, it seems that both genres have collided paths today in what can only be seen as one of the largest leaks of celebrity nude photos. According to multiple reports, it seems that a hacker has been steadily building up a collection of photos of a variety of celebrities and if you’re wondering what’s this got to do with tech, well it seems that they have managed to access these photos by hacking into Apple’s iCloud storage service.
Apple has yet to comment on the allegations that they have been hacked, but according to the reports, it seems that for the most part they were taken from iCloud, or so they claim. For those who are a little fuzzy about Apple’s iCloud services, it’s basically where users can upload and sync data on their phone with the cloud storage service. Not only can it sync your contacts, your calendars, your messages, your notes, but it can also backup your photos.
The hacker did not disclose how they managed to obtain the photos or how they hacked iCloud. According to actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead who was a victim of the hack, she claims that the photos that were leaked were taken a very long time ago and had long been deleted, suggesting that the photos stolen were from a backup service, such as iCloud or somewhere else.
It is also unclear as to how widespread the hack is. Was the hacker only targeting celebrities or were they targeting all Apple users who might have compromising photos or sensitive information in their iCloud storage? We guess we’ll just have to wait and see how this develops.
