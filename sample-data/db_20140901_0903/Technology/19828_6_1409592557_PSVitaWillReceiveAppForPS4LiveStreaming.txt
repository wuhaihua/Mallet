PS Vita Will Receive App For PS4 Live Streaming PS Vita Will Receive App For PS4 Live Streaming 
There&#8217;s a lot of difference in the sheer power between the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita however Sony has found ways to make both consoles work with each other at some level. Soon PS Vita owners will be able to use their handheld console to view live stream of games from the PlayStation 4. This was announced by Sony at the Tokyo Game Show.

The app is called &#8220;Live from PlayStation&#8221; and will make its way over to the PlayStation Vita in a future software update. As previously mentioned, Vita owners will be able to view live streams from a PlayStation 4 on their handheld console.
Not only can streams from a local PlayStation 4 can be viewed, the Live from PlayStation app will also allow Vita owners to view gameplay streams from other PS4 consoles that are streaming gameplay. Think of it like a service that&#8217;s similar to Twitch, but is only available on the PlayStation platform.
Another announcement that Sony made regarding the PS Vita is that it will also receive the ability to customize the homescreen with software update 3.3.0. Users will be able to use different themes and characters from various games to customize the homescreen. Reports suggest that the app and this software update are destined to be rolled out this October.
