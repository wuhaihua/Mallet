The Moto X+1 Gets a Leaked Close Look The Moto X+1 Gets a Leaked Close Look  The Moto X+1 should be announced later this week, but TK Tech News got a sort of exclusive look at the new phone, and talked about it in a new video. I myself also made a video about what was shown in the exclusive, and a must say, the successor of the Moto X is looking fancy. The two images of the Moto X+1 one TK got, were of the front, showing off some lovely wallpaper, and of the butt, showing us a Moto button and the camera sensor. It is stated that this phone will have a power button located on the back that is the Moto logo, which was originally thought to show up in the first phone. The camera will no doubt be heavy duty, and the phone itself will be lined with aluminum. Moto Aware seems to be present in the phone, and this is going by the Moto app that appears on the homescreen. Front-facing speakers are also shown off, which will please a lot of us and I think they should be standard in all devices in the future. Check out the video below to hear what was found in this new leak. Give us your thought bout the new Moto X+1, and let us know if you plan on purchasing it.
