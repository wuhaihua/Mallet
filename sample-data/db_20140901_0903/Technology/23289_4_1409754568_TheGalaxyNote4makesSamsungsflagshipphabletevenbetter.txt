The Galaxy Note 4 makes Samsung’s flagship phablet even better The Galaxy Note 4 makes Samsung’s flagship phablet even better Image: Killian Bell/Cult of AndroidAt its Unpacked event in Berlin today, Samsung announced its much-anticipated Galaxy Note 4, which makes its flagship phablet family even greater. It&#8217;s packing a 4.7-inch Quad HD display, a 16-megapixel camera, and 3GB of RAM — and it&#8217;s the first Galaxy Note device with a metal chassis.The Note 4 is exactly what the many rumors promised it would be — a super-sized smartphone with the best specifications available right now, coupled with an all-new design. And in comparison with last year&#8217;s Note 3 — which is still a very good smartphone — it&#8217;s even better in almost every way.As expected, the Note 4 has a 5.7-inch display, which is the same size as its predecessors. It&#8217;s significantly sharper, however, with a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 — and significantly faster, thanks to its new quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor. That&#8217;s combined with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, plus a microSD card slot for expansion.The Note 4 also boasts a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization that promises better photos in low-light — plus a 3.7-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,220mAh battery.Image: Killian Bell/Cult of AndroidPerhaps the Note 4&#8242;s biggest improvement, however, isn&#8217;t under the hood, but the hood itself. Like the recently-released Galaxy Alpha, the Note 4 continues Samsung&#8217;s mission to improve the design and build quality of its mobile devices with a new metal chassis that sports iPhone-like chamfered edges.The plastic remains around the back, however, where you&#8217;ll find a rear panel with a faux leather finish much like the Note 3&#8242;s.Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t be a Samsung device without some special software features, too. The Note 4 comes with the Galaxy S5&#8242;s Ultra Power Saving Mode, plus a Rapid Charge feature that claims to charge your battery halfway in just 30 minutes. Samsung has also improved its camera app to make it even faster, and added new features for the S Pen.Image: Killian Bell/Cult of AndroidThe Note 4 will go on sale this fall, and details on pricing will be available nearer the time.
