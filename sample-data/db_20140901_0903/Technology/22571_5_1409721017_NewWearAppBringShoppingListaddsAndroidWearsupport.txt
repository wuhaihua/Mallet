[New Wear App] Bring! Shopping List adds Android Wear support [New Wear App] Bring! Shopping List adds Android Wear support There are a slew of apps for managing your grocery lists, but Bring! Shopping List turned it up a notch with the introduction of Android Wear support. In fact, the developer is touting this as the first grocery list app to do it.Bring! was introduced late last year and it&#8217;s one of the lesser known options. However it includes most of the same features that made the others so popular such as syncing between family members, sharing, and push notifications. What separates Bring! Shopping List from others is that it&#8217;s image driven rather than just a list of text. They offer over 350 hand drawn images for various grocery items and they appear in red when you need to buy them.Now that Android Wear support is added, you will be able to check off your items without taking your phone out of your pocket. Hopefully more grocery apps take notice. If you&#8217;re sporting an Android Wear smartwatch, you might want to give it a try. Screenshots and download links below.Features
