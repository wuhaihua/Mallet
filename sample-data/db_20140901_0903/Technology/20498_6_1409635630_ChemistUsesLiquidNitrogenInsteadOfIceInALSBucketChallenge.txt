Chemist Uses Liquid Nitrogen Instead Of Ice In ALS Bucket Challenge Chemist Uses Liquid Nitrogen Instead Of Ice In ALS Bucket Challenge 
Moe Qureshi &#8212; a chemist at the University of Toronto &#8212; gave his ALS bucket challenge a shocking twist when he decided to use liquid nitrogen instead of ice. I would be terrified just by the thought of pouring liquid over my head at -321&deg;F (-196&ordm;C), but Moe survived the challenge unscathed &#8212; thanks to science.
