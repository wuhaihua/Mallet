AT&T Offering $100 Credit For Adding New Line On Next AT&T Offering $100 Credit For Adding New Line On Next 
AT&amp;T has announced that it is offering $100 bill credit to all subscribers who add a new line on AT&amp;T Next program. This offer is extended to all existing and new subscribers of the carrier. The phone has to be purchased through AT&amp;T&#8217;s equipment installment plan, which it calls Next, and only then do customers receive the $100 bill credit.

The AT&amp;T Next program was announced after T-Mobile forced every carrier&#8217;s hand last year by coming out with its own equipment installment plan. Under this program customers can get new smartphones with no money down, no upgrade and activation fees as well as no annual service contract.
Customers are offered two plans with varying installment periods. AT&amp;T Next 12 and AT&amp;T Next 18 binds subscribers to make monthly installments for the phone they&#8217;ve purchased for 20 months and 24 months respectively.
This is a limited time offer, $100 bill credit will only be offered on the activation of a new line on Next with a new smartphone until September 30th. Subscribers have to &#8220;remain in good standing&#8221; to receive the credit within three bills. With this promotion AT&amp;T has thrown a lifeline to those who have been waiting to add a new line or have been willing to jump from another carrier. While the $100 credit won&#8217;t offset early termination fees from the other carrier, it may help offset the additional charges like sales tax and such.
