Hearthstone’s Next Expansion Will Feature 100+ New Cards Hearthstone’s Next Expansion Will Feature 100+ New Cards It wasn’t too long ago that Blizzard announced and released the Curse of Naxxramas expansion for their Hearthstone card game. The expansion was largely a single-player experience where players would not have to compete against other players in order to complete the expansion and access the new cards.
All of that is expected to change in the next expansion, which according to the folks at Joystiq is already being worked on. With the next expansion, Blizzard is expected to introduce over 100 new cards to the game, which is more than triple that of the Curse of Naxxramas which introduced about 30 new cards.
The new cards will also be delivered in a new type of card pack, although details on that remain scarce for now. Currently players who wish to obtain new cards can get them by either farming for gold to buy card packs, or purchase them using real life money, so it will be interesting to see what this new type of card pack will entail.
Unfortunately there is no word on when the next expansion will be released, but Blizzard expects that with the new cards and the way it is delivered that it will have a much bigger impact on the game. We guess we’ll just have to wait and find out! In the meantime does the idea of 100+ new cards sound good to you?
