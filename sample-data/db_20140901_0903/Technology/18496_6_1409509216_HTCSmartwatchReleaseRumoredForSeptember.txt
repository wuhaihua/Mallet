HTC Smartwatch Release Rumored For September HTC Smartwatch Release Rumored For September 
If reports and rumors are to be believed then September is going to be a very good month for gadget lovers. Not only do we have IFA 2014 in the first week, where countless manufacturers like Sony and Samsung are going to unveil new flagships, but in the second week we have Apple with its new iPhones and possibly its wearable as well. A latest rumor suggests that HTC may be looking to take a piece out of this pie as well by launching its own wearable device in the month of September.

The rumor comes from a Twitter account that goes by @upleaks, some claim that it has taken up the baton that was passed on by infamous Twitter leaker @evleaks.Â According to the rumor HTC is working on a smartwatch that is destined for shelves next month.
There&#8217;s no information as yet on the design, specifications or features. The account only claims that it will be called HTC CWZ and that it will be released in September in North America, Brazil, Japan and other markets.
Truth be told we have been looking towards HTC to come up with a wearable device ever since the company&#8217;s Chairwoman Cher Wang said back in February that HTC will have a smartwatch ready to ship around the holiday season. This rumor seems to line up with that timeline but it remains to be see exactly how much consumer interest it manages to receive once it finally hits the market.
