Nokia Lumia 830 Could Sport 10MP PureView Camera [Rumor] Nokia Lumia 830 Could Sport 10MP PureView Camera [Rumor] If there’s one thing to get excited about the upcoming Nokia Lumia 830 are the rumors that despite it being a mid-range handset, it is expected to sport a PureView camera attached to the back of it. What this means is that users who want a good camera won’t have to shell out a lot of money for a high-end device.
Now previous rumors have suggested that the Lumia 830 could pack a 20MP rear-facing camera, however those rumors have since been contradicted by a post by WPDang (via Windows Phone Central) who claims that the Lumia 830 might only pack a 10MP camera on the back instead.
Now as we have said before, megapixels don’t necessarily account for image quality, unless you are planning on having them printed out on huge banners or unless you’re planning on doing some major cropping. That being said we’ve also seen perfectly fine examples from other smartphone OEMs who have kept the megapixel count low, but yet manage to produce impressive images anyway.
In any case it is expected that Microsoft will take the wraps off the Lumia 830 at IFA 2014 where they will announce it alongside the Lumia 730/735, so do check back with us this Thursday for the details.
