Involve Everyone During Group Job Interviews Involve Everyone During Group Job Interviews 
Sometimes, you&#8217;ll find that job interviews consist of multiple members of the company asking you questions. Even if one interviewer does most of the talking, consider asking the quieter interviewer to speak up.

Over at the Harvard Business Review, there&#8217;s a reminder of the importance of managing the interview:

Think of yourself as the facilitator of the group. If one person can&#8217;t stop talking, it&#8217;s up to you to turn her off politely. If there is an interviewer who hasn&#8217;t had much to say, make a point of letting him into the conversation. Go around the room, if necessary, to make sure everyone has had a chance to be heard. They are likely looking for someone who will listen to everyone carefully and provide the structure for them all to move forward together, and this is your chance to show them you can do it.

The interviewers that don&#8217;t speak up may have already made up their mind. Talking with them brings any objections they have into the open so you can discuss any problems.
