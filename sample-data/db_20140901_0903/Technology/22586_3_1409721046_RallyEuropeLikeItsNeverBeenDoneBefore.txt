Rally Europe Like It’s Never Been Done Before Rally Europe Like It’s Never Been Done Before 
Love to drive? Love to party? Want to see lots of Europe in just 7 days? The Death Trap Rally is your motoring Trifecta then.
The rally bills itself as &#8220;3000 miles. 8 Countries. 1 Week.&#8221; As organizers say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be under the impression this week will be easy, we expect hard driving and harder partying in unequal measure. DTR &#8217;15 is for people ready to take it to the next level, when everyone else has gone home!&#8221;


It kicks off June 6, 2015, in Luxemborg with a reception followed by live music at a local night spot. Then the driving kicks off with a trip to Europe&#8217;s motoring mecca: Nürburgring.
As if that&#8217;s not an adrenaline rush, that night you check into a hotel in Berlin. Where you can base jump. From your hotel.
Then your trip takes you to Kaunas, Lithuania: the rally&#8217;s halfway point. You&#8217;re promised a night that separates the men from the boys. No mention what happens if your rally team has females.


From Lithuania it&#8217;s off for a short drive (by Death Trap rally standards) to Riga, the capital of Latvia. Continuing the death trap theme (i.e. driving Nürburgring, hotel base jumping), you can fire off guns at a driving range. Then it&#8217;s an overnight cruise to Stockholm – with no sleeping allowed.
From Stockholm you motor to Oslo, Norway, for a rock concert. The next day, ears probably still ringing, you head to Copnhagen and a four-star hotel that looks like something out of Star Wars.
And where else could a Death Trap Rally end then Amsterdam? Dinner, awards, and another concert. After that you&#8217;re free to sample whatever Europe&#8217;s Sin City has to offer.


The beautiful part of Death Trap Rally? It&#8217;s all for charity. Fry your brain cells and help your fellow man. Organizers say 10% of the profits go to support ABF – the Soldier&#8217;s Charity. It&#8217;s a British organization for veterans.
Cost for the Death Trap Rally starts at $1666 for quad occupancy. Clear your calendar for June 6 to June 13, 2015, and pack a spare liver.
