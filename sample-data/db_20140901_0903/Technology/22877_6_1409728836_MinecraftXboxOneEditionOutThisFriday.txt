Minecraft: Xbox One Edition Out This Friday Minecraft: Xbox One Edition Out This Friday It was yesterday that we brought you word on how there were updates concerning the possible console ports of Minecraft, and here we are with official word that Minecraft: Xbox One Edition will be made available later this coming Friday. Yup do mark down September 5th on your calendars so that you can look forward to a download of it over in the Xbox Store later in the week. I guess this means the weekend will be a little bit busier than normal, or you would have to procrastinate the different kinds of chores that you had lined up earlier on.
Those who are running on Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition will be able to perform an upgrade for just $4.99 a pop, while those who are new to the Minecraft bandwagon will be able to go ahead with a full game download for $19.99 a pop.
Apart from that, existing Xbox 360 Minecraft players will be able to enjoy all of the downloadable content that they have purchased for the Xbox 360 Edition for free when you re-download it for the Xbox One. Not only that, one is also able to transfer their favorite Xbox 360 worlds as well as content to the Xbox One Edition, which means your creations will be stashed there for good and nothing is lost during the migration.
