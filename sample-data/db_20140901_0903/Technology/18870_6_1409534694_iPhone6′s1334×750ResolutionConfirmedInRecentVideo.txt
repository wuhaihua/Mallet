iPhone 6′s 1334×750 Resolution “Confirmed” In Recent Video iPhone 6′s 1334×750 Resolution “Confirmed” In Recent Video We can only hope and assume that with the iPhone 6, Apple will not only be bumping the screen size of the phone, but its resolution as well. After all what’s the point of having a large display but have low-resolution, right? Well previously we have heard some theories on the potential resolution of the iPhone 6 and those theories could have recently been proven.
According to the theory, it was speculated that the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 could sport a resolution of 1334&#215;750, as suggested by John Gruber who used a bit of math wizardry to arrive at that number. Now thanks to a recent tweet by developer Steve Troughton-Smith, he has basically confirmed the resolution based on recently leaked videos of the iPhone 6.
The folks at Feld &amp; Volk have recently released a video of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 that has been powered on. However as you can see in the image above, the shows the “Connect to iTunes” image seems to have been letter-boxed. MacRumors then took it upon themselves to investigate the matter and after taking into account the letter-boxing, they too have surmised that it is possible that iPhone 6 could sport a resolution of 1334&#215;750.
That’s great news for would-be owners of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, although many are still waiting for the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 which is rumored to sport an even higher display of 2208&#215;1242, although weirdly enough it seems that there are more 4.7-inch leaks compared to 5.5-inch leaks, which would serve to corroborate the claims that there could be production issues.
In any case take it with a grain of salt for now but Apple is expected to make an announcement on the 9th of September, so be sure to check back with us then for the details!
