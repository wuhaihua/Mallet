Samsung Has A Curved Soundbar For Your Curved TV Samsung Has A Curved Soundbar For Your Curved TV 
That horizontal sound bar next to your crazy expensive, totally-not-gimmicky curved screen TV is such an eyesore. If only it were, you know, curved. Like your TV. Samsung clearly thinks this is a problem that&#8217;s begging to be solved, because the company has just announced&#8230; a curved soundbar.

The sleek, aluminium-clad device is designed to match perfectly with the company&#8217;s 55 and 65-inch curved TV sets. Samsung says that you can either install it under your TV where the curves will be flush with each other, or mount it on a wall where you might just be able to pass it off as a piece of installation art. It also promises some decent 8.1-channel surround sound support on the soundbar and will throw in some side speakers for immersive audio.
The device will be unveiled this week at IFA 2014 in Berlin. No word on price or availability yet, but we&#8217;re guessing it won&#8217;t be cheap. [Samsung via Engadget]
