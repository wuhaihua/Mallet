Google Is Ready To Launch The Budget Android Counter-Punch To Apple Google Is Ready To Launch The Budget Android Counter-Punch To Apple Debuting&nbsp;earlier this year at the Google I/O Developer Conference, Google’s low-cost Android&nbsp;platform, Android One, is expected&nbsp;to be announced&nbsp;for the Indian market on&nbsp;September 15th (reports NDTV&nbsp;and&nbsp;others). 
The&nbsp;reference design described in the I/O Keynote&nbsp;featured a 4.5 inch screen, FM Radio, dual-SIM support, and microSD expansion. Google would also offer ongoing support to handsets using&nbsp;the design including software updates, and over-the-air OS updates. Wrap all this up in a design which (so the thinking goes) can be sold for $100 SIM free, and you have a very attractive budget handset.
	
								 
With the large subsidies offered in the West allowing consumers to ‘buy’ their new iPhone or Galaxy S5 for $99, the Android One platform will be targeted at the BRIC countries first, where there is less of a subsidy culture, but still a demand for&nbsp;high-quality smartphone experiences. 
 
It is unlikely that the Android One handsets will have high levels of app engagement and revenue generation for third-party developers around the world because of the&nbsp;different economic profile of the owners. Networks will want as low a subsidy as possible so the monthly plans can generate more profit.&nbsp;Extracting as much value from the initial handset sale is a vital part of the&nbsp;manufacturers business plan. 
With Google taking on board much of the design process, and working with suppliers to provide a steady stream of common parts, this will reduce the bill of materials and initial cost to handset manufacturers using the Android One platform. 
 
By creating a hardware fork of Android suitable for low-cost handsets, Google is fostering&nbsp;relationships with the low-cost manufacturers where rapid turnover is&nbsp;more important than large margins.&nbsp;Google’s ultimate goal here is to capture users into their own ecosystem, where they hope they become lifelong users of&nbsp;Google’s services, using Google&nbsp;stores to purchase media, and being exposed to Google’ advertising.
										
										 
The team at Mountain View do not need to turn a profit on the licensing for these&nbsp;handsets, they just need to capture as many users into Google’s Android world as possible, with as low an acquisition cost as possible.&nbsp;The profit for Google comes with that volume of users.
