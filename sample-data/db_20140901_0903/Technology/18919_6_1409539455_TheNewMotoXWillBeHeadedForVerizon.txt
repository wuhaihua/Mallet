The New Moto X Will Be Headed For Verizon The New Moto X Will Be Headed For Verizon A couple of weeks ago, Motorola sent out invites to an event that they would be hosting on the 4th of September. While we guess the event could be for just about anything, many have speculated that the announcement could be for the new Moto X and possibly the new Moto G as well.
While it remains to be seen if that is the case, the folks at Phandroid have recently obtained a screenshot of what appears to be Verizon’s internal system which lists the Moto X. Now the new Moto X has gone by the Moto X+1 moniker, but according to Verizon’s system, it is simply referred to as the new Moto X.
We’re not sure if that will be the official name or if it’s just a placeholder for now, but we guess we’ll find out more on the 4th of September. That being said, its listing in Verizon’s system has also revealed that it will be part of the carrier’s lineup and that it will come in 16 and 32GB options.
The listing also mentions Moto Maker which we guess is expected since customizability was one of the phone’s key selling points. It is unclear if Verizon will be having an exclusive with the phone but hopefully more will be revealed this coming week, so check back with us on the 4th of September to learn more.
