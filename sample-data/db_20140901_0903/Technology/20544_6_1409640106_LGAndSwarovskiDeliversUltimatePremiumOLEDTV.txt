LG And Swarovski Delivers Ultimate Premium OLED TV LG And Swarovski Delivers Ultimate Premium OLED TV When it comes to living in large, there are many different ways to do so. Some of us happen to have a whole lot more money than others to “throw around”, if you will, and even the high end stuff that one purchases ends up looking rather “ordinary”. Surely there must be more than what is available in the market to satiate your appetite? Apparently so, as South Korean consumer electronics giant LG has worked with Swarovski to roll out what they term to be the ultimate premium OLED TV.
Swarovski, the world famous Austrian jewelry brand as well as world-leading manufacturer of high-quality crystals, will partner with LG to deliver a truly exclusive Curved OLED TV at IFA Berlin that kicks off early this month. It boasts of a streamlined stand studded with shimmering crystals that will be complemented by the brilliant, precise colors of the OLED’s self-lighting pixels, making this truly an advanced TV that exudes elegance beyond compare.
Not only that, we are talking about a depth of just 4mm, in addition to the entire shebang tipping the scales at an extremely moderate 16kg, making this Curved OLED TV to be the perfect showcase for Swarovski’s finest crystals. Carrying LG’s stylish Crystal Stand, the ergonomically curved display does look to the observer as though it floats on thin air, and will be a breathtaking effect which will help increase viewer immersion. No idea on how much this will cost, but it will definitely come at a premium, no two ways about it. [Press Release]
