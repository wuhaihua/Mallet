								An Indian woman researcher is among the 16 scientists who has been awarded the prestigious Australian Laureate Fellowship for her work in micro-recycling of e-waste. 
&nbsp;
Veena Sahajwalla, director of University of New South Wales (UNSW) Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology, was recently awarded AUD 2.37 million for her research. Sahajwalla was also awarded &#8216;Georgina Sweet Fellowship&#8217;, under which she would undertake an ambassadorial role to promote women in research in addition to their research project. 
&nbsp;
Announcing these fellowships recently, Education minister Christopher Pyne said the fellowships were an important investment in the nation&#8217;s future. &#8220;This funding scheme supports researchers of international repute and these fellowships will play an important role in meeting the Australian government&#8217;s commitment to ensure Australia successfully competes on the international research stage,&#8221; Pyne said. &#8220;The outcomes of these Fellowships will make a valuable contribution to Australia\&#8217;s knowledge base and prosperity. Fellows will also mentor our young researchers, which is vital if we are to continue to produce world-class research.&#8221; Sahajwalla, who hails from Mumbai, said she was excited about her research which was basically to give a technological solution for recycling e-waste.
&nbsp;
 &#8220;I am really excited about my research which could have a global impact and implications,&#8221; Sahajwalla said adding, e-waste that were effectively getting thrown away had several high value metals like copper. Such e-waste, for example, contains copper and recycling it makes very good economic and environmental sense, she said. 
&nbsp;
&#8220;For example in India, such a research would be beneficial not only in terms of countering environmental challenges but also create new economic opportunities for underprivileged,&#8221; she said. The Australian Laureate Fellowships scheme is given by the federal government annually to over 16 researchers for their excellence in research.
