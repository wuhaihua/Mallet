When you are haggling for your salary, it might be best to put your ego aside and think about others whose lives your money will impact. In other words, think you&#8217;re bargaining on behalf of your family.

It is often repeated that you should be assertive in negotiations, but a study by Columbia Business School found that may not be the best way, especially for women. Negotiations went better when the women thought they were doing it on behalf of someone else, like their family who depends on them or their team.

The researchers comment that when negotiating her salary, a woman might frame it as bargaining on behalf of her family. When negotiating budgets at work, a female manager might frame her actions as bargaining on behalf of her division or team.

The Daily Muse cites an example where someone who had never negotiated a salary before found it easier to ask for a substantial raise when she considered the impact on her life with her partner.
