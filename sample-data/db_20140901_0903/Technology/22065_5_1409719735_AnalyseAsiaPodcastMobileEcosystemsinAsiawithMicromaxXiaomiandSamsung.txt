Analyse Asia Podcast: Mobile Ecosystems in Asia with Micromax, Xiaomi and Samsung Analyse Asia Podcast: Mobile Ecosystems in Asia with Micromax, Xiaomi and Samsung 

I was a guest on the first episode of&nbsp;Bernard Leong's&nbsp;Analyse Asia&nbsp;podcast.&nbsp;Our discussion focused on the following topics:


Mobile operating systems in Asia with Apple iOS and Google Android leading the way, and the implications for platforms with small market shares: Blackberry, Windows Phone and Firefox OS
A deep dive into two dominant Asian players: Xiaomi &amp; Micromax
What are core competencies and competitive advantages do they rely on to erode Samsung&#8217;s market share in the low-end and mid-range segments in Asia?
Samsung&#8217;s defense against these players and what does that mean for other OEM players?


We also touched upon Uber's potential and the impact self-driving cars could have.
