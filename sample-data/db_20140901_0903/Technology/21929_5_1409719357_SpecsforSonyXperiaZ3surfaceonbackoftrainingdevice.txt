Specs for Sony Xperia Z3 surface on back of training device Specs for Sony Xperia Z3 surface on back of training device A picture of a Sony Xperia Z3 from a training event appears to have revealed the specs for the device. The Xperia Z3 that was being used for training purposes had a sheet with specs affixed to the back of it. Although the image could be a fake, the specs seem to line up with previously leaked information. Assuming the image is real, there are a couple bits of new information we learn from the pic.First, we see that Sony is planning to make the Xperia Z3 available in a copper color. The addition of copper as a color choice will be a first for a Sony Xperia device and may help set it apart from the rest of the market a bit. We also see that Sony is including their Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE HX) in the device, which means it should produce near high-resolution quality sound.The alleged specifications also reveal Sony thinks users can get two days of battery life out of the 3100mAh battery included in the Xperia Z3 by using their Sony STAMINA Mode.Other specs for the Xperia Z3 include a 5.2-inch 1080p HD display, a 20MP Exmor RS camera capable of capturing 4K video, a Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB of RAM, and a micro SD slot.source: Xperia Blog
