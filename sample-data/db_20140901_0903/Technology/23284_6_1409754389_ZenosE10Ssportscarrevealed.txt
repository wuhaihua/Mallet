Zenos E10 S sportscar revealed Zenos E10 S sportscar revealed                        	


Zenos had revealed its lightweight track-focused model at the Autosport International event earlier this year. Founded by former Caterham boss Ansar Ali, the company has now revealed an updated variant dubbed the Zenos E10 S which will begin rolling out of the factory early 2015.Powered by a mid-mounted 2.0-litre Ford GDTI EcoBoost engine, the E10 S, packs more power than the standard E10. The standard E10 delivers 197PS of power from its naturally-aspirated 2.0-litre Ford GDI engine, while the E10 S produces 250PS of power.&nbsp;While the E10 does the 0-100kmph sprint in 4.5 seconds the E10 S does it in just four seconds with a top-speed of 217kmph. This feat is possible due to a carbon aluminum monocoque which manages to keep the curb weight down to a low 700kg.The &nbsp;Zenos E10 S gets 16-inch front and 17-inch rear OZ alloy wheels wrapped around in Avon tyres, with stopping power being provided by 285mm front and rear disc brakes. The double wishbone independent front/rear suspension with Bilstein dampers give it the much needed stability, while the removable front and rear wings keep the aerodynamics in check.The new Zenos E10 S will go on sale in Europe with a price tag of Rs 23.8 lakh. Zenos is also currently working on two new cars. The first will be the E11 Roadster, set to arrive in 2016 and the E12 Coupe, pinned to be launched in 2018.
