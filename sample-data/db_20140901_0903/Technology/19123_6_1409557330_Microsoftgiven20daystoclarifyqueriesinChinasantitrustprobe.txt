				Microsoft given 20 days to clarify queries in China's anti-trust probe
			
								A Chinese anti-trust regulator said it has given Microsoft 20 days to reply to queries on the compatability of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid a probe into the world’s largest software company.
&nbsp;
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) questioned Microsoft vice-president David Chen and gave the company a deadline to make an explanation, the agency said in a short statement on its website. SAIC also repeated that it suspected the company has not fully disclosed issues relating to the compatability of the software and the operating system.
&nbsp;
“Special investigation team conducted an anti-monopoly investigation inquiry with Microsoft vice-president Chen Shi (David Chen), and required that Microsoft make a written explanation within 20 days,” the SAIC said in a statement on its website. In a statement, Microsoft said it was “serious about complying with China’s laws and committed to addressing SAIC’s questions and concerns”.
&nbsp;
Microsoft is one of at least 30 foreign companies that have come under scrutiny by China’s anti-monopoly regulators, as the government seeks to enforce its six-year old antitrust law. Critics say the law is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, a charge the regulators deny.
&nbsp;
Last month, a delegation from chipmaker Qualcomm, led by company president Derek Aberle, met officials at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) as part of that regulator’s investigation of the San Diego-based firm. NDRC said earlier this year that the US chipmaker is suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards.
&nbsp;
Microsoft’s Satya Nadella is expected to make his first visit to China as chief executive later this month.
