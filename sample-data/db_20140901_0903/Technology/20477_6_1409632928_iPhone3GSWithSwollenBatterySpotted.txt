iPhone 3GS With Swollen Battery Spotted iPhone 3GS With Swollen Battery Spotted It looks like the number of incidents involving smartphone batteries exploding, or ballooning, is not exactly too rare in our society, especially when you take into consideration that there has been a fair number of reports in the past concerning such situations. While we have seen word on how an iPhone 3GSâ€™ battery ballooned to the verge of explosion earlier this year, here we are with another image sent by a reader to PhoneArena that his old iPhone 3GS had its battery blown up to unnatural proportions that the smartphone was broken.
Sorin Stroilescu noticed this and the first thought that came to his mind was to zero in on one of his daughters as the culprit, and after seating them down and throwing accusations their way, which they of course vehemently denied, Sorin decided to investigate the matter further and realized that the battery within the iPhone 3GS had somewhat mutated to a bloated version of its former self. 
This ballooning of the battery pushed the display out, and at least it was sitting on the shelf when that happened &#8211; otherwise imagine what might have happened if it suddenly occurred while he was using the handset, or if the phone had been sitting in his pants pocket. Do you have any more phone battery horror stories to share?
