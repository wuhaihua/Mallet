New Motorola Droid Phones Could Be Headed For Verizon New Motorola Droid Phones Could Be Headed For Verizon Motorola and Verizon have a special relationship in which Motorola would release devices exclusive to Verizon under the Droid branding. Now the DroidLanding Twitter account has been inactive for a while now, although a recent post has some speculating that we could be in for an announcement in the near future.
The most recent Motorola handset to grace Verizon would be the Motorola Luge, which is basically a rebranded Motorola Droid RAZR M so we guess technically it’s not exactly a new phone. There are rumors that the Moto X+1 could be making its way onto Verizon but unless Verizon rebrands the phone, there is a chance that this might not be the Droid we are looking for.
What this means is that there is a good chance that Motorola and Verizon could have new Droid handsets in the works that they have yet to announcement. Either way this all just speculation for now, but if you were a fan of Motorola’s Droid lineup on Verizon, then perhaps you’ll want to keep your eyes peeled for more info, or just check back with us at a later date for the details.
In the meantime is anyone else excited to see potentially new Motorola Droid phones make their way back onto Verizon’s network?
