Dell Releases UltraSharp U3415W Curved Ultra-Wide Monitor Dell Releases UltraSharp U3415W Curved Ultra-Wide Monitor Dell released its UltraSharp U3415W, a 34-inch curved ultra-wide monitor, which the company claims will provide an ergonomic multi-display workspace with just two displays; to rival those with three full-HD ones. The displays are equipped with blue-light reduction technology, to reduce eye-strain. The U3415W offers an aspect ratio of 21:9 (cinematic), with a native resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels, refresh rate of 60 Hz, and 8 ms response time (GTG). Display inputs include HDMI 2.0 (sufficient bandwidth to run the panel at its native specs), mini-DisplayPort 1.2, and MHL. The monitor takes both analog inputs, and digital audio passthrough from its HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.2 connections, to drive its inbuilt 9W stereo speakers. The UltraSharp U3415W from Dell will begin selling some time in November, 2014.
