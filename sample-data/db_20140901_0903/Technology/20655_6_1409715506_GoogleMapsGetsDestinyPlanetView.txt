Google Maps Gets Destiny Planet View Google Maps Gets Destiny Planet View 
Gamers around the world are anxiously waiting for September 9th, that&#8217;s when Bungie&#8217;s Destiny finally gets released. A lot of hype has already been created for this title, primarily because of the fact that it cost Activision some half a billion dollars.However Bungie isn&#8217;t going to stop promoting its new title. The developer has teamed up with Google Maps to present the Destiny Planet View. Its a fictional version of Google&#8217;s popular mapping service that&#8217;s set in Destiny&#8217;s fictional world.

If you simply can&#8217;t wait for Destiny to be released, like me, then you&#8217;ll really like Destiny Planet View. The website created for this purpose gives visitors a chance to browse around the three main locations that are featured in Destiny.
The Moon, Mars and Venus can be explored using a Google Maps interface that&#8217;s set in the future. This is something really unique that Bungie has done in collaboration with Google because a video game has never been &#8220;mapped&#8221; with the help of Mountain View.
Admittedly visitors will only be able to view a fraction of Destiny&#8217;s vast open worlds, something that Bungie prides itself on. Nevertheless it will be possible to visit different areas and explore gameplay tips, lore as well as hidden real-world and in-game incentives. The Destiny Planet View website can be accessed from here.
