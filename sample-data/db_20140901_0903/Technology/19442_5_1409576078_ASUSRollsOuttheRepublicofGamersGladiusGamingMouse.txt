ASUS Rolls Out the Republic of Gamers Gladius Gaming Mouse ASUS Rolls Out the Republic of Gamers Gladius Gaming Mouse ASUS rolled out its workhorse claw-grip gaming mouse to compete with market favorites such as Razer Deathadder 2013 and SteelSeries Rival; the Republic of Gamers (ROG) Gladius. Measuring 126 mm x 67 mm 45 mm (LxWxH), and featuring a fixed weight of 116 g, the ROG Gladius has a mostly-ambidextrous appearance, but is oriented for right-handed gamers.

Under the hood, is a 6,400 dpi sensor with 50 g acceleration, and 200 ips command rate. All buttons are Omron-made, with the main two buttons being rated for 20 million clicks. The scroll-wheel and middle-click buttons are reinforced. The mouse features an onboard EEPROM that lets you program resolution, acceleration, and macro-maps directly to the mouse, so you don't lose them to a broken SSD. Other neato features include user-replaceable Teflon feet, and two detachable 2 m long USB cables, one that's braided, and another that's slick, rubberized. The overall mouse body is rubberized, with matte elements. Those wanting a glowy logo are covered with a red ROG one.
