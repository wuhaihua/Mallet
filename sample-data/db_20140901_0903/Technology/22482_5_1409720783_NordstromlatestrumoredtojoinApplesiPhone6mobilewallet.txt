Nordstrom latest rumored to join Apple's iPhone 6 mobile wallet Nordstrom latest rumored to join Apple's iPhone 6 mobile wallet 

After reports speculating that American Express, Visa, and MasterCard may be joining Apple's September announcement in announcing a new mobile payments wallet for the iPhone 6, it is now said that Nordstrom may also be joining the camp. In addition to Nordstrom, a report suggests that Apple may also be in talks with other retailers for the initiative to allow customers to pay for physical goods at retail stores with their iPhone.



Talks with Nordstrom are said to "be in the early stages" so there is still a lot of uncertainty if Nordstrom will appear as a launch partner in time for Apple's September unveiling, which many believe will be used to unveil new iPhone and iPad models.

According to early speculations, Apple may utilize the rumored NFC hardware on the new smartphones, along with iTunes for payment processing, to allow customers to make purchases at physical stores. As such, Apple's mobile wallet would compete with Google Wallet on Android and ISIS, a mobile payments partnership between U.S. wireless carriers AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon.

The rumored partnership with Nordstrom may make sense given the retailer already uses Apple products in lieu of cash registers at many stores now.
