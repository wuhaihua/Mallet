You Won't Be Able To Find A Book In This Beautiful New Library You Won't Be Able To Find A Book In This Beautiful New Library 
Briefly You&#8217;re looking into Florida Polytechnic University&#8217;s new library. Light, bright, beautiful curves and&#8230; there&#8217;s not a single book on its shelves?

Nope, you read that right. The 11,000 square-foot, $US60 million, Santiago Calatrava-designed building doesn&#8217;t have a single paper book anywhere within it. Sure, it&#8217;s a beautiful space for working and reading &#8212; it&#8217;s just that everything is digital.
In fact, the library has a deal with with publishers that allows students to access titles once for free. If a second student chooses to read the book, the library automatically purchases the electronic book for its collection.
The reason it works so well for Florida Polytechnic University is that it&#8217;s a school focussed on science, technology, engineering, and maths degrees &#8212; and there&#8217;s a proliferation and acceptance of digital volumes in those fields. It&#8217;s harder to persruade harcore literary academics that it&#8217;s the right direction to move in. But from here, it certainly looks like the future. [Library Journal, Guardian via Verge]
