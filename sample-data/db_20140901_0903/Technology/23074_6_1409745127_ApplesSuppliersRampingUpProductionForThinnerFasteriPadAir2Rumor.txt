Apple’s Suppliers Ramping Up Production For Thinner, Faster iPad Air 2 [Rumor] Apple’s Suppliers Ramping Up Production For Thinner, Faster iPad Air 2 [Rumor] We guess it hardly comes as a surprise to learn that Apple could be planning on launching new iPads later this year. After all the Cupertino company has released new iPads on an annual basis like clockwork, so why should it be any different this year, right? That being said, it seems this year’s iPad Air 2 could be even thinner and faster than its predecessor.
According to a report from DigiTimes (via MacRumors), they claim that their sources have revealed to them that Apple’s supply chain partners have begun to ramp up production for some of the components that are expected to make its way into the iPad Air 2 later this year. They go on to claim that while the overall design and size of the iPad Air 2 will remain the same, it is expected to sport a thinner profile and a faster processor.
They also go on to state that Touch ID will be making an appearance on the tablet, which seems to be in line with earlier rumors. The report claims that Apple has asked touch panel suppliers TPK and GIS to manufacture full-lamination units for the device ahead of its launch this fall.
Now some of these claims are pretty obvious &#8211; after all why would Apple release an iPad with the same specs? While we did not expect Apple to make any design changes, we guess going thinner does seem to be in line with Apple’s MO, but either way take it with a grain of salt for now but check back with us at a later date for additional details.
