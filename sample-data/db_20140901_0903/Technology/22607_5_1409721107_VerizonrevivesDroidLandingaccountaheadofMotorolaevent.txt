Verizon revives Droid Landing account ahead of Motorola event Verizon revives Droid Landing account ahead of Motorola event 

It looks like Verizon Wireless has revived its Droid Landing Twitter account after having been inactive for some time now. The revival of the Droid Landing account on Twitter comes just ahead of Motorola's scheduled event for September 4th.



"Reactivation fast approaching, wait and see," the tweet reads.

Though nothing has been confirmed for the September 4th event, we may be able to see some new Droids to replace Verizon's aging Droid Ultra, Droid Maxx, and Droid Mini. The event is also anticipated to see the debut of Motorola's new X+1 flagship along with more information on the Moto 360's availability.

What are you looking forward to the most?
