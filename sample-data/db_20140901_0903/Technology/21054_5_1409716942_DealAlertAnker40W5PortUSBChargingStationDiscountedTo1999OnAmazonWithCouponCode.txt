[Deal Alert] Anker 40W 5-Port USB Charging Station Discounted To $19.99 On Amazon With Coupon Code [Deal Alert] Anker 40W 5-Port USB Charging Station Discounted To $19.99 On Amazon With Coupon Code 


If you want to charge all the things in one spot, you're probably going to need more USB ports. Today we've come across an Anker 40W USB charging station rocking five of them. We previously pointed one of these out back at the beginning of this year, and this model is just like that one, only better. Rather than&nbsp;25W, we're looking at 40.
Since this model spits out more juice, the price is slightly higher. Instead of $19.99, it's going for $25.99. But there's a way to bring that number right back down to 20 bucks. Just enter the coupon code&nbsp;20DF7105&nbsp;at checkout to knock $6 off the price.

This is a limited-time promotion, so don't sit on the coupon code for too long. On the positive side, if you decide to purchase more than one charging station, the discount will&nbsp;apply to each. So if five ports aren't enough, you know what to do.
