BERLIN â€” Lenovo just couldn't wait until its Thursday event here at IFA; the company had to launch something today as well. The Lenovo Tab S8 is a thin, light and affordable Android 8-inch tablet, powered by a quad-core Intel Atom processor. 
It sports a 1920x1200 pixel screen, an 8-megapixel rear camera (coupled by a 1.6-megapixel one on the front), 2GB of RAM, dual front speakers, and runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. 

The tablet weighs 0.65 pounds (295g) and is 0.31-inches (7.9mm) thin, which makes it one of the lighter and thinner tablets in its category. 
For all that, the price sounds quite reasonable: $199. The Lenovo Tab S8 will become available in September with major retailers and at Lenovo's website.
