The long awaited BMW M4 convertible has officially been unveiled and marks the fifth generation for the model line including all the M3 convertibles of the past. The M4 convertible combines the elegant lines of the 4 Series convertible with the aggressive styling of the M4 coupe. The front of the M4 convertible features larger bumpers combined with the sculpted bonnet from the M4 coupe. At the rear, the M4 convertible includes the distinctive quad exhaust setup along with an inbuilt diffuser into the rear bumper.

The BMW M4 convertible is powered by the new 3.0-litre, in-line 6-cylinder, twin turbocharged engine, which makes 435PS of peak power and 550Nm of peak torque. The new 2014 M4 convertible is also 60kg lighter than its predecessor with extensive use of aluminum and carbon-reinforced plastic construction that helps give the M4 the best possible performance. The M4 also employs clever aerodynamic aids like air curtains and special M-gills to allow better airflow below the car and around the wheel wells.

The M4&rsquo;s metal folding roof can go from fully open to fully closed, and vice versa in just 20 seconds and can be operated to speeds up to 18kmph. The Roof is lined with a special noise absorbent lining that helps with lower noise inside the car and also to keep the car warmer in the winters. BMW has also offered customers with an array of personalisation options with the BMW Individual program. The M4 convertible can be had in a range of colors including an array of metallic and matte shades that help the car stand out.

Similarly, the M treatment on the interior continues with sportier seats and an array of driver aids to help with performance. The M4 convertible comes with an 8-speed gearbox and paddle shifters. The driver can choose between comfort, sport and sport+ modes, all of which drastically change the car&rsquo;s behavior and power delivery. Expect the BMW M4 convertible to make it to India in the next few months and be priced slightly more than the M4 coupe.
