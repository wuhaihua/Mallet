GTA 5 Release Date For PC, PS4 And Xbox One Appears On Newegg GTA 5 Release Date For PC, PS4 And Xbox One Appears On Newegg 
Grand Theft Auto 5 has been around for quite some time now on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Fans of the popular Rockstar franchise have been waiting patiently for GTA 5 release on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Rockstar has confirmed that the launch will definitely take place this year but up till now it has not confirmed exactly when this will happen. The GTA 5 release date for the aforementioned platforms has appeared online at a major online retailer.

The last report we had about the GTA 5 release date for PC, PS4 and Xbox One come from the people at GAME who claimed that November 1st has been pegged as the &#8220;provisional release date&#8221; for this title. There was no confirmation or denial from Rockstar.
November 14th has also been cited as a possible release day by a handful of retailers but it too has not been confirmed. The GTA 5 release date that appeared on popular online retailer Newegg points us towards November 18th. If this turns out to be true that&#8217;s when the title will be released for PC, PS4 and Xbox One.
Seeing as how this release date is linked with Newegg gives us some hope that it might be true. Rockstar is still keeping mum and so far has not confirmed if November 18th really is the date when GTA 5 finally launches for these platforms. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on this and let you know when it finally breaks its silence.
