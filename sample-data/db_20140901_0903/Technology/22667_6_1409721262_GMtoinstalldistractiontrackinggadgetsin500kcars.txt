        			If you're on the road, there's a good chance that you've fired off at least one text message while behind the wheel. Distracted driving is a perilous activity for all involved, but that hasn't stopped many drivers from updating statuses, responding to snapchats, and other similar activities while behind the wheel. Various "nanny" systems have been proposed that will take action against this, and it seems GM will be the first automaker to mass produce vehicles with such a system in place.This information comes from The Financial Times, which says it was informed of the move by "people with knowledge of the plans." According to these sources, Takata and Seeing Machines have recently partnered up to provide General Motors with eye and head tracking gadgets that monitor for distraction.Up to 500,000 vehicles will be equipped with the technology over the next three to five years, according to these people, which will make GM the first US automaker to mass produce cars with anti-distraction systems in place.Says the sources, this anti-distraction system will keep an eye on where the driver's eyes and head are, watching to make sure he or she is looking at the various mirrors and the road ahead often enough. The functionality could then be expanded in the future as it becomes more common.SOURCE: Financial Times
