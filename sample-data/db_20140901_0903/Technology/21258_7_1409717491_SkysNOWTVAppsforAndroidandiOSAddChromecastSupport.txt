Sky's NOW TV Apps for Android and iOS Add Chromecast Support Sky's NOW TV Apps for Android and iOS Add Chromecast Support Sky’s mobile apps for its NOW TV streaming service have been updated today to add key new functionality – Google Chromecast support.
Quietly added into the existing apps without fanfare, the feature finally allows users to cast TV shows, movies and sporting events to a TV, rather than being forced to watch back on a mobile device or via a desktop/laptop browser. It also means there’s little need to buy the Roku-made £10 NOW TV streaming box to achieve the same thing.

The update is available for Android and iOS now, but you’ll need to be a paying NOW TV customer to take advantage of the new feature. Pricing for the Entertainment, Movies and Sports packages vary, but starts from around £5 per month.
