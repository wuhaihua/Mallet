Google holding event in India on September 15, Android One on the way? Google holding event in India on September 15, Android One on the way? 

Google has sent out invitations for a press event in India taking place on September 15. The invitation simply says "Block Your Date" for Monday, September 15 at 12 noon, promising more details as the event approaches. Given recent reports of devices launching in India soon, the event likely revolves around Android One.



Android One is Google's attempt to make it easier for hardware vendors to make Android phones for emerging markets. Google will pre-select components and vendors in an effort to help hardware makers create decent devices at a lower cost. We've heard about a major advertising push in India surrounding Android One fairly recently, and three Indian manufacturers, Micromax, Spice, and Karbonn, have been announced as partners.

What do you think Google will announce on September 15? Let us know below in the comments.
