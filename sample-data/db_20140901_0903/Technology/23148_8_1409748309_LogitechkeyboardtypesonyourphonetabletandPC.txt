Hyper-connected, always-online people often juggle multiple gadgets while sending text messages. What do you do if you have more devices than hands?Logitech’s answer is a multi-OS keyboard that can work with up to three devices, either mobile or desktop, at once.The Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480, advertised as the first of its kind, has a dial on the left side that controls the device’s wireless links. It can alternate the Bluetooth connection with, for example, a PC, smartphone or tablet.It works with Windows, Mac and Chrome computers, as well as Android and iOS mobile devices.The 820-gram keyboard also has a slot to park your smartphone or tablet for reading as you type—as long as it isn’t thicker than 10.5 millimeters.Logitech suggests the K480 might be used as follows: while typing a report on a computer, a user could turn the dial to type a response to an SMS text on a smartphone, then turn it again to dash off a Twitter message via a tablet.It might seem like the perfect device to keep you distracted and make sure you never finish that report. But Logitech, which launched an illuminated keyboard for TVs earlier this year, sees the K480 as a productivity tool.“Typing needs have evolved and consumers are computing and texting across multiple screens, often using two or three different operating systems,” Charlotte Johs, global vice president of computer peripherals at Logitech, said in a release, adding the keyboard “makes it simple for people to work, create or communicate quickly and comfortably, no matter what computing device or platform they are using.”Available in white or black, the K480 will be available in the U.S. and Europe from September and will have a suggested price of US$49.99.
