Possible Sony Xperia Z3 Dimensions Teased Possible Sony Xperia Z3 Dimensions Teased As we all know, IFA 2014 is around the corner and based on the leaks and rumors, it seems that Sony has a couple of things that they are planning on announcing. For starters we can probably look forward to an announcement of the Sony Xperia Z3, the Xperia Z3 Compact, and maybe even the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact.
However in a recent teaser image uploaded by Sony onto Twitter, it seems that they are teasing the dimensions of one of their mobile devices. As you can see in the image above, they are teasing a device which measures 124mm x 6.4mm. Based on that we can safely rule out a tablet, even if it was a compact one, which means that we can either look forward to the Xperia Z3 or Xperia Z3 Compact.
Then again the Xperia Z3 would be Sony’s flagship device and it would make more sense for them to talk about that, so there is a good chance that the measurements listed above could very well be for the Xperia Z3. Of course there are other products that Sony has planned, such as the QX30 lens-style camera, but for now it seems like a safe bet that it could be the Xperia Z3.
In any case we guess we’ll just have to wait for Sony’s official announcement at IFA 2014, so be sure to check back with us during the week for the details.
