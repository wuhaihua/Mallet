This is our best look yet at the fully assembled iPhone 6 This is our best look yet at the fully assembled iPhone 6 
					Apple will unveil the iPhone 6 in a week during a special media event that has already been confirmed by the company, but that doesn’t mean the iPhone 6 leaks have stopped. In fact, after Feld &amp; Volk last week released a video showing a fully assembled 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model (with help of the available alleged iPhone 6 components that can already be found in the wild), YouTube channel Rozetked has posted an even longer video showing a similarly assembled iPhone 6 unit, complete with commentary.FROM EARLIER: Watch a fully assembled iPhone 6 boot up for the very first timeWhile in this video the iPhone 6 doesn’t boot up like in the previous short video posted by Feld &amp; Volk, the guys at Rozetked do show the 4.7-inch iPhone from all angles and detail the various design changes that are expected for this year’s iPhone generation, all in line with what previous designs have suggested.The iPhone 6 is bigger yet slimmer than the iPhone 5s, which also appears in the video for comparison purposes, and features a design that’s more similar to the iPod touch than to previous-generation iPhones.Rozetked highlights several design elements, including the bigger Touch ID Home button that appears to have smaller metal edges, the rear Apple logo that it claims it’s made of Liquidmetal (although a recent leak said that’s not the case), the protruding rear camera complete with a redesigned True Tone flash, but also internal components of the upcoming handset, such as the Apple A8 chip and NFC support.The full video follows below, and while it’s in Russian, subtitles are available for this hands-on iPhone 6 preview.
