China Mobile Accepts iPhone 6 Preorders China Mobile Accepts iPhone 6 Preorders The iPhone 6 from Apple is not ready to be unveiled until this coming September 9th, but this does not mean that interest has flatlined, but on the contrary, parties such as China Mobile has begun to accept preorders for not one, but both iPhone 6 models &#8211; namely the 4.7” and the 5.5” variant. This is more or less an unofficial confirmation that there will indeed be a 5.5” iPhone 6 device that is set to roll out.
China Mobile happens to be the world&#8217;s largest carrier due to the sheer population in China, and the company has restricted preorders to its online store. Ever since the company began to accept these preorders, China Mobile managed to ring up over 33,000 reservations &#8211; sounds like a whole lot, but it isn’t if you were to take into consideration at just how many people there are in China alone. An anonymous source who claims to be familiar with the timing of the launch touted that the upcoming iPhone 6 will be released in China some time in the middle of September. 
For those who are interested in picking an iPhone 6 up, or decide to reserve a spot, it might cost somewhere in the equivalent of $810 to do so over in China &#8211; insane! It remains to be seen how Apple’s latest smartphone will sell when it goes up against the like of homegrown champions, so to speak, like Meizu and Xiaomi.
