Fleksy has partnered with Samsung to bring their keyboard to the Samsung Gear S smartwatch. Fleksy will be completely integrated into the smartwatch as a system-wide keyboard, available at launch of the Gear S at no additional cost.



Fleksy already makes an app for Samsung's Gear 2 smartwatch, Fleksy Messenger, which Fleksy says it will still support. Fleksy combines gestures with a powerful autocorrect to make typing on any size screen as easy and conveniant as possible.
