Hey guys, did you know that Dodge builds a 707-horsepower Challenger? Crazy, right!? Well, that crazy vehicle was recently driven on a crazy wet race track by a crazy cool reviewer — Matt Farah. And if anyone knows a thing or two about power, it’s him.

Watch as Matt Farah takes the Challenger SRT Hellcat through the ringer:
