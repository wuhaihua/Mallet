Samsung Unveils Curved Soundbar For IFA 2014 Samsung Unveils Curved Soundbar For IFA 2014 While there are some users who prefer bookshelf speakers or larger tower-like speakers, sometimes space can be a bit constrained and thatâ€™s where soundbars come into the picture. Due to the compact nature, they can typically be fit underneath or on top of your television set and if you had your eye on a new soundbar speaker, you might be interested to learn that Samsung has something for you.
The South Korean tech giant is expected to show off a new soundbar at IFA 2014. However what makes this particular soundbar interesting is the fact that it is curved. It will feature a width of 42mm and a curvature radius of 4,200mm. So if you had your eyes on a curved TV from Samsung or if you already have one, we reckon this soundbar will fit just fine.
The soundbar will sport 8.1 channel support and will sport speaker units on either end of the device, which hopefully will allow a larger soundscape compared to regular soundbars or speaker units. The unit can also be controlled by the Samsung TV remote control and will pair with television sets via the TV SoundConnect technology, assuming that your TV supports it, of course.
Pricing and availability of the curved soundbar from Samsung remains unknown for now, but hopefully more will be revealed at IFA 2014 which will be kicking off this week, so be sure to check back with us later in the week for the details!
