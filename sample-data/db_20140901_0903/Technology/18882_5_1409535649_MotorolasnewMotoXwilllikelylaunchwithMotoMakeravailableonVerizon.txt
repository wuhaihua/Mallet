Motorola’s new Moto X will likely launch with MotoMaker available on Verizon Motorola’s new Moto X will likely launch with MotoMaker available on Verizon We&#8217;re still waiting on the Moto X+1 to be officially announced sometime this week by Motorola, but in the meantime we can still speculate on rumors about how the device will launch. The latest leak pinpoints what variations of the device will be available on Verizon&#8217;s network, and if you were bummed that MotoMaker was AT&amp;T exclusive for a few months last time around, you&#8217;ll be very happy to hear that the customization process should be available to Verizon customers right out of the gate.A listing in Verizon&#8217;s retail systems was leaked that shows four new options that are soon to be added: the new Moto X in black, the new Moto X in white/bamboo, and two MotoMaker listings for 16 and 32 GB varieties. This likely means that Verizon will offer 16 GB white and black models in store (with the white version equipped with a bamboo back) and tickets for MotoMaker in store, and that all four options should be available at the same time.We haven&#8217;t heard anything about MotoMaker being available on other carriers, but hopefully Motorola will be able to launch everything simultaneously on all four major carriers this time around.source: Phandroid&nbsp;
