Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Price Leaked (Rumor) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Price Leaked (Rumor) While the world looks on in anticipation where the Apple iPhone 6 is concerned, do remember that there are other players in the market as well, and it looks as though the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 too, will cause quite a stir when it is released. This is a high end phablet, and apparently its price has already been spotted on Media Markt, which so happens to be the world&#8217;s second largest electronics retailer right after Best Buy. If you have not heard of Media Markt before, that is all right, since it is the top electronics retailer in Europe, and the Galaxy Note 4 pricing has been spotted in the Russian branch, which does look as though it will be similarly priced to that of its predecessors during the launch period.
In other words, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is not going to come cheap, so you would be well advised to start saving up if you would want to upgrade your current smartphone or phablet to the latest model. 
The Russian pricing points to the region of 34 490 rubles, which is more or less $940 after conversion without taking carrier subsidies into consideration. If one were to follow the general rule of thumb that electronics prices in Europe &#8211; Moscow in particular, happen to be 20-30% higher, when could be be looking at a $750 launch price or the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Stateside?
