        			Toyota has priced up its new 2015 Camry and Camry Hybrid, and the sedan that has proved America's best-selling car over the past twelve years straight will kick off from just shy of $23k. Price changes among the entry-level trims are almost unchanged over last year's car, Toyota claims, and there's a new XSE version with sportier looks for those who might consider the Camry a little too mainstream for their driveway.The cheapest model will be the Camry LE, with 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 178 HP and 170 lb-ft of torque; it'll come in at $22,970. Your money will get you an 8-way power driver's seat and passenger auto-up/down electric window, among other features.The Camry SE keeps the LE specs but adds smoked chrome trim on the outside and a 4.2-inch display in the center console, along with a direct tire pressure monitoring system. It comes in at $24,840 with the same engine.$26,150 gets either the Camry XLE or Camry XSE, also with the 2.5-liter engine. They have leather-trimmed and heated seats, Entune Audio Plus infotainment, and LED running lights. The XLE gets a four-way power passenger seat and 17-inch alloy wheels with a super-chrome finish; the XSE gets leather-trimmed and Ultrasuede seats, and 17-inch alloys with machined face and black face.$31,370, meanwhile, gets either the Camry XSE or Camry XLE, both with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (268 HP) and, like all the non-hybrid models, a six speed auto transmission. Both have LED high and low headlamps, Smart Key entry, Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and Toyota's app suite, accessed via a 7-inch touchscreen, and a power tilt/slide moonroof. They also have Qi wireless charging for a smartphone, among other features.As for the Camry Hybrid, that comes in LE, SE, and XLE trims for $26,790, $27,995, and $29,980 respectively. Each have a 4.2-inch infotainment screen and 8-way power driver's seat; the SE upgrades to SofTex sport fabric on the seats, leather trim to the dash, and Bluetooth. Finally, the XLE has leather seats with heating, LED daytime running lights, 17-inch wheels and pressure monitoring.Hybrids have a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and E-CVT gearbox paired with battery assist.All models are expected to hit forecourts in the US in late September.
