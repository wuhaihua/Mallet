You Don't Need To Buy An iPhone 6, But This Is How Apple Will Make You Upgrade You Don't Need To Buy An iPhone 6, But This Is How Apple Will Make You Upgrade With just over a week to go until what everyone is assuming will be Apple’s launch event for the iPhone 6 on September 9th, I want to take a moment to remind everyone that&nbsp;after the keynote, everything about their current phone will… still be the same. No features are going to be taken away,&nbsp;elements of the hardware are not&nbsp;going to be switched off, your case will still fit,&nbsp;it will look exactly the same. 
Yet many people will be ready and eager to move up to the new iPhone.
	
								 
One of the greatest impacts that presentations such as the one we are expecting from the Flint Center in Cupertino is that&nbsp;they do&nbsp;change something. They change the perception of the smartphone ecosystem, making other phones somehow seem lesser, and unworthy.&nbsp;You could say that these keynotes distort reality. 
This is one of the key points to understand not just of Apple’s business model, but in the model of the majority&nbsp;of smartphone manufacturers – the profits will keep coming in only if&nbsp;consumers keep buying new handsets. If everyone&nbsp;can coast along&nbsp;with&nbsp;the core functions they&nbsp;use&nbsp;every day on handsets from three or four&nbsp;years ago, that market disappears.
								
										 
It is true to say that nothing changes on your older smartphone, but there are other ways to depreciate the experience and create the feeling that ‘the grass is greener on this side’ with a new handset over time. Typically over two years, the life of a standard contract. 
New handsets are expensive, especially at the high-end with devices like the iPhone 6, the Samsung&nbsp;Galaxy S5, and the&nbsp;Microsoft Lumia 1020. By placing the majority of the cost into the subsidy and having the&nbsp;’pay on the day’ price of $99 or $199 for the big phones, the&nbsp;perception of cost is minimised.&nbsp;And of course if you don’t upgrade at the end of a&nbsp;two-year&nbsp;phone contract, you don’t get a discount on the ‘paying off your handset’ portion. The system is geared up to push you gently into buying a new phone at the end of each contract. 
 
There is a level of entropy in the current smartphone technology, the battery is a classic example. While batteries continue to hold charge&nbsp;after two or three years, the&nbsp;chemical breakdown means that less energy can be stored and produced in older battery cells. With many handsets sealing the battery in to the smartphone casing and charging relatively high values for a simple replacement,&nbsp;after&nbsp;two years, with a weak battery, and a replacement cost that is more than the cost of a new handset (on contract),&nbsp;the experience guides a consumer&nbsp;towards a new handset.
										
										 
While it is not as noticeable, other areas also weaken; screen brightness lessens in some technology, the firmness and action of buttons, the grip on USB connectors and headphone jacks, all of these will wear down through continued use. Once you reach the&nbsp;two-year&nbsp;mark, your handset is no longer going to be in perfect operating condition no matter how well you&nbsp;look after it. 
Software is continually updated, both at the operating system level, and in the complexity of the&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;offerings. The latest versions of&nbsp;iOS&nbsp;and Android put heavier demands on the CPU, the GPU, the memory, the batter, and&nbsp;other electronic components. Try running these platforms on older hardware and there is a natural degradation in performance.&nbsp;There is no easy way to switch out a CPU in a smartphone, so the only option is to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;another handset to run the latest OS. Or you have the latest OS so get the latest hardware. It’s a circular answer that’s only really answered with ‘buy, buy, buy!’ 
Do you need those new OS features?&nbsp;Probably not. Realistically we are talking about edge cases in terms of new features across the platforms. They’re dressed up as&nbsp;must-haves&nbsp;and aids to productivity, but you managed fine without them for so long. Why do you want them now? 
Smartphones have moved beyond being simple tools, and into the world of fashion. From&nbsp;the splash of colors over the Lumia range and the iPhone 5C, to the&nbsp;customised covers of the&nbsp;Moto&nbsp;X and the countless cases for every major handset model on the market, it has become less about what a phone can do and more about how it looks. The social pressure to have ‘the’ phone of the season is far more powerful&nbsp;for many consumers. 
It’s about being cool. If you don’t have a cool phone, then it doesn’t matter that your phone can do everything you need it to do, in certain peer groups you’re no longer cool. Subtly build on that pressure with product placement, personal endorsements, and ongoing advertising campaign, and you can build on that itch. 
 
To return to the subject, of course you don’t need the latest iPhone (or the latest Motorola, Samsung, Sony,&nbsp;HTC, or whatever catches the&nbsp;buzz&nbsp;during September). If you were to sit down and list the features you want on a piece of paper, independent of your current mobile platform, you’d probably find a match for your current phone. or the phone one or two generations back that you really liked. 
That doesn’t sell phones though. That doesn’t boost the balance sheet&nbsp;of the major manufacturers. That doesn’t keep you hungry for more, putting away money in a savings account for a phone that doesn’t&nbsp;(yet)&nbsp;officially exist. The biggest success of the smartphone manufacturers is creating the&nbsp;human demand to keep updating&nbsp;their&nbsp;smartphones. Step back from the bluster, and you realise that you can step off the&nbsp;obsolescence&nbsp;obsession express whenever you want, and everything will be fine. 
  That said, written down on my piece of paper is ‘everyone will ask me what I think of the iPhone 6′, and&nbsp;I’ll be expected to write knowledgeably about the handset. So I guess that I’ll be handing&nbsp;Tim Cook&nbsp;one more sale. 
Will you?
