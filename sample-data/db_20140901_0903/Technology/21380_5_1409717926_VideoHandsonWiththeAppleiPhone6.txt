Video: Hands on With the Apple iPhone 6 Video: Hands on With the Apple iPhone 6 With Apple&#8217;s official iPhone 6 unveiling set to take place just a week from now, it should be no surprise that someone&#8217;s already gotten their hands on one of the highly anticipated devices. Russian website Rozetked obtained an iPhone 6 and has made the first hands-on video review of the device. If this is indeed a mockup or a fake, it&#8217;s a really good one, as the team tears down the iPhone 6 and exposes its guts for the world to see. Are you ready to see what Apple has up their sleeve?
First off, you&#8217;ll notice that the iPhone 6 is a bit larger than the iPhone 5S, coming in at 4.7 inches. The power button has been moved to the side, and the aluminum unibody design makes the iPhone 6 look downright gorgeous. And guess what? they found an NFC chip in Apple&#8217;s new toy, just as some rumors suggested. TouchID is on board, with the ring decreased in size, leaving more room for the sensor. The camera sensor now sticks out a little bit, which could annoy some users. But with such a slim design, Apple had to make sacrifices somewhere.
Check out the video below for your first look at Apple&#8217;s next big thing. Let us know what you think, and if this video is legit or not.
