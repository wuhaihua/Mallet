&nbsp;
Due to its large screen, the refined Multi Window feature is able to maximize the user’s experience providing them with the key to easier multi-tasking. Users can choose how they access their applications with full, split or pop-up screens, and easily change the size and positioning of apps on the screen with one intuitive swipe.
