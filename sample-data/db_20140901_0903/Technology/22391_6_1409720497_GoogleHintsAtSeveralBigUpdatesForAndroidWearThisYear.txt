Google Hints At ‘Several’ Big Updates For Android Wear This Year Google Hints At ‘Several’ Big Updates For Android Wear This Year 
The wearable device trend has picked up a lot of stream this year and Google fanned the flames at I/O a few months back by unveiling a completely new platform that has been developed from the ground up for wearable devices. It is called Android Wear. Many smartwatches powered by Android Wear have already hit the markets and others are bound to pour in soon. Google retains strict control over the software experience and has said that &#8220;several&#8221; updates are planned for the platform which will hopefully be released within 2014.

Android Wear&#8217;s engineering director David Singleton told CNET in an interview that several updates for Android Wear will be released by the end of this year. The first such update is destined to roll out this week. Not only will the updates bring stability and performance improvements they will also include some new features as well.
Some of the features that Singleton has detailed include the ability to pair an Android Wear smartwatch with a Bluetooth headset. Those smartwatches that have GPS built-in will be able to track user&#8217;s fitness sessions based on geolocation data.
Even though some developers have come up with ways to develop their own watchfaces, over time Android Wear developers will be allowed by Google to develop watch faces of their preference with features like stock prices or scores from a sports team front and center in the display.
Google&#8217;s vice president of engineering for Android says that the company aims to improve the Android Wear software as fast as time permits. Since updates don&#8217;t have to go through a carrier its a major hurdle that&#8217;s clear of Google&#8217;s way. It can directly push updates and cut down on the time between release cycles.
