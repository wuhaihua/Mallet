YouTube launches Fan Funding, a virtual tip jar for video makers YouTube launches Fan Funding, a virtual tip jar for video makers Google continues to make their YouTube service more valuable to film-makers and casual users, including the launch of the new Fan Funding feature, which allows the video&#8217;s host to set up a virtual tip jar which fans can contribute to using their Google Wallet. The service, which has so far launched in the USA, Japan, Australia and Mexico, can be used directly from the video&#8217;s page or from the Android app. Obviously YouTube gets a cut of the donations, which in the US equates to 5% of the total donation plus a flat 21 cents.No word on whether or not other payment methods will be accepted, but for now Google Wallet is more than enough. Google plans to launch the feature in other countries soon, but uploaders and viewers in the four aforementioned countries can take advantage of it today. Sound off below with your opinions on YouTube&#8217;s new service.Via: Engadget
