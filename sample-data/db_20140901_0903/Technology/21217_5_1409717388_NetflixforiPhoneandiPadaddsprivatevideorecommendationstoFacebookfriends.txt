Netflix for iPhone and iPad adds private video recommendations to Facebook friends Netflix for iPhone and iPad adds private video recommendations to Facebook friends 

Netflix is now allowing users in the US and Canada to recommend movies and TV shows privately to any of their Facebook friends in a new update for the iPhone and iPad, among other devices.



Netflix states:


  When you finish watching something you'll be asked if you know anyone else who'd like that show, and prompted to find your friends by connecting to Facebook. Connecting will not post to Facebook or share what you watch to your friends' News Feed. After selecting friends from a row of their pictures, and adding an optional message, click Send. Your friends will receive the recommendation the next time they log into Netflix. They can thank you for the recommendation, and if they watch it or add it to their list, we'll let you know.


Netflix adds that any Facebook friends who have not yet connected their account to the streaming video service will get a recommendation message via Facebook Messenger. The update will also be released today for the company's website users, along with the PS3 and Xbox apps and Netflix on set-top boxes and smart TVs. Other platforms will add the update in the coming months.
