        			This weekend's big celebrity photos leak revealed intimate images of many well-known actors, amongst them being Jennifer Lawrence, who has publicly stated through her publicist that "anyone who posts the stolen images" will be prosecuted. According to the Associated Press, the FBI has now gotten involved, and is actively looking into the matter.The announcement was made yesterday, with the FBI announcing that it is investigating the leak -- beyond that, however, it hasn't addressed what it is doing, saying only that it is "aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of materials involving high profile individuals."The cause of the leak has not be identified. Apple's iCloud was originally pegged as the cause of the leaked, and the company's patching of a Find My iPhone exploit -- revealed right before the leak took place -- has lead some to believe that was the cause. Apple is said to still be investigating the issue.Some of the affected celebrities have confirmed the images are real, while others have said that content leaked allegedly of them was fake. Many have decried the action of the yet-unknown hacker(s). Said Mary E. Winstead about the leaks, "Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this."SOURCE: Associated Press
