Bungie Makes a Google Street View Version of Destiny Bungie Makes a Google Street View Version of Destiny 
							
														
							If you can’t wait for Bungie’s highly-anticipated Destiny game to come out next week, the studio has some new content for you. Built using Google Street View technology, the new Destiny Planet View website lets you peruse the game environments on Mars, Venus and the Moon.
 
The interactive tool offers an audio tour of the different planets, videos and images from the game, and a few easter eggs for fans. You’ll also see Google factoids about the real-life planets interspersed throughout Planet View.
Sure, it’s an extended ad for the game, but it’s still a pretty cool idea. Enjoy your time with Planet View, and we’ll see you and your Fireteam in space next week.
