[Weekend Poll] IFA Is Coming: What New Gadgets Are You Most Excited About? [Weekend Poll] IFA Is Coming: What New Gadgets Are You Most Excited About? 




This weekend's poll is going to be a bit different, in that it's sort of a two-parter. Starting on Wednesday, a slew of press conferences and announcements by various Android OEMs will be taking place at the IFA electronics trade show in Berlin - we'll be there to cover it, too! What we want to know is just what announcement you're really on the lookout for.

I've included a list of products we have a good feeling will be at the show (or straight-up confirmation), but feel free to head down to the comments and voice your answer if it's not featured in the poll.
This year's show will likely be big on wearables, with ASUS and LG both confirmed to be unveiling new smartwatches. There's also the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Sony's expected follow-up (if not several) to the Xperia Z2, new phones from Huawei (such as the alleged Ascend Mate 7), new phones from LG like the G3 Stylus, and probably more devices I'm not remembering at the moment. So, cast your vote: which has the most attention from you?
