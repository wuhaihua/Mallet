ISIS mobile payments service rebrands itself as Softcard ISIS mobile payments service rebrands itself as Softcard 

NFC payment service ISIS has unveiled their rebranding, Softcard. The joint payment venture bewteen Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile US announced earlier this year that they would change their name in order to avoid being associated with violence in the Middle East being perpetrated by a group that, at the time, went by ISIS.



Softcard will remain the same service as before, just with a new name. The branding is expected to roll out very soon. It should be noted that the militant group has since changed their own name to ISIL.
