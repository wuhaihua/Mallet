Assembled iPhone 6 Compared To iPhone 5s In Video Assembled iPhone 6 Compared To iPhone 5s In Video 
As we get closer to the 9th of September, you can bet that there will be a ton of iPhone 6-related leaks. Earlier today we took a look at the purported rear shell of the 5.5-inch iPhone and now thanks to a video that surfaced on Russian YouTube channel Rozetked (via 9to5Mac), it shows off an assembled iPhone 6 compared next to an iPhone 5s.
Now we can’t be sure if the parts used in the video are the real deal or if they are assembled using parts based on leaked schematics, which may or may not be accurate, but either way it is safe to say that the phone looks pretty good! In fact in the video it seems that the antenna breaks in between the pieces of metal don’t look as bad as the leaked photos make it out to be.
The protruding camera is still there and hopefully Apple will be able to explain their design choice or justify it at their event on the 9th of September. Other than that it is easy to see that Apple drew inspiration for the phone from their iPad Air and iPad mini designs, choosing to go with a more rounded edge and sides.
We admit we are a little curious as to how much larger the 5.5-inch iPhone will be and how it holds up against the 4.7-inch model and the 4-inch display of the iPhone 5s, but either way do check back with us on the 9th of September for the details!
