Ouya Reportedly Seeking Acquisition By Chinese Companies Ouya Reportedly Seeking Acquisition By Chinese Companies 
Back in August 2012 Ouya emerged on the scene. This startup wanted to create an Android gaming console of the same name. The project got a lot of traction on Kickstarter and its campaign ended up raising over $8 million. The console ultimately came out and Ouya even decided to try its luck by diversifying through a move into software.Â Its no secret though that things haven&#8217;t gone exactly as planned. Ouya is now reportedly in talks for an acquisition, Chinese companies are believed to be involved in discussions with it.

Apparently Ouya is looking at an acquisition as a possible alternative to raising more money. Re/code claims that it is in talks with &#8220;multiple big players in China,&#8221; and while talks are said to be proceeding, Ouya doesn&#8217;t seem to have an offer on the table as yet.
Among the companies reportedly showing interest in Ouya are Chinese behemoths Xiaomi and Tencent apart from others based down in the People&#8217;s Republic. Ouya may also be looking for a suitor in the U.S., the scribe claims there has been &#8220;some engagement&#8221; with the likes of Amazon and Google.
Sources indicate that even if an acquisition goes through it would be more for Ouya&#8217;s talent as opposed to its product. Ouya has been contacted for a comment by the scribe but it is yet to issue a statement regarding the stage of talks and the possibility of an acquisition offer in the near future.
