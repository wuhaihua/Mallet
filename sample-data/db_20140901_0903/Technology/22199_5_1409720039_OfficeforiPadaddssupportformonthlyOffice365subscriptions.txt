Office for iPad adds support for monthly Office 365 subscriptions Office for iPad adds support for monthly Office 365 subscriptions 

Microsoft is now allowing users of its Office for iPad apps to access them via a monthly subscription to Office 365, in addition to the previous yearly subscription support.



This means that users who are signed up to use Office for iPad via Office 365 Personal can now pay $6.99 a month, in addition to the option of paying $69.99 year. Office 365 Home users can now spend $9.99 a month, or they can choose to spend $99.99 a year. In a blog post, Microsoft said:


  These new In-App subscription changes are great options for those who prefer the flexibility of monthly payments.  Existing customers, who have purchased Office 365 Home for one year, will continue on the same subscription. If you buy a monthly subscription on your iPad, you can switch to an annual subscription from your iPad, or from iTunes on your PC or Mac.
