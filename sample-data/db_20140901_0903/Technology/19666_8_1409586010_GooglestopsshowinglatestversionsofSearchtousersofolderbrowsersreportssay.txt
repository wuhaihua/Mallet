Google stops showing latest versions of Search to users of older browsers, reports say Google stops showing latest versions of Search to users of older browsers, reports say Google is reportedly blocking certain older browsers from seeing the latest version of its search engine. A weekend complaint on Google&#8217;s product forums from someone using Opera 12 (the current version is 23) and seeing an older version of Google Search, elicited a response from a Google engineer stating that this &#8220;isn&#8217;t a bug, it&#8217;s working as intended.&#8221; As the BBC noted, Google has been encouraging the use of more &#8220;modern&#8221; browsers since 2011, when it stopped supporting older browsers for Gmail users. The engineer said newer browsers were needed to support Google&#8217;s &#8220;improvements&#8221; to search, though people should of course be using up-to-date browsers for security purposes anyway.
