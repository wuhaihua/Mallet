The Levante that has been caught testing seems to be based on the Ghibli, but with some distinctive changes including flared wheel arches, raised height and a revised roofline. That said, the production version is expected to gain its design cues from the Kubang concept.&nbsp;The car is expected to be powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine that pump power of 530 horses and also a 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel that will churn 275PS of power. Both these engines will be mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Making it an able off-road machine will be the Maserati Q4 all-wheel drive system. The Italian marque is also expected to borrow some electronic assistance from Chrysler and sister brand Jeep. In fact, its underpinnings are developed over the ones used on the Grand Cherokee. The production version is unlikely to look like the current test mules as it will gain inspiration from the Kubang concept that was showcased in 2011. Maserati will begin production of its upcoming SUV sometime in 2015. The Maserati Levante will take on the likes of the Porsche Cayenne and the BMW X6.&nbsp;
