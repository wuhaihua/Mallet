  Apple has reached an agreement with American Express to work together on its new iPhone payments system, according to sources familiar with the talks. American Express is one of several partners Apple will need to sign up before it can launch its new payments plan, which sources say it plans to announce at its September 9 product event.


An NFC-powered mobile payments system has been rumored as part of Apple's September 9 event. Apple has also earlier been reported to have made a similar agreement with Visa over such a system.
