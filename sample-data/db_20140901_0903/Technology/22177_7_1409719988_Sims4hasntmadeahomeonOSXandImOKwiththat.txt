Sims 4 hasn't made a home on OS X, and I'm OK with that Sims 4 hasn't made a home on OS X, and I'm OK with that 	

Today&apos;s big release of Sims 4 was not celebrated by OS X devotees thanks to EA&apos;s decision to make the game a Windows-only affair, at least for the time being. An FAQ posted on the Sims 4 website makes the potential future of a Mac edition unclear, noting only that there are &quot;no updates on Mac at this time.&quot;You know what? Fine.It wasn&apos;t that long ago that we got to see exactly what EA is capable of with the refresh of SimCity. After a launch on PC that was plagued with a completely busted (yet mandatory) online component, the OS X version of the game similarly stumbled out of the gate when it was launched months later. EA&apos;s forums were overrun with gamers claiming that the Mac version froze upon launch, crashed randomly, and -- to sum it all up -- was completely unplayable.Aside from complaints that the game is too dumbed down or simply not as good as Sims 3, Sims 4&apos;s PC release seems to be faring better than SimCity&apos;s. That being said, many customers still have a horrible taste in their mouths from the SimCity disaster, and unless EA puts the Mac port of Sims 4 in the hands of Mac publisher Aspyr -- which has proven itself multiple times with iOS and OS X ports of games like KOTOR, BioShock Infinite, and even SimCity 4 and Sims 2 -- I&apos;m perfectly fine with EA having no news about a Mac release of Sims 4.It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t want to play the new Sims title. In fact, it looks like it would be a blast to play... but only if it actually works. At the moment, I&apos;m just not sure I trust EA to deliver a playable game on OS X, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone.
