Sky's NOW TV adds Google Chromecast support in latest update Sky's NOW TV adds Google Chromecast support in latest update 

Sky has updated its NOW TV mobile apps to add Google Chromecast support, enabling consumers to stream their favorite shows to a television and opening up a world of entertainment on a larger screen.



What's neat about this latest update is that Sky is making it so the Roku NOW TV streaming box is no longer required to enjoy the same functionality. Simply download (or update) the Sky NOW TV Android app and you're good to go.

While the app is available for free on both Android and iOS, those who download the app will require a NOW TV subscription to make full use of included functionality. Already updated and enjoying the new Chromecast support? Let us know your initial thoughts in the comments.
