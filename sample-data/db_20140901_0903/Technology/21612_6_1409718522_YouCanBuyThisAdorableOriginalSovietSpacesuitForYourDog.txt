The suit is believed to have been used by the dogs Belka and Strelka for the USSR&#8217;s Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission &#8212; the first of Russia&#8217;s space dogs to actually return to Earth safely. In fact, Strelka later gave birth to six puppies &#8212; and one was given to John F. Kennedy&#8217;s family.
