New info suggests AT&T will have very brief Moto Maker exclusivity period New info suggests AT&T will have very brief Moto Maker exclusivity period Some new information suggests AT&amp;T will have a very small window of exclusivity with Moto Maker for the new Motorola Moto X+1. Previous reports suggested the new Motorola device&#8217;s Moto Maker customization would be available on both AT&amp;T and Verizon, possibly with simultaneous launches and availability. Now sources are saying AT&amp;T will actually get a brief three-day period when they will be the exclusive source for theÂ Moto Maker program.Verizon fans may be bummed by this, but it is still a big improvement compared to last year&#8217;s launch when AT&amp;T had a much longer exclusive period for Moto Maker. There is still no word on when T-Mobile or Sprint may carry the device or get access to the Moto Maker program. That information may come out in the next few days though once the device is officially announced.source: TK Tech News
