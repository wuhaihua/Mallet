The offer applies to those with a One M8, Desire 816, and the Desire 610 — plus a number of popular devices that were launched last year. But there are some caveats.The full list of eligible handsets — along with the amount of storage each one qualifies for — is as follows:One M8: +100GB for two yearsDesire 816: +100GB for two yearsDesire 610: +100GB for two yearsOne max: +100GB for two yearsOne M7: +25GB for two years*Butterfly S: +25GB for two years*One mini: +25GB for two years*Desire 601: +25GB for two years**These handsets are only eligible for free Google Drive storage after they have received a Sense 5+ or Sense 6 upgrade.Google says that free storage must be redeemed by January 1, 2016, and it&#8217;s only available to those who purchased their handsets as new; used and refurbished devices do not qualify. What&#8217;s more, if you&#8217;ve unlocked your bootloader, you&#8217;re not entitled to anything, either.To find out if you have free Drive storage, open up the Drive app on your HTC device and press the “Redeem” button.
