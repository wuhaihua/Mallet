The best Android apps and games: August 2014 The best Android apps and games: August 2014 August was a pretty crazy month in the Android world. While there were no major device launches, quite a few popular apps and games did make their way to the Play Store, making it a good month for Android users all over the world.So without further ado, scroll below to check out our list of the top apps and games released last month. TapPathTapPath comes from the developer of Link Bubble and Action Launcher, Chris Lacy. True to his style, the app offers a very unique functionality that has never been offered before by any app on the Play Store.The app allows users to customize the action on single, double and triple tapping a web link. For example, users can customize the triple tap on a web link to automatically share the link to Pocket or PushBullet or perhaps open it in Link Bubble.TapPath is definitely a must-have app provided it fits your use case scenario.Download: TapPathHTC ZoeHTC&#8217;s Zoe app finally made its way to other Android devices last monthReleased by the new Creative Labs division at HTC, the Zoe app brings the popular Video highlights feature of Sense to all other Android devices. As described by HTC, the video editing application allows users to &#8220;create, share and remix professional-quality highlight videos with your friends.&#8221;The app allows users to select pictures and videos from a certain event or day and then compiles them into a beautiful 30 second long video highlight complete with a theme and background audio &#8212; both of which are fully customizable. It works on most of the major Android devices from Samsung and LG running Android 4.4 KitKat.Download: HTC ZoeBlur LauncherThis new launcher from Klinker Brothers (Developers of Talon) is different from a plethora of other launchers available on the Play Store and offers a Google Now style &#8216;pages&#8217; for third-party app integration. This way, users can simply swipe to the left to access the pages of their favorite apps.Klinker brothers have already provided an API for these pages, which means it is now up to third-party app developers to add support for it in their apps.Apart from pages, Blur launcher also packs all the other features that are usually found in a launcher including support for icon packs, gestures, resizable homescreen grids and more.Download: Blur LauncherLast App SwitcherLast app switcher is a must-have app for heavy multi-taskersLast App Switcher allows users to quickly jump from their current app to their last used app and vice versa.

Just like Flappy Birds, Swing Copters features 8-bit graphics and an extremely simple yet tough gameplay.Users are required to guide their character who has a propellor on his head without smashing into any obstacle. While the premise is simple, Dong has made the game extremely tough and actually rolled out an update last week to make it less frustrating to play.Download: Swing CoptersSurgeon SimulatorSurgeon Simulator is currently only available for Android tabletsEver wanted to experience how doing a surgery feels like?

Your hands are shaking and you don&#8217;t really have all the appropriate tools for the surgery, which makes saving Bob a near impossible task.As stated by my colleague Killian, Surgeon Simulator &#8220;is one of the most stupid games you&#8217;ll ever play, and also one of the most enjoyable.&#8221; Sadly though, the game is currently only available for Android tablets.Download: Surgeon SimulatorALONE&#8230;In Alone, users control a rocket ship travelling through space and it is their duty to make sure that it avoids all the debris, comets and other rocks coming its way.
