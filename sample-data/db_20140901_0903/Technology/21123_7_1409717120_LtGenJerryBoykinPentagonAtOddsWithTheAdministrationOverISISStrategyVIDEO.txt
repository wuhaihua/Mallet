Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin: Pentagon ‘At Odds With The Administration’ Over ISIS Strategy [VIDEO] Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin: Pentagon ‘At Odds With The Administration’ Over ISIS Strategy [VIDEO] Retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin claimed there &#8220;isn&#8217;t any question that the Pentagon is at odds with the administration&#8221; over how to deal with ISIS, noting a palpable &#8220;rift&#8221; between the military and the Obama White House on a strategy for confronting the Islamic terror group.
Boykin spoke Tuesday with Fox News&#8217; Gretchen Carlson about the apparent disconnect between the Pentagon and President Barack Obama&#8217;s messaging on ISIS. Contrary to the president&#8217;s claim that he doesn&#8217;t yet have a strategy, on Tuesday Pentagon spokesman John Kirby insisted the military does have a plan to defeat the Islamic fundamentalists.
&#8220;Is the Pentagon at odds with the White House, or how does that work?&#8221; Carlson asked.
&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that the Pentagon is at odds with the administration at this point,&#8221; Boykin claimed. &#8220;Look, when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs makes a statement on Thursday and then backtracks on Sunday from what he said, it&#8217;s a clear indication that he&#8217;s been given some instructions from the White House to modify what he said.&#8221;
&#8220;There is a rift between the two,&#8221; the former general continued. &#8220;The military wants to take care of this problem. The military sees it as being a situation in which there is, in fact, some military solution to this.&#8221;
Boykin went on to excoriate the president for his &#8220;weakness&#8221; and &#8220;feckless response&#8221; to the beheading of American journalists &#8212; now including Steven Sotloff, who&#8217;s brutal execution was made public in a video released by ISIS on Tuesday. (RELATED: ISIS Beheads American Journalist Steven Sotloff)
