Samsung Gear S Gets A Swarovski Crystal Makeover Samsung Gear S Gets A Swarovski Crystal Makeover Just yesterday we reported that LG and Swarovski had teamed up to offer a crystal-studded OLED TV. Well it looks like Swarovski has been pretty busy because they had also teamed up with the folks at Samsung by creating a blinged up version of the recently announced Samsung Gear S smartwatch.
The smartwatch from Samsung was announced last week and we expect that we will most likely hear and see more of it at IFA 2014 later this week. We’re not sure if the Swarovski version of the Gear S will be on display at IFA 2014, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled for it.
According to Younghee Lee, Executive Vice President of Global Marketing, IT &amp; Mobile Division at Samsung, “One of the key aspects in wearable devices is providing diverse options for consumers to freely express their own taste and style. Our ongoing collaboration with Swarovski as demonstrated in the new Gear S Strap, allows us to stay ahead of trends and on the cutting-edge of design and style.”
No word on how much this blinged out version of the Gear S will cost, but according to Samsung, they expect that the watch will be available for purchase this October either via online or at one of Samsung’s experience stores. We have to admit it’s a little gaudy but if you wanted to jazz up your outfit, perhaps it could get the job done.
