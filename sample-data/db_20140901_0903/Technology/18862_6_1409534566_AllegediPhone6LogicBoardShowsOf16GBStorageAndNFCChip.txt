Alleged iPhone 6 Logic Board Shows Of 16GB Storage And NFC Chip Alleged iPhone 6 Logic Board Shows Of 16GB Storage And NFC Chip Some of the rumors of the iPhone 6 that we have heard recently includes how the phone is expected to sport an NFC chip which will be used to facilitate mobile payments, and how the phone is said to come with 1GB of RAM, which some of you guys have understandably found a little disappointing especially when compared to the competition.
That being said, recent photos have surfaced which shows off a more fully assembled logic board that purportedly belongs to the iPhone 6. On this logic board, as you can see in the image above, it shows off a chip which “confirms” that NFC will be one of the features of the iPhone 6. The chip is apparently made by NXP Semiconductors which is also in line with an earlier rumor.
Also as you can see in the image above, there is a chip provided by Toshiba which is the flash memory module of the phone and appears to be of the 16GB variety. We guess this hardly comes as a surprise since 16GB has been one of the storage options offered by Apple with the iPhone 6.
In any case take it with a grain of salt for now since for all we know, the logic board could either be photoshopped or it could belong to a different device entirely, but with Apple expected to announce it all on the 9th of September, we guess we won’t have to wait too long to find out more!
