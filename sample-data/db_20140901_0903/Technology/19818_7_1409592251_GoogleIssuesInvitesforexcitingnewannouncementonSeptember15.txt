Google Issues Invites for 'exciting new announcement' on September 15 Google Issues Invites for 'exciting new announcement' on September 15 Google has started sending out invites for an event in India in two weeks’ time which could see the launch of the company’s first ‘Android One’ certified devices.
According to NDTV, the event will take place on September 15, but little else is known – not even which city it will be taking place in, let alone details of what is being launched. More details will be provided in due course, the invite says.

Despite a lack of any real hints, the invite is expected to be the launch event for Google’s first Android One devices from manufacturers like Micromax and Karbonn. Android One, announced at Google I/O in June, is Google’s low-cost (sub-$100) standard of devices that run pure Android, free from manufacturer UIs like Sense or TouchWiz - although locally-relevant operator tweaks are allowed.
