        There's been no shortage of parts leaks and even "leaked" iPhones assembled from various parts on the internet in the past few weeks. But the latest leak of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, from Russian YouTuber user Rozetked, might just be the best we've seen so far. As the camera slowly pans over the assembled device, you can get a clear look at the curved edges, large antenna bands, and relocated power button. As 9to5Mac notes, you can also get a (brief) look at the white front panel and compare the space gray color to the iPhone 5S (spoiler: the colors look very similar.)
Everybody is expecting both a 4.7-inch iPhone and a 5.5-inch version at Apple's event on September 9th, not to mention the iWatch. It will be an event so big that Apple built an entirely new, three-story structure for it. So even if you think you know everything about the new iPhones, there's almost surely a surprise or two in store.
