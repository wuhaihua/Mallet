Apple: Celebrity photo breach not due to iCloud or Find my iPhone issues Apple: Celebrity photo breach not due to iCloud or Find my iPhone issues 	

Apple has just released a press statement updating its investigation into the weekend breach of celebrity photos. As noted in the press release, the company says that none of the cases investigated were the result of any breach of Apple&apos;s systems including iCloud and Find my iPhone. Apple believes that it was a &quot;very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions&quot; that caused the breach -- essentially saying that it&apos;s most likely a social engineering attack that made the photos vulnerable to being exposed to the public.Apple reiterates that using a strong password and two-step verification can help protect against this type of attack.
