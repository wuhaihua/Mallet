Report: The Asus Smartwatch Will Cost Less Than $US200 Report: The Asus Smartwatch Will Cost Less Than $US200 We knew that Asus was working on an Android Wear smartwatch, and now we have some details. According to China&#8217;s Central News Agency, the ZenWatch will be announced on Wednesday and sell for less than $US200.

The report explains that Asustek CEO Jerry Shen has let slip that the device will include voice control features &#8212; though it&#8217;s not clear how they will differ from the baked-in Google offering &#8212; as well as looking &#8220;better than competitors&#8217; products.&#8221; Which is perhaps subjective, though you can judge for yourself (a little) in the video, above.
Less subjective is that it will come in one size and work independently of an Android phone (though, clearly, it will work way, way better with one). The new watch will announced at IFA this Wednesday, though it won&#8217;t be available until October, according the report. [Central News Agency via Verge]
