Volvo and safety. The two are synonymous, and thanks to extensive development of new safety systems within the latest Volvo XC90, the lifesaving correlation should remain.
Following the grand reveal of the 2015 XC90, Volvo unveiled this footage of the new SUV during front-offset crash testing (40mph), side impact testing (35mph), and roll-over testing (30mph). And the results look quite extraordinary.


Within the new XC90, Volvo has pioneered a number of advanced active and protective safety systems – all aimed at keeping your family in one piece. These systems include seatbelt pre-tensioners and side curtain airbags on all three rows, an all-new vehicle run-off protection system (reduces spine injuries by one third), as well as advanced auto-braking and object detection systems.
Even after a full rollover crash, none of the XC90’s windows blew out and the overall body structure looks fairly unblemished. And with the lion’s share of future Volvos using the XC90’s new SPA architecture, expect these safety features to fill-in across the range.
