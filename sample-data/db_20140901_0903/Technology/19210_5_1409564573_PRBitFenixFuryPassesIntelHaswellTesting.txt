(PR) BitFenix Fury Passes Intel Haswell Testing (PR) BitFenix Fury Passes Intel Haswell Testing The release of the Fury PSU Series has made serious waves in the hardware community with impressive power specifications and cables featuring all Alchemy sleeving. Another great benefit is high efficiency and cost savings, especially when paired with Intel's Haswell-class processors and their low-power sleep states. To ensure full compatibility with the latest hardware, BitFenix has worked closely with Intel to make sure that Fury delivers according to spec. After recent testing from the Intel labs, the BitFenix Fury PSU Series passed with flying colors, reaffirming their full compatibility with Intel Haswell C6/C7 sleep states.

Intel Haswell C6/C7 is a low-power state that is meant to lower power usage when the system is in sleep mode. The issue arises when certain power supplies are unable to provide a minimum load of 0.05 amps on the 12V2 rail, which can lead to stability issues. However, Fury PSUs are fully compatible with these sleep states, as the Intel testing labs have confirmed. See below for the Haswell test for the Fury 750G:
