Fall TV 2014: 5 new shows to avoid Fall TV 2014: 5 new shows to avoid The broadcast bigwigs would have you believe that every show they put on the air is a potential mind-blowing hit. But we know better, don't we?For each rare prime-time gem, there are numerous duds, flops and downright disasters. And this fall is no different.We waded through the freshman crop and found plenty of cringe-worthy shows. Here are the five that turned us off the most. 1. "Mulaney" (Fox) -- A la "Seinfeld," John Mulaney sort of plays himself -- a stand-up comedian. But the joke is on him, because the episode we saw wasn't even remotely funny.2. "Cristela" (ABC) -- We really want to root for Cristela Alonzo, who is full of bubbly charm. Unfortunately, her sitcom about a law student chasing her dreams is a stale, overly broad, groan-worthy mess.3. "Stalker" (CBS) -- Creator Kevin Williamson says people should change the channel if they don't want to see the brutally depraved violence depicted in this ghastly procedural. We'll gladly comply.4. "Bad Judge" (NBC) -- There's disorder in the court as Kate Walsh plays a party-girl judge. We object! On the other hand, the word "bad" certainly does apply.5. "State of Affairs" (NBC) -- We just couldn't bring ourselves to care about Katherine Heigl's CIA character in this "Scandal" wannabe. Then again, this show could make for a good sitcom.Follow Chuck Barney at Twitter.com/chuckbarney and Facebook.com/bayareanewsgroup.chuckbarney.
