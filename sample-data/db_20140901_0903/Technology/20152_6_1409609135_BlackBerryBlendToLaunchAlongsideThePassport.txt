Users may also be able to create calendar entries.
Those who are using Blend in a corporate environment with BES10 will be able to access the company&#8217;s intranet using the browser. It will also feature support for tasks like backing up or restoring data that were previously possible through the BlackBerry Desktop Software or BlackBerry Link.
BB.in reports that Blend will be supported by BlackBerry devices running OS 10.3 or later. Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.7 or later will be pre-requisites on PC, whereas iOS 6 and Android 4.4 will be required on mobile. BlackBerry is yet to officially confirm Blend.
