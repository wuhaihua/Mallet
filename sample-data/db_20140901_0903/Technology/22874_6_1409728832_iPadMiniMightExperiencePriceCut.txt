iPad Mini Might Experience Price Cut iPad Mini Might Experience Price Cut When it comes to Apple products, most of the time, the device itself is priced at a premium compared to other counterparts that are in the market. The thing is, the slightly higher price point for Apple products has not deterred folks from actually picking up their products, and on the contrary, Apple has grown from strength to strength over the years. In fact, word has it that Apple will lower the price tag for its Wi-Fi-only 16GB iPad mini as an effort to go up against slower iPad sales during this quarter, which means we ought not be subjected to a $299 price point soon.
Digitimes claims that Apple has recently “cooperated” with U.S. retailers such as Best Buy and Amazon in order to reduce the price of the Wi-Fi only 16GB iPad mini. Right now, Best Buy is selling this particular tablet model for $199.99 a pop, where Amazon is carrying a new iPad mini for $230. Despite that, the official price point is still listed at $299 on the company’s website, and there does not seem to be any proof that the official Apple Store would receive a matching price cut in the near future. Would this price cut cause you to actually pick up a new iPad mini anytime soon?
