Samsung Unveils New Stylus-Pen Combo Accessory Samsung Unveils New Stylus-Pen Combo Accessory When it comes to buying stationery, such as pens, you probably would think of brands like Pilot, Parker, Bic, Mont Blanc, and so on, but not Samsung. Well if you were in the market for a new pen that also doubles as a stylus, then perhaps Samsung could be a brand worth taking a look at.
The South Korean tech giant has recently taken the wraps off a new accessory dubbed the EJ-PG900C Cross Ballpoint C Pen. The accessory, like we mentioned earlier, will pull double duty as both a pen and a stylus. This means that you can take it with you to class or to work, but at the same time be able to use it with your smartphone or tablet as well.
The pen is a collaborative effort with Cross, a brand that is known for their writing instruments, so hopefully some of that quality will carry over as well. One end of the accessory will act as a pen and all users will have to do is flip it around to access its capacitive stylus point.
We’re not sure if the EJ-PG900C will play nicely with devices like the Galaxy Note series that has special S Pen related features, but if you just want a regular stylus/pen, then this could be for you. It is priced at £35.00 and if you’d like to learn more, just head on over to Samsung UK’s website for the details.
