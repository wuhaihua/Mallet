The one big reason you may want to hold off on upgrading to iOS 8 The one big reason you may want to hold off on upgrading to iOS 8 
					Apple fans are understandably excited about the release of iOS 8 later this fall, but as with any major update, there might be a few kinks to work out before the latest version of the mobile operating system is running smoothly. Business Insider spoke with app-testing company Applause CMO Matt Johnston about the risks of upgrading as soon as the update goes live.FROM EARLIER: Here are all the reasons why Apple might have rejected your app According to Johnston, most developers have taken advantage of Apple&#8217;s adaptive layout tool in order to ensure that their apps will be ready for iOS 8, regardless of the size of the new iPhone 6 display, but others are waiting until the official announcement on September 9th to begin revamping their apps.As most iOS 8 beta testers will tell you, compatibility issues have been relatively minimal, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering the fact that Apple is already on the sixth beta release. That&#8217;s not to say the transition has been flawless &#8212; Johnston sent Business Insider a few specific examples of popular apps that still haven&#8217;t gotten the hang of iOS 8.First up is OpenTable, which searches for restaurants near San Francisco despite the user being in Framingham, Massachusetts. Next is Marriott&#8217;s official app, failing to display anything other than a navigation bar at the bottom. Finally, the NBA app UI seems to have wandered up into the time and battery life display at the top of the screen.Johnston notes that although the issues will be few and far between, you will undoubtedly find a few if you decide to jump on board the iOS 8 the day it leaves the station.
