Video watch: Latest leak gives the clearest view of the upcoming Apple iPhone 6 Video watch: Latest leak gives the clearest view of the upcoming Apple iPhone 6 
				Is this the new iPhone 6? 
			
									
								September 9 is going to be the D-Day for the next iPhone launch, though the Internet has been abuzz with leaks for months. Closer to the launch, a new YouTube video by Russian user Rozetked, has given us what could be the clearest ever picture of the new iPhone 6.
&nbsp;
The video showcases the 4.7-inch version of the iPhone 6 along with several other leaked aspects that weâ€™ve heard about. The comparison shows both the black and white versions of the phone, and a space grey rear shell as well.
&nbsp;
The video also compares the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 5s and gives a pretty cool look at how the design has changed for the iPhone 6. Sadly, the subtitles don&#8217;t make it clear whether the iPhone 6 has decreased in thickness or not.
&nbsp;
The video gives a clear look at the curved edges, large antenna bands, and relocated power button. According the video, Apple is introducing an NFC chip in the smartphone, which can be seen as confirmation for the Apple mobile payments system. A recent Bloomberg report had said that Apple&#8217;s upcoming iPhone model will feature its own payment platform and is expected to be one of its key features.
