Android One Smartphones Expected At September 15th Event Android One Smartphones Expected At September 15th Event 
At Google I/O earlier this year the company introduced a new program that it calls Android One. The idea here is to aid manufacturers who want to develop low cost Android smartphones based on hardware designs that Google has come up with. Ultimately the aim is to produce quality Android smartphones that are light on the pocket. The first crop of Android One smartphones may be unveiled at an event on September 15th.

Google is believed to be starting off with Android One in India. A report from the country says that Google has sent out invites for an event which is going to take place on September 15th.
The focus at the event will reportedly be on Android One smartphones developed by Micromax, Karbonn Mobile and Spice Mobile, who have already committed to Google that they will be making smartphones under this program.
It is expected that smartphones launched under the Android One program will cost less than $100. Not much is known about the specifications at this point in time, Google has said in the past that they&#8217;re likely to feature 4.5-inch displays with dual-SIM support, FM radio and microSD card support.Â They&#8217;re all likely to be powered by stock Android OS.
Google hasn&#8217;t said if Android One smartphones will make their way to the U.S. The aforementioned manufacturers haven&#8217;t stepped out of their home country as yet so perhaps the company might team up with other manufacturers if Android One smartphones are ever destined to come to North America.
