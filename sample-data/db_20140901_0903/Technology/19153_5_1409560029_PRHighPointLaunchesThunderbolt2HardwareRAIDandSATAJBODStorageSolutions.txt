The RAID controllers and Thunderbolt 2 connections are kept separate from the storage devices, and are housed within the compact adapter module. The storage tower's removable, hot-swappable bays support any industry standard 3.5" SAS and SATA hard drive. Customers can avoid the expense of replacing entire Thunderbolt storage appliances and upgrade at their own pace. Each RocketStor 6300 solution can support daisy chaining, one after another, 7 total devices including Thunderbolt Displays, I/O Adapters, PCIe expansion stations and drive docks.
