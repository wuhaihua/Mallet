Photo: Asus.At IFA 2014 in Berlin, Asus finally announced the ZenWatch, its first wearable powered by Android Wear. Crafted from high-quality materials using traditional watchmaking techniques, it wants to be the prettiest smartwatch you can buy, and also one of the most sophisticated. Asus has been teasing the ZenWatch for over a week, and company CEO Jerry Shen has been building up the hype by promising an attractive device with an affordable price tag that will give existing Android Wear devices a run for their money. And today&#8217;s announcement did not disappoint.The ZenWatch is indeed an impressible good-looking device that sports a metal frame and a genuine stitched-leather strap. Its big, “2.5D curved glass display” makes it clear its a modern wearable gadget, but the rest of the device looks and feels like a traditional watch.Photo: AsusAsus hasn&#8217;t told us exactly what the ZenWatch is packing under the hood, but it did reveal some of its features. All of the basics you&#8217;d expect from Android Wear are here — like the ability to read notifications on your wrist — as well as things like a camera shutter remote and presentation controls.The ZenWatch offers a 9-axis sensor and a heart rate monitor, which work alongside its built-in “wellness manager” to provide you with statistics on things like steps taken, exercise intensity, calories burned, and relaxation level. You can also tell ZenWatch your personal fitness goals and it will help you track them.Photo: AsusThe ZenWatch will cost $199 when it goes on sale, but we&#8217;re still waiting for Asus to confirm when that will be.
