Drone Reveals the First Stages of Apple's New Spaceship Campus Drone Reveals the First Stages of Apple's New Spaceship Campus We may have to wait another week and a half to see what Apple has in store with the iPhone 6 and a possible iWatch, but one drone pilot managed to capture at least one Cupertino secret early: the new Apple spaceship campus. 
Looking like the unearthed remains of a grounded Death Star or the ancient ruins of an alien civilization, the early stages of Apple's new campus construction reveal that the ambitious architectural project is on track. 

The footage was shot by a YouTuber using a GoPro Hero 3+ Black edition and a DJI Phantom 2 drone, which flew from the construction site's perimeter and then over the site itself to deliver the footage. 
However, given Apple's reputation for strict secrecy and the FAA's drone rules, the creator of the video felt the need to add a note about how the footage was acquired. 
In the description accompanying the video, the video uploader wrote: 
The quad copter remained under 400 feet as per FAA regulation for remote controlled airplanes and helicopters and not within any airport no-fly zones. 
The construction of Apple's new campus is expected to be complete in 2016.
