A Rad Mini Grappling Gun You Can Make Out Of Desk Clutter A Rad Mini Grappling Gun You Can Make Out Of Desk Clutter When I was in school, I used poorly engineered retractable pen cannons to fire tiny beads at my friends and enemies during class. I thought it was pretty cool, but this mini grappling gun puts all my pre-adolescent tinkering to shame.

In a quick and easy step-by-step mist8k shows you exactly how you can turn stuff you probably have lying around (a pen, a Paddle Pop stick, a Lego piece, paperclips, etc) into a pretty astonishingly effective little grappling gun. Because, really, what else are you going to accomplish this afternoon? [mist8k]
