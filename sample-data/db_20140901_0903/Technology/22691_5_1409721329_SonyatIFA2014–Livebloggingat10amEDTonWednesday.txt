Phones, tablets, cameras, watches, Sony will have a packed lineup for us


Sony is taking its traditional IFA 2014 slot on Wednesday out in Berlin, getting its press conference out of the way and unleashing its fall product range on us. We're expecting phones, tablets, cameras, watches and who knows what else – probably a good amount of TVs – and we'll be live on the ground and we're bringing you with us.

The event takes place after both Asus and Samsung have had their own respective times in the spotlight, and there's going to be plenty of news to round out a busy, busy day. The event kicks off at 4 p.m. local time here in Berlin which translates back to 10 a.m Eastern and 7 a.m. Pacific.

We'll have a liveblog post going up nearer the time, so keep your eye out for that and be sure to come back and join us to follow the action live!
