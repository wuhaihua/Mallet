FIGHT! Siri and Cortana duke it out in new HTC One M8 for Windows Ad FIGHT! Siri and Cortana duke it out in new HTC One M8 for Windows Ad This isn&#8217;t the first time we&#8217;ve seen Cortana and Siri duke it out, and it won&#8217;t be the last. In a new ad for the HTC One M8 for Windows, Microsoft shows off Cortana on HTC&#8217;s hot hardware while Siri struggles to keep up with what seems like the tiniest screen ever. Cortana proudly brags about her two front-facing speakers. When Cortana asks Siri where her speakers are, she sheepishly replies, &#8220;I have one. And I&#8217;m sitting on it.&#8221; BURN!
While I&#8217;m not so sure that Cortana is superior to Siri, Microsoft&#8217;s digital assistant is pretty functional, and is certainly getting better with each update. But with Apple&#8217;s big day coming up in a little over a week, it&#8217;s quite possible that the Cupertino company could have some new tricks for Siri that will blow Cortana away. We&#8217;ll see..until then, enjoy this video!
