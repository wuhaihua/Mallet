These Philippe Starck Bicycle Helmets Look Too Good To Wear These Philippe Starck Bicycle Helmets Look Too Good To Wear 
With their slinky curves, space-age visors and sleek polished metallic finish, you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that these helmets were part of the costume design for a futuristic movie. Nope, they&#8217;re just Philippe Starck&#8217;s bicycle helmets.

Citing the world of motorcycling as his source of inspiration, Starck has teamed up with California-based Giro to create these helmets. The S+ARCKBIKE lids are made of aluminium and have a cork liner to protect against injury. You may think that cork is a bad choice, but it meets 45km/h EAPC regulations, and is water-resistant and anti-mcrobial to boot. So that&#8217;s something. The visors are there to &#8220;protect from the cold and projectiles.&#8221;
They&#8217;re not perhaps the most practical of helmets, but they do look amazing. Pricing and availability are yet to be announced. [Moco Loco]
