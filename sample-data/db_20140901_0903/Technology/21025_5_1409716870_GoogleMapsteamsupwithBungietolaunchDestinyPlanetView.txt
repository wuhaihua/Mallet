Game developer Bungie is teaming up with Google Maps for a new way to promote its upcoming sci-fi first person shooter Destiny. Today sees the launch of Destiny Planet View, which presents a fictional version of Google's mapping tech set hundreds of years in the future.



The Destiny Planet View website allows web users to explore three of the game's main locations (Earth's Moon, Mars and Venus) via a Google Maps interface. It's the first time a video game has been "mapped" with Google's help. Publisher Activision says:


  "Created using Google Technologies, Destiny Planet View gives fans an immersive first look at Destiny's in-game locations on Mars, Venus and the Moon.  While the experience only reveals a small slice of Destiny's massive worlds, users will be able step through each area and discover useful lore, gameplay tips and even a few hidden real-world and in-game incentives along the way."




This is certainly a different but cool way to promote Destiny, which is released one week from today on September 9 for Sony's PlayStation 3 and 4 and Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. What do you think of this new team up between Google and Bungie?
