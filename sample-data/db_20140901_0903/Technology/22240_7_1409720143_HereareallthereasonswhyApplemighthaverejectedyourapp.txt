					Although the App Store is occasionally subjected to a flood of ridiculous clones, Apple is notorious for its strict guidelines for reviewing apps before they can be put up for sale. It&#8217;s not uncommon for noted app developers with multiple successful releases on the App Store to have to resubmit an update after Apple finds a bug or something objectionable within the app. In order to make the process easier for developers in the future, Apple has added a page to its developer website for the express purpose of letting developers know why their apps are being rejected.The following is a list of the most common issues Apple finds when reviewing apps:Below the explanations for each issue, Apple listed the top 10 reasons that apps were rejected from the App Store from August 22nd &#8211; 28th. The most common reason was that the developers simply didn&#8217;t provide enough information. If a developer doesn&#8217;t explain the app in detail, Apple won&#8217;t waste time reviewing it. Bugs and bad UIs were also near the top of the list.We&#8217;ve known for quite some time that Apple has a relatively high standard for apps it publishes on the App Store, but it&#8217;s nice to finally see all the rules in one place.
