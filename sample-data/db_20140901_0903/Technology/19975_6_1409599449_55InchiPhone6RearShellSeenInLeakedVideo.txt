5.5-Inch iPhone 6 Rear Shell Seen In Leaked Video 5.5-Inch iPhone 6 Rear Shell Seen In Leaked Video Apple has already sent out invites for an event on September 9th so we know when the new iPhones are going to be announced. If you have followed rumors over the past few months you&#8217;ll now that the company is expected to unveil two new iPhone models, both with larger displays. There have also been conflicting reports about the 5.5-inch model, some claim it won&#8217;t ship until next year whereas the 4.7-inch might hit shelves on September 19th. A video has appeared online showing off what&#8217;s claimed to be the rear shell of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6.

At first glance this leaked rear shell doesn&#8217;t look all that different from the countless similar shells of the 4.7-inch model that we have already seen many times. The same cut-out Apple logo, camera and flash orifice is visible. Internal mounting points and the plastic rigging can also be seen.
The shell is measured with a ruler and its length comes in around 160 millimeters. According to the source it&#8217;s possible that Apple might call it the iPhone Air. This moniker has been rumored a few times before as well. Some even claim that it will be called the iPhone 6L.
We don&#8217;t know for sure as yet if both new iPhone models will be released at the same time, but that&#8217;s what happened last year. We&#8217;ll have to wait until September 9th to find out for sure.
