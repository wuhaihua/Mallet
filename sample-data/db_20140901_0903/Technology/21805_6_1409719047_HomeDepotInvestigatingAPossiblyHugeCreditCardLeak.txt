Home Depot Investigating A Possibly Huge Credit Card Leak Home Depot Investigating A Possibly Huge Credit Card Leak 
Many of us might still be reeling from the massive Target hack that saw millions of credit and debit cards being compromised. A luxury retailer was also found to have been hit with a similar breach around the same time.Â It has only been a few months since the dust settled on that fiasco and it looks like another might be in the making. Home Depot has confirmed that it is looking into some &#8220;unusual activity&#8221; and is currently investigating with its banking partners and law enforcement to find out for sure.

According to Brian Krebs, a well known computer security journalist who previously worked for The Washington Post, a &#8220;massive&#8221; pair of credit and debit card batches appeared for sale online on an underground site dedicated to the sale of stolen credit card numbers. He believes that this might be a bigger breach that Target with over 40 million cards being stolen over three weeks.
Reportedly the window of this breach was between May 2014 till August 2014. Home Depot itself has not confirmed if something like this really did happen though its investigating right now. The company says that customers will be notified if ample evidence surfaces that there has been a breach.
As a preemptive measure those who have used a credit or debit card at any of Home Depot&#8217;s 2,200 stores might want to keep an eye on their card activity, while keeping their fingers crossed in the meantime.
