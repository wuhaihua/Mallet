Striped Electrical Tape Makes It Easy To Find The Starting Edge Striped Electrical Tape Makes It Easy To Find The Starting Edge 
How many laps of a roll of tape do you usually need to find the starting edge with your fingernail? Three? Four? You won&#8217;t even need fingernails with with this clever roll of electrical tape that features a wavy double-stripe pattern making the starting edge impossible to miss &#8212; all you need to do is spot the break in the stripes.

Cleverly called &#8216;The End Is in Sight&#8217; these rolls cost just shy of four bucks for a pack of three, which equates to 60m of tape. And this double-stripe technique would seemingly work just as well on masking tape, painter&#8217;s tape, packing tape, even duct tape. Although, for the clear Scotch tape you use to wrap a presents that you want to seem invisible, you&#8217;ll probably want to stick with a dispenser instead.
