Drone Video Shows Apple's Campus In Construction Drone Video Shows Apple's Campus In Construction There’s been a lot of hype about Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ Campus 2, a 2.8 million square-foot collection of buildings that was first proposed back in 2011.
Now, a video captured by a GoPro mounted on a flying drone gives a bird’s-eye view of what’s going on at the construction area, as spotted by 9to5Mac. We got a glimpse of the massive campus via an aerial photo released last month, but the new footage shows how much progress has been made since then, with the foundations of the buildings already laid down.
The city of Cupertino revealed earlier that work only started on the campus in Q2 of this year and is due to continue through the end of Q4 in 2016, although it’s possible that the campus will open before all the buildings are fully completed.
