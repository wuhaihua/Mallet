Gionee Elife S5.1 Be Thinnest Smartphone When It Arrives Gionee Elife S5.1 Be Thinnest Smartphone When It Arrives When it comes to the world of smartphones, these particular devices too, would want to be thinner and thinner &#8211; after all, it follows the general trend where consumer electronics are concerned. Gionee of China already holds the distinction of having the world’s thinnest production smartphone in the form of the Gionee Elife S5.5, and this time around, it looks set to wow the masses with their upcoming device that will be even thinner than the 5.5mm slim predecessor mentioned earlier &#8211; thanks to the introduction of the Gionee Elife S5.1.
Touted to roll out in China later this month, the Gionee Elife S5.1 already carries a &#8220;coming soon&#8221; listing on a retail website that shows just how impossibly thin the handset will be at 5.15mm, running on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. We do wonder how come it does not have Android 4.4 KitKat in tow, as that does seem to be the norm when it comes to modern day devices. 
The Gionee Elife S5.1 is more or less as thin as a regular pencil, and it will feature a 4.8” display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor underneath the hood which will be accompanied by a 2,100mAh battery and 1GB RAM. No idea on pricing details, but I’d dread putting this in the back of my jean’s pocket.
