					We can finally see it now — the light at the end of the tunnel. The seemingly unending flood of leaks and rumors surrounding Apple&#8217;s next-generation iPhone 6 handsets will, in fact, soon come to an end. Apple is scheduled to unveil one or both new iPhone models next week during a big press conference on September 9th and then we can finally move on&#8230; to iPhone 6s rumors. In the meantime, however, we can expect plenty more leaks between now and next Tuesday, the latest of which examines the aluminum housing said to be from Apple&#8217;s upcoming 5.5-inch iPhone phablet.FROM EARLIER: Watch a fully assembled iPhone 6 boot up for the very first timeFrench blog Nowhereelse.fr on Monday published a video in which someone takes a hands-on look at what is claimed to be the rear housing from Apple&#8217;s upcoming larger iPhone model.
