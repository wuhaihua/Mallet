								Anand Lal Shimpi, the founder of hardware reviews website AnandTech.com has announced his retirement in a lengthy letter put up on the site. Shimpi had been the Editor-in-Chief of AnandTech over 17 years and is renowned in the geek world for his in-depth, thoroughly researched stories as well as reviews of  core components such as CPUs, motherboards, solid-state drives, graphics cards and so on.
&nbsp;
According to Recode, Anand Shimpi will most likely join Apple &#8211; a news which was confirmed by an Apple rep. As of now no details are known about the work responsibilities to be under Shimpi. According to 9to5Mac, AnandTech&#8217;s former senior smartphone reviewer had also left the site to join Apple with a focus on building mobile processors for the iOS lineup.
&nbsp;
The website will carry on with Ryan Smith as the new Editor-in-Chief. Anand Shimpi has not given any specific reason for retiring from tech publishing at a young age of 32, but he has mentioned that there are no health or business issues that have motivated the decision.
&nbsp;
Anand Shimpi started the website way back in 1997, and it was called  Anand’s Hardware Tech Page and was hosted on GeoCities. He was just 14-years old at the time and reviewed motherboards. Over the next 17 years, AnandTech has grown into a brand unto itself, and has expanded beyond core components into consumer gadget reviews as well.
&nbsp;
&#8220;Even though I’ve been doing this for nearly 18 years, we’ve evolved with the industry. AnandTech started as a site that primarily reviewed motherboards, then we added CPUs, video cards, cases, notebooks, Macs, smartphones, tablets and anything else that mattered. Our learnings in the PC component space helped us approach mobile the right way, and our learnings in the mobile space have helped us bring the PC enthusiast message to a broader audience than would’ve ever seen it before,&#8221; said Shimpi in his farewell letter.

We wish him the very best with future ventures.
