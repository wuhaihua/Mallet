Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 Badge Revealed Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 Badge Revealed 
News that there would be a high-performance version of the hot new 2015 Ford Mustang called the GT350 came out months ago, and wasn&#8217;t much of aÂ surprise. It would have been a shock if there weren&#8217;t plans to make this car. A good look at the badging that will be on this Mustang, however, is something that we haven&#8217;t had the chance to see until now.


This GT350 emblem was spotted by the folks at Mustang6G on a recent info sheet that provided details on upcoming models of the new Mustang. The sheet showed not just the Mustang GT350 logo, but also the 5.0 badge that is slated to appear on the Mustang GT.

There are a few key takeaways we can get just from this one simple image of the GT350 badge. Notice first that the font chosen to use for the GT350 badge is written in a Shelby-style. Also, that set of blue numbers beneath the badge has its own meaning. They generally use 16098 to indicate what will be a fender emblem.

We don&#8217;t have all the details on the Mustang Shelby GT350 yet, but we at least now know what its badge will look like, and that it will likely appear on the car&#8217;s fenders.
