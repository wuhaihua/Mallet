								Telecom gear maker Nokia has partnered Samsung to provide its maps and location services to Tizen-powered smart devices by the Korean electronics giant.
&nbsp;
The Finnish firm&#8217;s location-based services arm HERE will also provide solutions to Samsung&#8217;s new smartwatch, Gear S.
&nbsp;
Nokia in a statement today said, &#8220;HERE has partnered with Samsung to bring its maps and location platform services to Tizen-powered smart devices by Samsung, including the Samsung Gear S.&#8221;
&nbsp;
On the Samsung Gear S, HERE is powering an application called Navigator, which offers turn-by-turn walk navigation and public transit routing, it added.
&nbsp;
Tizen, an open and flexible OS operating system, was launched as a competitor to Android and iOS operating systems.
&nbsp;
The OS aims to address the needs of all stakeholders of mobile and connected device ecosystem, which includes device manufacturers, mobile operators, application developers and independent software vendors (ISVs).
&nbsp;
Samsung will launch the first smartphone based on its Tizen platform in the July-September quarter this year, a move aimed at reducing dependence on the popular Google&#8217;s Android OS.
&nbsp;
Samsung, the world&#8217;s largest smartphone maker, said the Tizen-powered &#8216;Samsung Z&#8217; will be made available in the third quarter in Russia followed by other markets, Samsung said but did not disclose specific details.
&nbsp;
A majority of Samsung&#8217;s mobile phones are currently powered by the Android platform, which is also the dominant OS on most smartphones across the globe.
&nbsp;
Previously, Samsung ran &#8216;Bada&#8217; OS, which did not see much success. It has since been working on merging the platform with Tizen, which is backed by chipmaker Intel Corp.
&nbsp;
The other popular operating systems include Apple iOS, Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone OS and BlackBerry&#8217;s proprietary platform.
&nbsp;
According to research firm IDC, smartphone sales stood at 281.5 million units globally in Q1 2014, up 28.6% from 218.8 million devices in January-March 2013.
&nbsp;
Samsung had a 30.2% share, while Apple had 15.5% and Huawei had 4.9% share in the said quarter.
