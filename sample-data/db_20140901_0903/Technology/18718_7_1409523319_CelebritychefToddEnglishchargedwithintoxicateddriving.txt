(AP) -- Celebrity chef Todd English, who has opened restaurants around the country and written multiple cookbooks, was arrested Sunday on a charge of driving while intoxicated, authorities said. Police in Southampton said English was arrested Sunday morning on a county road on Long Island. He made a court appearance later in the day, and authorities said he posted $1,500 bail. The circumstances of the arrest were unavailable. An email to English's representative and a call to his attorney were not immediately returned. The chef, whose full name is William Todd English, is the creative force behind a number of restaurants around the country, including Olives, Figs and Fish Club. He also has been a regular on television programs including "Iron Chef USA." English has written several cookbooks and has been honored by the James Beard Foundation for excellence and achievement in cuisine. In September 2009, his former fiancee was charged with assault, and authorities accused her of hitting him with a metal wrist watch, leaving him needing multiple stitches. The couple had been scheduled to get married, but English called the wedding off. A judge in January 2010 closed the case without prison or probation based on her going through anger management and performing community service.
