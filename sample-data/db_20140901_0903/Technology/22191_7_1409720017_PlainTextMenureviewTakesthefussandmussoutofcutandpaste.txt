PlainTextMenu review: Takes the fuss and muss out of cut-and-paste PlainTextMenu review: Takes the fuss and muss out of cut-and-paste 
					

If you spend a lot of time copying and pasting formatted text from the Internet or Microsoft Word, you might just adore PlainTextMenu: It strips out colors, formatting, bold text, and all the pesky things that make sharing or pasting text a pain between programs.


	

PlainTextMenu

Sometimes, of course, it’s the rich text you want; the app offers a trigger so that you can have all text automatically converted or choose when to manually de-decorate your copied text. There are also options to auto-convert to all uppercase letters (if you’re feeling a HULK RAGE coming on), all lowercase (dabble in the poetry of e.e. cummings), or sentence capitalization.

The app has no settings menu, no other flashes, bangs, or whizzes. But it doesn’t really need to: It does what it says on the tin, with a few varied options, and it does it for under a dollar.
