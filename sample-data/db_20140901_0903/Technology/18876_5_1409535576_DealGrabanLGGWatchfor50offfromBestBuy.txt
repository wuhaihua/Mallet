[Deal] Grab an LG G Watch for $50 off from Best Buy [Deal] Grab an LG G Watch for $50 off from Best Buy &nbsp;LG&#8217;s G Watch might be slightly outdated thanks to the G Watch R, but it&#8217;s still a fantastic Android Wear device. Today, Best Buy is shaving a full $50 off the list price of the smartwatch, so you can pick one up for only $179, which definitely isn&#8217;t a bad price for how new it is. The only catch is that you&#8217;ll have to get it shipped to your house, as store pickup isn&#8217;t available right now.Amazon briefly price matched the deal, but it looks like stock has dwindled away so you&#8217;ll only be able to purchase it from third-party sellers if you want to take advantage of any free Prime shipping. The third-party sellers have the device knocked down to about $200, which isn&#8217;t quite as good as Best Buy&#8217;s offering but it&#8217;s still better than full retail.Hit the links below for deal.source: Best BuyAmazon
