Xbox One Asia launch: Everything you need to know Xbox One Asia launch: Everything you need to know  	Microsoft's new console made its debut last year in November in the US and Europe, but the Xbox One has taken its time travelling to Asia. Given the long lead time, many enthusiastic gamers have already plumped for Sony's rival PlayStation 4, which launched in the region in December. 	The long wait for the Xbox One is almost over though -- Microsoft will be launching the console in Hong Kong, India, Taiwan and Singapore on September 23, while for Korea and China, dates have yet to be confirmed. Japan is set for a slightly earlier launch this week, on September 4. 	Price-wise, the Xbox One comes in two versions -- with and without Kinect. Interestingly, in Singapore, the Kinect-free Xbox One is priced the same as the PlayStation 4, though the launch bundle does come with a free game: EA Sports FIFA 15.

Since the Xbox One is region-free, it may be a good deal if you're there on holiday. The Microsoft console is pretty expensive for those living in India, but this is likely due to taxes.Launch titles for Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are similar: Battlefield 4, Crimson Dragon, Dance Central Spotlight, Dead Rising 3: Apocalypse Edition, EA Sports UFC, FIFA 15, Forza Motorsport 5, Halo: Spartan Assault, Call of Duty: Ghosts, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark, Killer Instinct, Kinect Sports Rivals, LocoCycle, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood, Need for Speed Rivals, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, Powerstar Golf, Ryse: Son of Rome, Titanfall, Watch Dogs and Zoo Tycoon.In Korea, launch titles include all of the above games as well as Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. We're checking with Microsoft on which games are available for India and Japan and will update when we hear back.
