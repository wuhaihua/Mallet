Sony SmartWatch 3 and SmartBand Talk to be announced at IFA? Sony SmartWatch 3 and SmartBand Talk to be announced at IFA? We&#8217;ve already told you that Sony is preparing to launch its latest smart watch at IFA in Berlin. What we didn&#8217;t know is that it won&#8217;t be the only wearable device the Japanese company will unveil at that time; joining the SmartWatch 3 will be the SmartBand Talk that will be a simpler device that can track users&#8217; whereabouts throughout the day.
Another new piece of information suggests that the said smart watch will run Google&#8217;s Android Wear platform rather than Sony&#8217;s own custom version of Android. We would think that&#8217;s good news, but we&#8217;re not sure Sony is that eager to dump all the work it invested in previous two SmartWatch models.
Anyhow, this 9to5Google piece claims that the SmartWatch 3 will rock a 1.68-inch 320&#215;320 pixels screen, a built-in heart rate sensor along with an IP58-certified body against dust and water. Yes, this means you&#8217;ll be able to wear one of these while swimming.
As for the SmartBand Talk, it will apparently have some sort of battery-friendly e-ink display that will allow users to carry it around for months before charging it. It is, however, unclear whether the band&#8217;s central piece will be detachable like that was the case with the original SmartBand. We&#8217;ll have all the answers in just a few days, anyway&#8230; Stay tuned&#8230;
