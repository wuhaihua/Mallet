Good Night, Vienna Good Night, Vienna 
Video: I just came from Vienna and I have to admit that I loved it. Part of it was the great company and the other part was the architecture, food, and wine &#8212; the Viennese are such hedonists! This time-lapse video of the imperial city in the style of House of Cards* gives a perfect idea about how cool it is.



* Yes, anything with the House of Cards&#8217; soundtrack looks amazing, but trust me, this city is great.
