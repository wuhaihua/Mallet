The phone measures just 5.1 mm in thickness, excluding some bulge around some of the phone&#8217;s ports. Still, that&#8217;s an impressive feat.Most importantly, the device still features a 2100 mAh battery, so it&#8217;s not going to die in two hours like some other razor thin devices. The S5.1 will be available in a handful of different colors, and China will be the initial launch market for the device.Think we&#8217;ll see any other super thin phones unveiled at IFA?source: CNMOvia: PocketNow
