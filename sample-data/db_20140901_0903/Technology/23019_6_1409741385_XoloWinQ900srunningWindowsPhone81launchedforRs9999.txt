				Xolo's first WP8.1 phone
			
									
								Indian smartphone maker Xolo has launched its first Windows Phone 8.1 device in the market, though it comes later than the expected July schedule. Unsurprisingly, it has nearly identical hardware to the Micromax Canvas Win range, though the price does make it a highly attractive option.

Running Windows Phone 8.1, the Xolo WIN Q900s has been launched for Rs 9,999. The weight of the Win Q900s is certainly the big selling point for this phone, as it is just 100g heavy, making it one of the lightest smartphones around and the lightest Windows Phone device so far. Despite the light weight, the Win Q900s has decent internals, which are quite similar to the Canvas Win W121.

It has a 4.7 inch display with HD (1280×720 pixel) resolution and internally, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor with a clock speed of 1.2 GHz, along with 1GB of RAM, that sounds more than enough for WP8.1 Internally, there’s 8GB of storage, with a standard microSD card slot for expansion up to 32 GB.

On the back, there’s an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash, which won’t unfortunately have Nokia Camera features, and there’s a front facing 2-megapixel shooter too.  Like the Micromax phone, the Xolo Win also supports two SIM cards, along with 3G, Bluetooth 4.0, and Wi-Fi for connectivity.
