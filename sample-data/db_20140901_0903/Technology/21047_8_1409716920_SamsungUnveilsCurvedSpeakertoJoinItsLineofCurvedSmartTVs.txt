Samsung has introduced a curved speaker to complement its 55- and 65-inch curved TVs. 
The HW-H7500 Curved Soundbar lives up to its name by offering a unique, curved slab of audio that can be used as a standalone unit, or serve as a television stand for Samsung's curved TVs. 

Equipped with three drives, enabling it to deliver sound from three different directions, the Soundbar connects to the television wirelessly via Samsung's SoundConnect Bluetooth function. 

However, the device's look and functionality doesn't come cheap â€” the HW-H7500 Curved Soundbar retails for $799.99.
Samsung also rolled out an update to its multi-room speaker ecosystem, which includes the new Shape M3 (WAM350) speaker, as well as the Shape M5 and M7). 

The M3 can be easily integrated into a user's home system, and wirelessly controlled via smartphone or tablet (using Samsung's Wireless Audio Multiroom app). It is also optimized to work with apps such as Spotify, Pandora and Rhapsody. 
We have yet to see how its sound quality stacks up in comparison to similar options, but at just $199.99, the Shape M3 offers an affordable alternative for those setting up large, multi-room audio systems.
