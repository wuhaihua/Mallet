								Electronics giant Samsung said it will offer educational content to school students and aspirant of competitive exams through tablets and smart TVs. Users can download the app from Android Play Store and purchase content for class 1st-12th for CBSE board, priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 4,000.
&nbsp;
&#8220;This is in sync with the Prime Minister&#8217;s vision of inclusive education. Technology can play a big role in the sector. With this launch, we are targetting the over 36 million students in private schools, who can benefit from our solutions,&#8221; Samsung Electronics Director Media Solutions Centre (South West Asia) Tarun Malik told PTI.
&nbsp;
Samsung will start offering content for other boards like ICSE in the coming quarters, he added. &#8220;The content is optimised for tablets and smart TV screens. We will wait to see the response to these and then if need be, we will also bring in solutions for smartphones,&#8221; he said.
&nbsp;
Samsung will pre-embed the app in its Galaxy range of tablets. The Korean firm will also use its retail network to sell SD cards with the content through its network. Asked if the firm would partner schools or focus on individual students, Malik said it would be a mixed approach.
&nbsp;
&#8220;We will target both parents and schools.There would be a mass campaign as well,&#8221; he added.
