Samsung Galaxy Note 4 IFA 2014 poster gets a blurry spotting ahead of 3rd September event Samsung Galaxy Note 4 IFA 2014 poster gets a blurry spotting ahead of 3rd September event IFA 2014 is almost upon us and the usual suspects are looking like they are able to unleash upon the world a whole slew of new and fantastical devices for us to throw our money at. Among the devices, and potentially one of the most anticipated, is the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the latest device in Samsung&#8216;s lineup that it hopes will be a bit more of a success than the Galaxy S5 was. With Samsung&#8217;s September 3rd UNPACKED event just around the corner, it&#8217;s not surprising to see the alleged Samsung Galaxy Note 4 IFA 2014 poster make an appearance, albeit a blurry one.
I&#8217;m not sure how the photo taken, but perhaps the photographer was undercover, hiding in a fish tank. Whatever the case, it does look like this might just be real deal, with the poster claiming the Note 4 has a Quad HD (QHD) display, something we have been suspecting for some time. It also looks like Samsung has done a good job of minimizing the bezels of the device which will help immensely with keeping the device small even with a 5.7-inch display.
