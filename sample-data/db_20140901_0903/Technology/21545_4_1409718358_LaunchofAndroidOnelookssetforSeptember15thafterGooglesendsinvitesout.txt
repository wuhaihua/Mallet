Launch of Android One looks set for September 15th after Google sends invites out Launch of Android One looks set for September 15th after Google sends invites out September looks like it&#8217;s going to be a huge month for the Android world &#8211; with manufacturers lining up to make huge announcements at IFA 2014, you&#8217;d think we&#8217;d be done with announcements for the month. Not so according to an invite sent by Google which states it will have something reveal on September 15th in India. Bets are on among media outlets that this will be the launch of Android One, Google&#8217;s device program for emerging markets, and this would be a perfect time to coordinate an event with its partners, Micromax, Karbonn Mobile and Spice Mobile, among many others.
While the low-powered, low-cost Android One devices won&#8217;t be the most glamorous devices, Google&#8217;s intention is to capitalize on the successes of budget devices like the Motorola Moto E and Moto G which made waves in certain markets. The key of Android One is to share resources between all involved to keep running costs lot and therefore keep the prices of the devices even lower. An example that Google showed at Google I/O was a Micromax device that had a 4.5-inch display, dual-SIM slots, SD card slot and a FM Radio, for which the expected asking price would be less than $100. It seems perhaps inconceivable that the devices could be this cheap, but if anyone can do it, it&#8217;s Google.
