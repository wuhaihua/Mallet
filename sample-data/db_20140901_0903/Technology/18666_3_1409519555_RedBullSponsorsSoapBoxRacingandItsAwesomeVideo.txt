Quick, think of your favorite sporting event. Formula 1? Football? Forget it. This is the Red Bull Formulaz, and it might just be the coolest – and perhaps cheapest – way to get behind the wheel of a race car.
Held on a very, very steep hill in Ardesen, Turkey, competitors don the obligatory Red Bull safety gear and then dive-bomb their handmade soapbox carts down the slope, dodging sandbags, spectators, and each other. The soundtrack alone makes the video worth watching.


Of course, tiny wooden wheels don’t exactly provide excellent grip as well as steering by tiller so there might be a crash or two. Maybe. Best of all, a man wielding a giant whip starts each six-car heat, which is frankly brilliant and begs the question – why isn’t that motorsport’s universal starting protocol?
