Here’s another way the iPhone 6 might disappoint you Here’s another way the iPhone 6 might disappoint you 
					We hope you weren&#8217;t getting your hopes up too much that Apple was going to just give you a cool new reversible USB cable when you bought the iPhone 6. 9to5Mac directs our attention to a new research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who says that Apple&#8217;s new reversible USB Lightning connector won&#8217;t be shipping with the iPhone 6 and it&#8217;s not clear whether Apple plans to release the new connector at all. Kuo says that Apple believes the reversible USB connector will offer only &#8220;limited improvements to overall user experience&#8221; and thus won&#8217;t be worth the extra money to ship with the iPhone 6.FROM EARLIER: The most disappointing rumor about the iPhone 6 may have just been confirmedReversible USB cables solve the annoying problems that arise when you damage your hardware by trying to jam a USB cable into your computer the wrong way. The way the new cables are designed, you’ll now be able to safely plug them in on either side without having to worry about hurting your computer’s USB port.The USB 3.0 Promoter Group only just last week finalized its work on the USB Type-C connector that promises to be fully reversible so it would be pretty fast turnaround for Apple to come out with its own reversible USB cable so quickly, although we don’t know for sure yet whether Apple’s reversible USB cables will use USB 3.0’s standards.We&#8217;re pretty sure that a reversible USB Lightning connector is coming at some point, although for now we wouldn&#8217;t put any money on it coming with the iPhone 6.
