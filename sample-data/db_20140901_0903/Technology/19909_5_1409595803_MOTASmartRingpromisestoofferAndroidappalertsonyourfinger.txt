The smartwatch or smartband is apparently old hat to a company called MOTA, which announced today an upcoming product called the MOTA SmartRing, which it says will provide mobile app notifications on a device that can fit on a finger.



The SmartRing can offer alerts for text messages, incoming calls, calendar alerts and more. MOTA says:


  "Users decide for themselves exactly who they want to talk with and which events they wish to be updated about. The SmartRing displays notifications in text form, with users able scroll through words at the speed they wish. The SmartRing provides maximum discretion over notifications, letting the wearer enable and disable audible and tactile alerts."


The SmartRing will have an Android and iPhone app that will link smartphones to the ring, so it will work with services such as Facebook and Twitter. The MOTA SmartRing is supposed to be released in North America sometime in the fourth quarter of 2014 but pricing has yet to be announced. MOTA will show off the SmartRing at this week's IFA event in Berlin.
