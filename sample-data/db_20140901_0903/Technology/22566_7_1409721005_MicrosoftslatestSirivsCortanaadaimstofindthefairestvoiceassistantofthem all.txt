        Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? That's the question Microsoft is trying to answer with its latest Windows Phone commercial. The software maker pitted Cortana against Siri in July, and now a new ad sees the pair square off against each other once again. It starts with Siri "feeling pretty, oh so pretty" while staring into a mirror, before Cortana appears with Jen Taylor's unmistakable voice to subtly mock Apple's robotic tone.
HTC's One M8 for Windows is the star of the show as it spins around to show off its aluminum body, and the front-facing BoomSound speakers are compared directly, with a touch of humor, to the single speaker at the bottom of the iPhone 5S. These types of comparisons aren't new for Microsoft as the company has used Siri to compare iPads to Windows 8 tablets. Microsoft also reignited the Mac vs. PC conflict last month with a new Surface Pro 3 ad that saw its latest tablet go head-to-head with the MacBook Air.
