Watch Footage Of Iceland's Ongoing Volcanic Eruption Watch Footage Of Iceland's Ongoing Volcanic Eruption Lava started spewing forth Sunday morning from the same fissure in between Iceland’s Askja and Bardarbunga volcanoes where a smaller eruption was observed earlier this week. Iceland’s Meteorological Office reports as of 7 a.m. local time that “the lava flow was around 1 km wide and 3 km long towards northeast. The thickness was estimated a few meters, the flow about 1000 m3&nbsp;per second.” 
Scientists on site from the University of Cambridge captured this footage from the eruption. The University of Iceland says that the highest fire fountains seen are about 70 meters high.
	
								 
 
The new eruption prompted the authorities in Iceland to briefly raise the alert for air travel to red, but within a few hours when it was determined that the eruption was not producing any threatening ash in the atmosphere, the restricted flight area around the area was cancelled. As of this writing, no flight restrictions are in effect and airports are open in Iceland. 
I’m continuing to update this developing story. Keep checking back for new information and images.
