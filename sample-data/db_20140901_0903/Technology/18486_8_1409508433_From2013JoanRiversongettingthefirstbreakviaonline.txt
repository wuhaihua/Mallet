				Joan Rivers Talks Her Devices | Talking Your Tech
			LOS ANGELES - Comedian Joan Rivers remains in serious condition at a New York hospital, in a medically-induced coma, as fans around the world wish her the best. Meanwhile, with Rivers on so many of our minds, we thought we'd reach into the #TalkingTech vault, to rewind our sit-down with the comedian from 2013.We met on April 2, 2013, at daughter Melissa's home, where Rivers was plugging her new online series, In Bed with Joan. Rivers, who was just about to turn 80, had just arrived from New York at the noon hour, for our interview and tapings at the E! Entertainment Television network. She had a complete list of tech topics jotted on a piece of paper to refer to for our interview, and as always, was a whole lot of fun to chat with.
