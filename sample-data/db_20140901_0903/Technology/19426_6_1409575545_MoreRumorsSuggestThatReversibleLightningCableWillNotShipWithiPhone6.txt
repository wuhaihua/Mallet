More Rumors Suggest That Reversible Lightning Cable Will Not Ship With iPhone 6 More Rumors Suggest That Reversible Lightning Cable Will Not Ship With iPhone 6 We have been hearing rumors that Apple has plans for a reversible USB Lightning cable that is expected to make its debut with the iPhone 6. In some ways this doesn’t really come as a surprise given that Apple has patents for such a design in the past, although recent rumors seem to suggest that the accessory might not be making its debut with the iPhone 6.
This is according to a new note from KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo (via AppleInsider) who notes that he doesn’t expect Apple to ship the new cable with the iPhone 6. He claims that the reason for this is apparently due to cost concerns as well as &#8220;limited improvements to overall user experience&#8221;.
Kuo’s note seems to corroborate with an earlier report that revealed that one of Apple’s manufacturing partners had sent Apple some samples but the Cupertino company had yet to move forward by placing an order. This suggested that Apple could either be rethinking the design or could be delaying it for a later release.
In any case there seems to be third-party reversible USB Lightning cables in the market already and with Apple’s event kicking off next week on the 9th of September, we guess we will find out all the official details then.
