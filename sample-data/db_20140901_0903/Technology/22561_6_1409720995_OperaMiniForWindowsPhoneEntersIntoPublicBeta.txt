Opera Mini For Windows Phone Enters Into Public Beta Opera Mini For Windows Phone Enters Into Public Beta When it comes to mobile browsers, there are plenty that users can choose from. They can choose to use the default browsers installed on their phones, or they can go with third-party alternatives if they feel that it can get the job done better or if there are features in these browsers that they can’t live without.
The good news for Windows Phone users, who might have been a little jealous of their iOS and Android friends, is that if you were looking forward to getting your hands on Opera Mini, you will soon be able to. In fact Opera has announced that they are currently looking for beta testers to take part in the beta of the software.
For those who are interested in taking part in the beta, all you will need to do is head on over to the Opera website and leave your email address, after which you should receive instructions on how to proceed. It looks like the beta is a public beta so you should be able to get in just fine.
If you’re waiting for a more stable and final release, unfortunately Opera did not mention when the app is expected to go out of beta, but hopefully it won’t take too long. In any case if you’re a Windows Phone user looking for a new browser experience, why not take Opera Mini for a spin?
