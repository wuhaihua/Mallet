Girl Dancing With 30 Hula Hoops Looks Like She's About To Get Teleported Girl Dancing With 30 Hula Hoops Looks Like She's About To Get Teleported 
Video: Coral Jade is a street performer that&#8217;s pretty much mastered the art of hula hooping. She can twirl them on every part of her body, use them to create mind bending warps and dance with 30 to make it look like she&#8217;s being teleported in a JJ Abrams-era Star Trek Transporter.

And hey, there&#8217;s even a lens flare.
