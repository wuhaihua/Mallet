What started out as a name brand in China and select Asian locales has slowly grown to Europe, North America and a few other areas of the world. Not all regions received the same device options, but the fact they were available at all was a good step. Here in the states the Oppo Find 7 was the big talk of the town for a while. Now our friends in Australia have the ability to order up one of the Oppo devices directly from Oppo.


“At OPPO we’re focused on innovation and are passionate about exploring the latest that technology has to offer, while providing our consumers with high-quality, state of the art devices.
