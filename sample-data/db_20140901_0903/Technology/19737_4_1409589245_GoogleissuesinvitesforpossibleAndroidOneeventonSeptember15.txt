Image: Android Authority.Google has begun issuing invitations for a September 15 event in India where it is expected to announced the first crop of Android One devices built specifically for emerging markets. The handsets are expected to go on sale next month, with prices starting at just $100.First announced at Google I/O back in June, the Android One program is designed to provide capable Android-powered devices at affordable price tags for emerging markets. What makes them different to affordable Android handsets from companies like Samsung and HTC is that the software will be handled by Google.That means users will get pure Android for a smoother experience, and much more timely updates. They will also get Android L upgrades when the new software becomes available this fall, while lots of entry-level rivals from other manufacturers will not.Android One devices are expected to come with budget quad-core processors, 1GB of RAM, a microSD card slot, and displays around 4.3 to 4.5 inches in size. Some will also include dual SIM card slots and a built-in FM radio, features that are popular among cellphone users in markets throughout Asia.Some of the manufacturers Google has partnered with for Android One include Micromax, Karbonn Mobiles, and Spice, which has already promised its first Android One device would be available this October.
