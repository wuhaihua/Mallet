The Sisu Social: Can Finns Teach The World To Hang Tough? The Sisu Social: Can Finns Teach The World To Hang Tough? How many mainland Americans, as children, learn that the Eskimos have more words for snow than we – mere mortals — can even imagine?&nbsp; As a boy growing up in sixties in New York, I was exposed to more words for venting, complaining, and otherwise toughing out life’s many indignities.&nbsp; The language was New York street Yiddish, from which I learned to&nbsp;kvetch&nbsp;when I am wont,&nbsp;schlep&nbsp;when I must, and turn on the&nbsp;chutzpah,&nbsp;when appropriate.&nbsp; Like the old ad from that era said,&nbsp;you don’t need to be Jewish to love rye bread.&nbsp; And you don’t need to be a member of the tribe – I am Puerto Rican, with some uncertain Jewish ancestry — to benefit from its basic cultural strengths. 
Recently, I was reminded of my New York crypto-Jewish youth when hearing about Emilia Lahti, a social scientist who’s helping to introduce another cultural construct:&nbsp; sisu (pronounced – si-su).&nbsp; No, it’s not Yiddish – Ms. Lahti hails from Helsinki – but if she has her way, you’ll soon be hearing people say it — and even try to&nbsp;practice&nbsp;it – all around the world.
	
								 
The construct – which many say is untranslatable (more about that, later)– is as much a part of Finnish identity as chutzpah is to New York identity.&nbsp; If you had to translate it crudely, it would be “guts.”&nbsp; Or if you had to translate it technically for professional audiences (the folks that Lahti speaks with), it would be more like, “determination and resoluteness in the face of extreme adversity.”&nbsp; Lahti&nbsp; — a recent graduate of University of Pennsylvania’s masters program in applied positive psychology, and now a PhD student at Finland’s Aalto University – is emerging as one the world’s foremost authorities on sisu, helping to articulate it, to measure it, and, most important, to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;it. 
The social construction of sisu
								
										 
For several reasons, Lahti’s timing for this cultural adventure feels right.&nbsp; As many of you know, I work in the field of social engagement, which asks organizations to look at not just the technology that’s shaping communication today, but the social forces behind the technology.&nbsp; Sisu, which historians trace back to Finnish lore over five hundred years back, has been defined and shaped by people with the means to create stories and narrative.&nbsp; It has been used, for example, by popular media to help explain how the Finns were able to fight back the Soviets during the&nbsp;Winter War.&nbsp; It’s been used by journalists to explain the fortitude of Finnish athletes –&nbsp;e.g., the famous Finnish runners, Paavo Nurmi and Lasse Viren –&nbsp;in international competition.&nbsp; It’s even been used by Finnish brands, including Leaf International, whose Sisu licorice pastilles may in fact require – depending on your palette – &nbsp;determination in the face of extreme adversity. 
Which is not to say that the Finnish people themselves do not own the term – they have and they do – but the democratizing forces that are shaping communication today are helping to personalize sisu in many more ways.&nbsp; I recently heard the story of another Finn on the Positive Psychology Facebook Group (30K+ members).&nbsp; About 20 years ago,&nbsp;Kati van der Hoeven, a former Finnish supermodel, lost her ability to move and speak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that time, she has emerged as a leading advocate for people with Locked-In Syndrome and other conditions using an eye-to-computer system to manage her writing.&nbsp; For this story, I communicated with Kati via Facebook Messenger, marveling the speed with which she is able to correspond.&nbsp; Is it the Finn in Kati, or something else?&nbsp; Not sure, but I think I got a better understanding – and&nbsp;appreciation&nbsp;– of sisu. 
The internal applications 
But one of the interesting things about social constructs is that –&nbsp;like the future&nbsp;– they are not evenly distributed.&nbsp; Of course, not all Finns can claim to have sisu, just as not all New Yorkers can claim to have chutzpah (despite what TV would have you believe).&nbsp; The opportunity for the sisu social – the personalization of sisu to create a longtail of stories that might inspire – starts at home.
										
										 
While researching this story, I learned how Finland has not been immune to the European pandemic of obesity.&nbsp; It got my attention.&nbsp; Earlier this summer, my firm was hired by a consumer company to study the underlying causes of the epidemic.&nbsp; It’s not just about eating habits, but physical exercise as well, which today must compete mass media, video games, and mobile apps.&nbsp; But to reach youth, a top-down approach for teaching sisu will not work.&nbsp; As anti-smoking and anti-drug campaigns in the US have shown,&nbsp;Just Say No&nbsp;can be non-starter.&nbsp; A better approach would be to support the education of peer leaders, and help spread the longtail of stories that are personally relevant. 
The external applications&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
And that, to me, is the power of the sisu social.&nbsp; But the applications are not limited to the Finnish people.&nbsp; There’s an opportunity – as Lahti agreed in a recent conversation – to share the construct with the rest of the world.&nbsp; She’s looking to see how this special brand of determination can be taught to help people with trauma.&nbsp; And she’s also looking to see how sisu can help prepare people before trauma occurs (with high-risk populations), a preventative approach consistent with the pro-active bias in positive psychology.&nbsp; But there’s yet another external application that interests me:&nbsp; using sisu as a tool of citizen diplomacy, enabling Finns around the world – many who already are highly active on social networks – gain influence in the world by helping others.&nbsp; It’s an approach that’s consistent with the notion of positive&nbsp;peace.&nbsp; If Lahti can get the sisu social right, other social constructs – like the&nbsp;hygge&nbsp;of the Danes, the&nbsp;gemutlichkeit&nbsp;of the Germans, the&nbsp;lagom&nbsp;of the Swedish, the&nbsp;ganbaru&nbsp;of the Japanese,&nbsp;the stiff upper lip&nbsp;of the British, and the&nbsp;sumud&nbsp;of the Palestinians – might follow. 
The world is a living laboratory for positive social constructs developed to respond to culturally specific challenges. But translate the untranslatable and we will prepare people in the world to speak and learn from one another. &nbsp;Power to the sisu social, and to all the Finns — the tough and not-so-tough — who are taking part.
