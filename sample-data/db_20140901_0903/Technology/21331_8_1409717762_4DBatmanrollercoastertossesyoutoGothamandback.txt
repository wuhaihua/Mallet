Batman: The Ride is among the world's first "4D free-fly roller coasters," where riders' seats spin around independently of how/where the car is headed. Riders of Batman: The Ride will be flipped around at least six times, and the track itself features greater-than-90-degree drops to make sure their stomachs will be tied in knots. Just watching the concept video of riders flipping around as the car makes its way along the track is enough to make the weak-stomached a bit uneasy.  Batman: The Ride might just be the ride for for adventure-seekers with iron-clad stomachs looking for the next thrill. Batman: The Ride is set to open in the summer of 2015 at Six Flags Fiesta Texas, and it could be just the thing to turn Sad Batman's frown upside-down.Batman: The Ride will let you glide through the air like the Caped Crusader, if you can stomach it.(Via Gizmodo)
