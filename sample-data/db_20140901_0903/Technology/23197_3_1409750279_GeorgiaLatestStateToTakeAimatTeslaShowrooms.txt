Georgia Latest State To Take Aim at Tesla Showrooms Georgia Latest State To Take Aim at Tesla Showrooms 
It looks like the latest state to take issue with Tesla&#8217;s showrooms is Georgia. According to a report in Automotive News, the Georgia Automotive Dealers Association filed a petition on Friday to contest a showroom in the Atlanta area.

This time, the complaint doesn&#8217;t stem purely from Tesla selling directly to consumers through its showrooms rather than using the traditional dealership model. The petition instead takes issue with how it applied for an exemption to the state law that enforces that model. They say that the showroom was approved under an exemption for specialty automakers that produce less than 150 vehicles. Clearly, Tesla does not fit within those parameters.

The store in question is located just outside of Atlanta in the suburb of Marietta. The company has plans to open two more showrooms in the Atlanta area, assuming the courts don&#8217;t have other plans.
Georgia is just the latest in a growing list of states where dealers have fought the showroom model. Pennsylvania and New York both took issue with Tesla, but the automaker was allowed to remain in those states only with a cap on the number of locations it would open.


Given that Georgia is the second largest market for electric vehicles, behind only San Francisco, it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll be fighting hard for some kind of compromise that allows them to remain in the state.
