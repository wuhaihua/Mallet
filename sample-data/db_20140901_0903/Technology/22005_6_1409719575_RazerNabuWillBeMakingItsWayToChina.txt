Razer Nabu Will Be Making Its Way To China Razer Nabu Will Be Making Its Way To China Earlier this year at CES 2014, Razer announced their first wearable which comes in the form of the Razer Nabu. The Nabu is not a smartwatch and appears to be more of a band, and perhaps to capitalize on China’s growing economy and the demand for wearables, Razer has recently announced that they will be bringing the Nabu over to China.
This will be a collaborative effort between Razer and a handful of companies, such as Tencent, Tencent Games, JD.com, Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts, and FISE World. The Razer Nabu is expected to be made available in Q4 2014 this year, so if you’ve had your eye on the device, you can expect to get your hands on one later this year.
For those unfamiliar with the Nabu because you missed its announcement earlier this year, it is a smart band that can be worn around your wrist. It comes with a small display that will be able to show users information such as emails, calls, text messages, and notifications in general.
The Nabu for China is expected to come integrated with a couple of apps, such as WeChat where users can exchange contact information with another person wearing a Nabu just by “high fiving” them. Another app would be the Timi Run Everyday app, which is basically a fitness app that converts the amount of steps walked, calories burnt, and etc., into in-game rewards.
Pricing of the Razer Nabu has yet to be determined but we’ll keep our eyes peeled for more info.
