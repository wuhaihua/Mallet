Acer Unveils New Aspire Switch 11 & 10 2-in-1 Notebooks Acer Unveils New Aspire Switch 11 & 10 2-in-1 Notebooks It wasn’t too long ago that customers who wanted a tablet and a laptop would have to resort to buying separate devices. Nowadays we guess there are still users out there who prefer to use separate devices, but if you’re the sort that would prefer using only one device out of convenience, then Acer’s 2-in-1 notebooks could be what the doctor ordered.
The company has recently taken the wraps off their new Acer Aspire Switch 11 series and expanded their Switch 10 series with a newer model.
Starting with the Aspire Switch 11, these are new 2-in-1 notebooks that will come with 11.6-inch displays. There are two models in this range &#8211; the SW5-171 and the SW5-111. The former will be a slightly higher-end model with an Intel Core i5 processor under the hood. It will also pack a Full HD display and a 128GB SATA hard drive for storage. It will also be accompanied by 4GB of RAM and will support a variety of peripherals via USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports.
The SW5-111 will be a slightly lower-end model. It will feature a lower resolution of 1366 x 768 and will be powered by an Intel Atom Z3745 processor. It will come with 2GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. There will also be two USB 2.0 ports &#8211; one normal and one micro, and a 2MP front-facing camera that can be used for video calls. However despite the differences in hardware, both models will feature Gorilla Glass 3 screens, front-facing stereo speakers, and a chiclet-style keyboard.
Last but not least is the Acer Aspire Switch 10. This model will join the existing models and users will be able to choose between a Full HD display or a 1280&#215;800 display, although both models will come with a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen. Both models will also be powered by an Intel Atom quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM and a battery life that Acer boasts should last up to 7-8 hours, depending on the resolution you chose. It will also come preloaded with Microsoft Office 365 Personal and Windows 8.1.
The Acer Aspire Switch 11 notebooks will be available in October where it will be priced starting from $399. The Acer Aspire Switch 10 on the other hand will be available in September and will be priced starting from $329.99.
