(PR) Logitech Unveils Keyboard Designed For Your Computer, Smartphone and Tablet (PR) Logitech Unveils Keyboard Designed For Your Computer, Smartphone and Tablet Today Logitech unveiled the Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480, the first desk keyboard designed for use with up to three devices, regardless of computing platform. Now you can type a report on your computer and, with the flick of the Easy-Switch dial, respond to a message on your smartphone and type a tweet on your tablet. The universal keyboard can connect to three different Bluetooth wireless devices at once, whether you are using a Windows, Mac or Chrome OS computer, or an Android or iOS tablet or smartphone.

"Typing needs have evolved and consumers are computing and texting across multiple screens, often using two or three different operating systems," said Charlotte Johs, global vice president of computer peripherals at Logitech. "The Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480 makes it simple for people to work, create or communicate quickly and comfortably, no matter what computing device or platform they are using." 
You can type in comfort on a full-size desk keyboard with a familiar layout and all the shortcut keys you use the most. The durable, integrated stand firmly holds your phone or tablet at just the right angle for you to read while you type. With a choice of two color schemes, the keyboard is designed to blend into your home decor without sacrificing style.

Pricing and Availability
The Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480 is expected to be available in the U.S. and Europe beginning in September 2014, for a suggested retail price of $49.99.
