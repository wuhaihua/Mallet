(PR) NZXT Introduces its New Source 340 Case (PR) NZXT Introduces its New Source 340 Case Forged from strong, cold-­‐rolled steel, the S340 exudes an air of confidence that only the most durable of cases is capable of exhibiting. Axing the optical bays and relocating the HDDs to a lower position opens the case up like never before, making this one of the easiest cases to build in ever. A grommet-­‐less cable management solution, alongside over twenty zip-­‐tie locations and plenty of space behind the motherboard tray gives you unprecedented cable management options for a mid tower case.

When it comes to keeping cool, the Source 340 is no slouch. With Kraken X61 compatibility in the front intake, X31 compatibility in the rear exhaust, and a total of up to three 140 mm or for 120 mm fans you have plenty of chilling options. Thick front panel cutouts allow unrestricted airflow to reach our fully filtered intake. The Source 340 comes with the standard accouterments that you would expect from a premium case, such as USB 3.0, filtered intakes, a PSU shroud, and quality materials. Easily one of the most durable cases we've ever made, the Source 340 boasts 360 degrees of steel casing, extremely minimal plastic use, and extra thick side panels.     
The extremely compact mid tower form factor sits significantly further shorter length-­‐wise to allow you to fit the case into harder to fit areas and carry the case around much easier without sacrificing performance. The S340 is everything a new builder, an experienced modder, or any PC enthusiast needs without the distraction of bright lights or flashy paneling.
