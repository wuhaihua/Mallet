        			Dish Network's anticipated Internet TV service may be called Nutv, if a trademark from the company that recently surfaced is any indication. This wouldn't be entirely surprising, since the company has dabbled with the name in the past, but it has made a small refinement that makes it a bit more consumer-friendly.Back in 2013, Dish Network previously trademarked the term Nütv, which it later tossed aside for the new trademark, which eschews the umlaut that consumers weren't likely to properly type out anyway. Amongst the services listed as associated with the trademark are categories like "transmission of audio, video, subscription television, and video-on-demand content via the Internet..."The logo -- featured above -- was revealed in the trademark filing, which (as GigaOm points out) might hint at the service type associated with it via the horizontal bar in much the same way the Dish logo shows satellite signals. Of course, nothing guarantees this is the upcoming service's logo, so take it all with a grain of salt.It was originally believed the service would be launching this summer, but that launch date has been pushed back towards the end of the year. Back in March, Bloomberg reported on pricing information it acquired from unnamed sources. According to those sources, the Internet TV subscription could be priced between $20 and $30 per month, though obviously that could change.SOURCE: GigaOm
