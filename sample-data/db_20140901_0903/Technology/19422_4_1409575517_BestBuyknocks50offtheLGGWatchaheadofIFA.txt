Best Buy knocks $50 off the LG G Watch ahead of IFA Best Buy knocks $50 off the LG G Watch ahead of IFA Best Buy has kicked off its LG G Watch reductions early following the announcement of the G Watch R last week. The Android Wear watch can now be had for just $179.99 — $50 less than its original retail price.With the G Watch R coming later this year and other smartwatches expected at IFA this week, interest in the first Android Wear watches is going to wane pretty quickly over the coming months. It seemed inevitable, then, that retailers would begin discounting the original Android Wear lineup sooner rather than later.And Best Buy has become one of the first to offer a fairly sizable reduction on the G Watch — the device that&#8217;s probably most likely to suffer when new competition comes along, given its shortcomings in battery life and display quality — and of course the well-documented issues with its charging connectors.Both the black and white G Watch variants are reduced to $179.99 right now, and they are available with free shipping. Best Buy is currently promising to ship within one business day, and the offer appears to be available online only — not in store.It&#8217;s unclear how long this reduction will be available, so if you&#8217;re interested in a G Watch regardless of what&#8217;s coming later this year, then you may want to take advantage of this deal while you still can.
