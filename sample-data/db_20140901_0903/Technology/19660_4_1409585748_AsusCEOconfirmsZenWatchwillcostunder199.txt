This suggests the device will be available in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries at launch.Asus hasn&#8217;t actually confirmed the ZenWatch&#8217;s price tag, but Shen does say it will cost less than $199, making it $30 cheaper than the LG G Watch, and the same price as the Samsung Gear Live. Asus has also promised that the device will be more attractive than existing competitors.Asus will officially announce the ZenWatch at IFA in Berlin later this week, and we&#8217;ll bring you that news as soon as it breaks.
