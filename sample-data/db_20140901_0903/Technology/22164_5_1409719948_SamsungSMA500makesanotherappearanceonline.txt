Samsung SM-A500 makes another appearance online Samsung SM-A500 makes another appearance online A few days ago the Samsung SM-A500 turned up on the Bluetooth SIG web site after getting its certification from that group. The device is part of a new series of phones from Samsung based on the Samsung Galaxy Alpha. A new sighting of the device on the GFXBench site gives us much more information about the SM-A500. According to the information on GFXBench, the SM-A500 will have a 4.8-inch screen running at 1280 x 720 resolution. That is slightly larger than the Galaxy Alpha&#8217;s 4.7-inch screen. The smartphone appears to be driven by a Snapgradon 410 processor running at 1.19 GHz. This is not the most powerful of processors, but it does come with support for 64-bit computing, so it should be able to tap into the benefits of Android L.The SM-A500 as tested was equipped with 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal memory. The rear-facing camera is listed as a 12 MP unit while the front-facing camera is a 4.7 MP shooter.Expect to see more of this device leak over the coming weeks, along with siblings SM-A300 and SM-A700.source: GFXBench
