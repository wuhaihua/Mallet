Dell CIO Andi Karaboutis Helps Dell Put The Customer First Dell CIO Andi Karaboutis Helps Dell Put The Customer First Much has been written about the benefits and risks of the rise of prominence of the CMO to the CIO. &nbsp;Some have pontificated that it will mean the death of or at least the diminution of influence of the CIO, as CMOs have more authority over technology. Dell Global CIO Andi Karaboutis scratches her head at this notion. She describes Dell’s strategy to put the customer first, and the role that each functional and business unit head must bring in order to realize that vision. It means that IT must shape its unique perspective and apply its unique lens to opportunities and issues. It also means that emerging leaders in IT work in other regions and functions to round out their perspectives on Dell’s business to be able to contribute more value to IT, a practice she learned from a successful tenure in the automotive industry. It also requires IT to have an R&amp;D and innovation role, constantly monitoring trends to choose the best ones to bring to life the needs of Dell and of Dell’s customers. Lastly, it means spending time with external customers, as IT must have a role in developing value for them.

Peter High:&nbsp;Andi, Dell has been&nbsp;going through quite a transformation in recent months, not the least of which was the organization going private after having been a public company for some time.&nbsp;I wonder, in your time as global&nbsp;CIO&nbsp;how these changes have manifested themselves in the IT department, if at all. 
Andi Karaboutis:&nbsp;One of the things that Michael Dell says&nbsp;-&nbsp;and we’ve all held very strongly to his strategy at Dell&nbsp;-&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;our focus&nbsp;is&nbsp;on continuing to be a world-class end-to-end solutions company. Similarly, the strategy&nbsp;and goals&nbsp;of IT and our focus continue to be the same, which is:&nbsp;the customer is at the center of everything that we do and developing our roadmaps,&nbsp;plans, strategies,&nbsp;and instrumentation of disruptive technology around that, continues to be core.
								
										 
I think the big difference is the intensified focus and speed with which we’re actually pursuing those goals and objectives. Obviously as a public company you have different and added burdens&nbsp;around Wall Street, quarterly earnings, focus on sales in shorter time periods, whereas as a private company our focus is on short, medium, and longer term methods and objectives of how we want to execute things.&nbsp;So it just lets us be that much more intense&nbsp;around our strategy. 
High:&nbsp;Dell has determined to become more&nbsp;of a solutions-based business.&nbsp;I was wondering if that also has&nbsp;any bearing on how you manage IT or how you support this change within the rest of this organization. 
Karaboutis:&nbsp;Absolutely. We went from being a hugely successful hardware center company&nbsp;-&nbsp;through 19 acquisitions in a very short period of time, and probably 25 or more acquisitions over four or five years- to&nbsp;becoming an end-to-end solutions company where we provide not just&nbsp;client&nbsp;appliance hardware but enterprise services and software&nbsp;as&nbsp;well, which makes up that continuum of the end-to-end solution.&nbsp;What that’s done internally for Dell IT is&nbsp;provide it&nbsp;some new capabilities and a new rhythm to which we’ve had to operate in order to bring to bear functionality we never needed before.Two examples are digital fulfillment and &nbsp;recurring billing. These capabilities had become necessary with our new focus.&nbsp;We’ve had to step back, take a look at all the capabilities that we have from a design, market, sell, build,&nbsp;and&nbsp;fulfill perspective.&nbsp;With&nbsp;the new end-to-end solutions menu, what are the new capabilities that are needed around that?&nbsp;That’s been the change in the “what”. The change in the “how” has been faster, more intense,&nbsp;with the customer at the center and using as much of the disruptive technologies as we possibly can.&nbsp;Even as a tech company we’re obviously&nbsp;very&nbsp;focused on making sure that we’re socially minded:&nbsp;Mobile, analytics, cloud, strategy for&nbsp;internet of&nbsp;things, and the rest of the disruptive technologies in play. 
High:&nbsp;You are an IT executive&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sea&nbsp;of IT experts.&nbsp;You are leveraging a lot of important business and IT trends that are on the minds of so many IT executives.&nbsp;A&nbsp;difference, relative to a lot of&nbsp;your&nbsp;peers and,&nbsp;in fact,&nbsp;even relative to your past experiences in organizations that were not really quite as tech-centric, in the case of Dell, the business is technology.&nbsp;How does your role and your team’s role fit into that of the many engineers of the organization, as you were thinking of leveraging trends and translating them back into the needs that they’re articulating?
										
										 
Karaboutis:&nbsp;Being a CIO in a tech company is an absolute blast, Peter.&nbsp; It’s hugely important that we do what I call “drink our own champagne”, or Dell-on-Dell.&nbsp;So each and every product that we offer where we can show that it scales to a large enterprise customer, like&nbsp;ourselves, is a reference for our salespeople and for other CIOs to see. When I was in the auto industry I drove all the vehicles but I wasn’t necessarily the organization that provided core feedback into things that should change, scale,&nbsp;etc. 
Secondly, we worked very closely with our product development teams to say “Hey, we have&nbsp;use cases here that might not have been thought of for large scale enterprises, but designed more toward a midpoint or a small business.”&nbsp;So we provide that feedback in an adaptive loop that helps develop our products even more.&nbsp;Then obviously, we meet externally with CIOs.&nbsp;A lot of CIOs want to hear “Are you using your own product?&nbsp;How did you put it in? What were the lessons learned?” So we provide that data. 
The other really fun and interesting point about being the CIO in a tech company is&nbsp;that we’ve&nbsp;developed an incubation team within IT that goes and really seeks emerging technologies. For example, we have developed liaisons with some of the partners that we have, and have implemented things that become new sales opportunities.&nbsp;An example&nbsp;is our&nbsp;great partnership with Google around the&nbsp;Google Appliance.&nbsp;We just launched Google Search internally, took down all the traditional websites that employees navigate through to get to information, and we fully implemented Google Search.&nbsp;That was in the spirit of the consumer experience, partnering with a company that we’re selling together with, going to market with, and also showing innovation and great entrepreneurial spirit internally.&nbsp;It is very exciting to be the CIO of a tech company, especially at Dell. 
High:&nbsp;What’s&nbsp;also&nbsp;apparent is the degree to which yours is a function that&nbsp;is externally facing, in addition to&nbsp;being&nbsp;internally facing.&nbsp;Historically the Chief Information Officer&nbsp;has been primarily an internal role.&nbsp;It seems very apparent that one of the advantages of the Dell-on-Dell strategy is that you can be an advocate to your peers and talk about the way in which you have used what&nbsp;you would hope that they would think about using as well, as they are purchasing Dell’s services&nbsp;and solutions.&nbsp;As you’ve thought about the implications of that with the rest of your team,&nbsp;have you&nbsp;had to ensure that your reports and the broader team&nbsp;have&nbsp;a clear cognizance of the needs of end customers&nbsp;than&nbsp;perhaps historically the Chief Information or IT role would have? 
Karaboutis:&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp;That’s the case for two reasons.&nbsp;One, because of what we’re talking about here where we’re externally facing; we&nbsp;talk to customers.&nbsp;We’ve done over 500+ briefings with various companies around our Dell-on-Dell story and implementation.&nbsp;The other reason is a lot of the work that we’re doing with Karen&nbsp;Quintos, our Chief Marketing Officer, around putting the customer at the center of everything, and how we expedite gaining insights at the speed of the customer,&nbsp;not the speed of IT.&nbsp;That kind of recognition is also a different perspective as to why we’ve become extremely externally focused.&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;led&nbsp;us down&nbsp;a path to provide self-service to our internal constituents so that they can develop models and develop IT solutions themselves, if you will, to get faster insights to the end customer.&nbsp;So it’s&nbsp;these&nbsp;reasons&nbsp;that have really driven us to being much more customer-focused. 
High:&nbsp;You mentioned Karen&nbsp;Quintos, Dell’s Chief Marketing Officer.&nbsp;I know that’s a particularly special relationship for you personally and for the organization, more generally speaking. As I am sure you have seen, there’s so much written on the need for greater collaboration between the CIO and the CMO and their respective organizations.&nbsp;There’s this famous Gartner pontification that by 2017 the CMO and the marketing department will control more of the IT’s&nbsp;spend&nbsp;than will the CIO.&nbsp;I wonder if you have any of your own thoughts on the evolution of that relationship as it applies to&nbsp;Dell in the specifics of yours and Karen’s relationship, but more generally speaking as well. 
Karaboutis:&nbsp;Candidly, we scratch our heads when we read a lot of the industry anecdotes about the CMO taking influence away from the CIO. Kudos to Michael and the entire leadership team, but when you have a mindset of customer first, you start to think “How do we get to the best insights so that we can respond the quickest to things, to our customers, and set things up?” The leads to better personalization strategies, great targeting strategies, market or product change and then all of a sudden these secondary and tertiary insights related to “Who’s got more budget?” and “Who’s doing what?” are less relevant. 
So Karen and I have forged a relationship where I am constantly contemplating how to help her move faster. My team is responsible for modeling, for instance. So we took&nbsp;our data warehouse, we set up in a three-tier architecture and we gave marketing a sandbox&nbsp;and&nbsp;said “Go do your own modeling, and then when it’s ready let’s put it in production together.”&nbsp;A few months back, Karen actually said “I guess we should know what each other’s budget is, because everybody says that one of us or the other has more,” and it was really a joke between us. 
  The advice I would give to other CMOs and CIOs is to do exactly what we’ve done:&nbsp;Put the customer at the center and figure out who’s got the best strength in each aspect of what you need to do&nbsp;in order to get insights of the customer and work together.&nbsp;There are technology savvy marketers and Marketing savvy IT people.&nbsp;You bring that together, and you can disrupt and really win in the marketplace.&nbsp;I wish it was something a lot more complicated than that, but it really is that.&nbsp;It’s a culture change and then a drive toward understanding Marketing and technology together and what they can deliver. 
High: You mentioned your emphasis on social media. You have a fairly sophisticated&nbsp;means&nbsp;of&nbsp;managing social media.&nbsp;Please talk a bit about that. 
Karaboutis: Internally we’re a very social company.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;the Salesforce Chatter tool, and probably one of the most active users is our CEO.&nbsp;He sets the tone from there, and we use it heavily internally.&nbsp;I’ve even turned IT to social to listen to our customer base for our own issues.&nbsp;There’s clinical data and there’s pathological data, right?&nbsp;Our trouble tickets and formal processes are one form of insight into how well we’re doing in IT, but it’s amazing when you go to a social site on a Saturday morning and you look at our connected workplace groups, and they’re talking about “Wow, the network’s working so much faster.&nbsp;What change was made?”&nbsp;Or “Hey, I’m still having an issue with this here,” and we’re actually monitoring all those things as an “internal customer first” to drive our performance. 
From an external perspective Karen’s led a world class job with social media and our social media center on how we listen to our customers externally and gain the insights that we need in order to again, modify our approaches, target&nbsp;sell personalization, and even take insights into our products. 
High: I also wanted to ask you, and as you mentioned earlier in the interview,&nbsp;you came from the automotive industry earlier in your career.&nbsp;I’ve always been amazed by the number of successful IT executives who have emerged from companies like GM,&nbsp;Ford, and&nbsp;others as you have.&nbsp;What is it about that experience that has lent itself well to such a profound development of leaders who have now spread like seeds across a variety of industries, just as you have? 
Karaboutis: My 21 years in the industry, 15 at Ford and six at General Motors, were absolutely tremendous years and I have&nbsp;a&nbsp;ton of respect for the automotive industry.&nbsp;A couple things: The&nbsp;auto industry provides a fantastic platform for discipline, the structure, the rigor, and the&nbsp;focus on quality that’s needed to really propel forward really strong CIOs.&nbsp;That common base and the time to&nbsp;train,&nbsp;develop,&nbsp;and&nbsp;grow&nbsp;is something the auto industry’s very good at.&nbsp;When I was coming up through the industry I was told&nbsp;“To be a successful leader we want to develop you in two ways:&nbsp;First, read the geography be in a global perspective, not just by leading a global team but living elsewhere.”&nbsp;I went to Europe for two and a half years. 
Also the best IT experience I ever had&nbsp;was&nbsp;not being in IT.&nbsp;I was sent cross-functionally and ran production control at Ford for a period of time, first in North America and then globally, and spent six years out of IT in the auto industry.&nbsp;That kind of foresight and that kind of planning in building and investing in people is something that is the core reason as to why&nbsp;you have seen so many CIO’s emerge out of the auto industry. 
High: So is that something that you brought with you to the culture at Dell IT in trying to get people&nbsp;to&nbsp;work a variety of experiences, so that they are expanding their personal toolbox, so to speak? 
Karaboutis: It is.&nbsp;We’re trying to develop people globally.&nbsp;We give people global teams, we send people on international assignments, and we try to rotate in.&nbsp;By the way, this is in the DNA of Dell as well, rotating people through various departments to get what we call the wide-angle lens view of the company.&nbsp;While many people argue about&nbsp;whether&nbsp;depth&nbsp;or breadth&nbsp;is important,&nbsp;it’s not either/or, it’s both.&nbsp;We really try to follow that and develop talent as best we can at Dell. It is a&nbsp;similar concept executed in various ways at Dell. 
High: We’ve talked about a few different IT trends&nbsp;and&nbsp;business trends that are fueled by technology and fueled by better use of information.&nbsp;I wanted to circle back and see if there are any others that particularly excite you as you look a few years out, as you think about your own plans for the year or for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;What are some of the trends that particularly excite you? 
Karaboutis: Of the so called “SMAC” trends of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, analytics is one that really excites me. Take the&nbsp;Internet of Things,&nbsp;which is yet another trend,&nbsp;and marry it with analytics. You can’t gain insights on the plethora of data unless you’ve got the right analytics, whether you have structured and unstructured data coming in.&nbsp;I think there’s great opportunity, in various industries,&nbsp;especially industries like healthcare for the benefit that can be gained for the end customer.&nbsp;In&nbsp;the&nbsp;Internet of Things architecture is important, and hasn’t been built out.&nbsp;I think it’s going to be in the next two or three years, probably the biggest disruptor that we have.
