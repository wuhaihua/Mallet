Sony Unveils Metallic Slime Edition PlayStation 4 Console Sony Unveils Metallic Slime Edition PlayStation 4 Console There is nothing wrong with the Sony PlayStation 4’s design at the moment. Some might disagree but in general it’s not like it’s a very ugly console to look at. That being said if you were looking for something a little more special, perhaps the Dragon Quest Metallic Slime Edition of the Sony PlayStation 4 could be of interest to you.
To mark the release of Dragon Quest Heroes, Sony has announced that they will be releasing a special edition PS4 to commemorate the launch. As you can see in the image above, the entire console, including its controller, has been given a new coat of metallic silver paint. However what makes it even more unique is the fact that there is a “slime” that appears to be oozing over the edge of the console.
The slime is actually pretty cute and according to Famitsu, it’s basically a USB cover that can be attached and detached from the console itself, but otherwise it lends a pretty unique look to the console. This special edition PS4 unit is expected to go on sale next spring where it will be released alongside the game, but unfortunately pricing has yet to be revealed.
It was also not mentioned if it could be a Japan-only exclusive or if it will see an international launch, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled anyway. In the meantime anyone planning on getting their hands on it?
