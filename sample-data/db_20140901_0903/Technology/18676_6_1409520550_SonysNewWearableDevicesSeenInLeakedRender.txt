Sony’s New Wearable Devices Seen In Leaked Render Sony’s New Wearable Devices Seen In Leaked Render 
Sony is one of the manufacturers that is going to unveil a handful of new devices next week at IFA 2014 in Berlin. The company has already teased a few of the devices that its going to launch. Others have been hinted at in rumors and various reports. A render has leaked online today which shows off Sony&#8217;s new wearable devices. Previous rumors have indicated that a new smartwatch is on the cards for IFA 2014.

We have already heard several rumors about the Sony SmartWatch 3. Apparently it is Sony&#8217;s Android Wear powered smartwatch that will be unveiled at IFA 2014. Reportedly it has a 1.68-inch display with a 320&#215;320 pixel resolution. Sony&#8217;s mobile devices boast water resistant capabilities and it is said that the Sony SmartWatch 3 does have IP58 certification.
But it looks like the SmartWatch 3 isn&#8217;t the only wearable device that Sony will be unveiled. The render also depicts a new SmartBand Talk from the company which is an addition to its Sony SmartBand lineup. It is said to have a curved e-ink display with Bluetooth connectivity.
The word &#8220;Talk&#8221; in the moniker suggests that it might have something to do with calls as well, but since its primarily a fitness tracker, its possible that the SmartBand Talk might notify users when the paired smartphone gets a call.
Nevertheless Sony is yet to confirm any of this right now but fortunately IFA 2014 isn&#8217;t far away, so we&#8217;ll know for sure in a few days.
