To bolster its growth in the U.S. it is also hiring a team in San Francisco.

DesignCrowd is a platform that allows people to post a design brief of jobs like a new logo, website or t-shirt; receive designs from a pool of designers and reward the winning designer with a budgeted amount of money. If you’re not happy with any of the designs, you get your money back, so it’s risk-free. 
 
The platform now has over 410,000 designers around the world and users in over 100 countries. Each brief receives 101 designs on average. 
The company launched in 2008. Last year it hit $10 million in payments to designers. This year, it has doubled its payments to $20 million. Next year, it aims to “hit $40 million” said Alec Lynch, CEO of DesignCrowd. In comparison, 99Designs has made more than $82 million in payouts to date. 
DesignCrowd has set up a presence in San Francisco and hired its first staff on the ground. The United States is DesignCrowd’s largest market, with 40% of overall sales from the US. The office is the first in the US, and will support the region. 
“While DesignCrowd started in Australia – it is now a global marketplace, with users in over 100 countries. The US became our largest source of sales without any staff there, and it remains a huge opportunity for further growth. &nbsp;Setting up an office in San Francisco and hiring our first staff there is incredibly exciting and will allow us to continue growing there,” said Lynch.
										
										 
DesignCrowd has reached a number of other milestones in the last 12 months. It has more than doubled its sales in the U.S., acquired Worth1000, opened a new office in Manila, more than doubled its creative community and is on track to reach half a million designers. 
DesignCrowd is backed by more than $6 million in funding from Starfish Ventures and angel investors.
