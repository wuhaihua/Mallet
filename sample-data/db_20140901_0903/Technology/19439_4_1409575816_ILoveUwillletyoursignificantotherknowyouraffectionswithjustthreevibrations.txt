ILoveU will let your significant other know your affections with just three vibrations ILoveU will let your significant other know your affections with just three vibrations Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you want to let your significant other know your feelings for them during the day, but don&#8217;t want to send another cliche message? Well, ILoveU is here to give you a subtle but meaningful way of connecting with that special someone and letting them know you care without words. The app works very simply &#8211; once paired with your lover&#8217;s device, linked by anniversary, whenever the fancy takes you the app will send three short vibrations to the other&#8217;s device as a subtle reminder that &#8220;ILoveU&#8221;.
The idea for the app came about when So Many Kittens developer, Jared, wanted to find a way of letting his wife he cared without saying it aloud or making a big deal of it in public. I think it&#8217;s great, whether the two of you are in a crowded place and want to give your partner a reassuring gesture, or are at work and simply want to let them know you&#8217;re thinking of them. It&#8217;s simple, and those three vibrations can convey a message that only your partner will understand.
