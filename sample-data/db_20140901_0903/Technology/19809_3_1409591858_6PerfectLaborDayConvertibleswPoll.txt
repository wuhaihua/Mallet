6 Perfect Labor Day Convertibles [w/Poll] 6 Perfect Labor Day Convertibles [w/Poll] 
We hope you’ve all been having a pretty happy, long weekend. And today, you might be hitting the beach or the BBQ. Whatever adventures might be waiting, we suggest you take a look at this 6 convertibles that would be perfect for any holiday outing (click on the links to learn more):



It may not be the most expensive car on the list, but the Mazda Miata truly is a classic roadster. Probably one of the best. Load up the trunk with towels and sunscreen and head straight for the ocean.


Ok, say you want to get where you’re going in a bit more of a hurry. If you happen to have $265K lying around, the McLaren 650S Spider might be the quickest and prettiest way to get you there.


Throwback to 1958, the year the very first Austin-Healey Sprite was built. This quirky fun little convertible has turned into a bit of a collectors item today. But if you can find one for a decent price, it’s one of the most fun classic convertibles money can buy.


2014 really is the year of the Corvette. And what better way to get to that beach BBQ than top down, wind blowing in a Corvette Stingray.


But maybe you want something a little more exotic, a little more exciting. You can pony up some dough for a stunning Jaguar F-Type and listen to that engine roar the whole way down the road.


Is there anything more Americana than the Chevrolet Bel Air? We definitely wouldn’t mind hitting to the beach in this little slice of history.
