Plane Finder: Replay Air Traffic Movements Plane Finder: Replay Air Traffic Movements Plane Finder is a popular app for tracking flights around the world in real-time. Want to know where the plane that just flew over you was heading? Plane Finder has you covered.
However, an interesting feature has been introduced for version 7.3.0 (iPhone/iPad) – it now lets you replay historical flights, going all the way back to April 2011.
While Plane Finder is generally reserved for serious plane geekery, it could actually be interesting to look at how major events such as hurricanes or volcanic ash clouds impacted flights as the planes moved (or not) around the world. Or, you could just sit and watch flights traverse the globe for the past 24 hours. The choice is yours.
Plane Finder is available to download from the App Store now, costing $4.99 or your local currency equivalent.
