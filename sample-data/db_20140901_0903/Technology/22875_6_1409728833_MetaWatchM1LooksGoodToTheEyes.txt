Meta Watch M1 Looks Good To The Eyes Meta Watch M1 Looks Good To The Eyes When it comes to wearable technology, you know for sure that there are many different kinds of models to choose from, ranging from smart glasses to smart watches. The smart watch category has more or less picked up steam these days, and here we are with what they call the Meta Watch M1. This piece of wearable tech hails from former Fossil engineer Bill Geiser and designer Frank Nuovo, where it looks more like a regular watch instead of the smart watch that it is meant to be. 
Does this mean that it comes with gimped functionality? Far from it, as it will feature the likes of call pick-up and control, music management, and PIM notifications that will appear on the timepiece. The Meta Watch M1 has already begun to ship, and it will carry with it an accompanying $249 price tag which boasts of half a dozen buttons. There are buttons at the 3 and 9 oâ€™clock which will control the back and forth functions, while the buttons in the corner have been integrated into the lugs to let you adjust the light and menu settings. Synchronizing with any iOS or Android device, it even boasts of a handy weather feature, not to mention dish out the latest sports scores for sporting enthusiasts.
