Yerka Project Could Deliver “Unstealable” Bicycle Yerka Project Could Deliver “Unstealable” Bicycle Bicycles are dime a dozen, and these days, there seems to be more and more electric-powered bicycles in the market that will help you tackle those uphill bits, while letting you pedal to your heart’s content on flat ground as well as when you take a ride downhill. However, some of the more expensive bicycles out there could end up to be a target for thieves, and this is where the Yerka Project comes in, where it is touted to deliver the world’s first “unstealable” bicycle.
The Yerka bicycle will ensure that its own frame is the lock itself, letting you wrap the frame around a tree or lamp post. Despite its rather innovative locking frame, Yerka has managed to retain the style of a typical urban bike. This is the brainchild of a trio of engineering students from Chile who managed to figure out the method to make the lock an integral part of the bike. To break the lock would mean breaking the bicycle, which would not benefit the thief at all. Cutting off the nose to spite the face, so to speak &#8211; simply brilliant!
Right now, this is but a prototype, but the students do hope to be able to garner the support of the masses in order to transform this dream into a reality. Sounds like a job for a crowdfunding project, don&#8217;t you think so?
