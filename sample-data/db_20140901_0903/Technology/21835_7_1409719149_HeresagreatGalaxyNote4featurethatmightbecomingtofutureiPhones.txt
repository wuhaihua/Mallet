					Apple is giving both of its operating systems major facelifts this fall with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, but after 44 new patents were granted to the company on Tuesday, it&#8217;s clear that these updates are only the beginning. Patently Apple is focusing on a few of the most significant patents, starting with moving radial menus, a feature found on Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note line of phablets.FROM EARLIER: 5 huge changes iPhone 6 owners will have to adapt toThe patent is specifically for a computer program which will determine if the user is too close to the edge of the screen when attempting to open a radial menu either through touch or with a mouse. Radial menus would serve as an alternative to drop-down menus, allowing developers to build easy-to-access menus and submenus throughout their apps.This isn&#8217;t the first time the USPTO has published an Apple patent on radial menus either — according to Patently Apple, a patent for a &#8220;method of displaying radial menus&#8221; was granted in 2012.As Apple&#8217;s mobile display grows in size, it would make sense that the company would take advantage of the increased real estate. The Air Command-like feature hasn&#8217;t made an appearance in the beta releases of either iOS 8 or OS X Yosemite up to this point, so it&#8217;s safe to assume Apple is saving radial menus for a future update.
