Next-gen flagship Moto X+1 leaks in new photos Next-gen flagship Moto X+1 leaks in new photos 
					Motorola is set to announce a handful of new products later this week during a media gathering that BGR will be attending, but it looks like the star of the show has made an early appearance. TK Tech News on Monday posted photos it claims show the upcoming Motorola Moto X+1, and the images appear to be authentic.There are a few interesting takeaways from the photos.First, it looks like Motorola may have its exotic case backs ready for launch this time around. Early buyers of last year&#8217;s Moto X didn&#8217;t have access to fun materials like wood, and reports suggest that this year&#8217;s model will be available in even more unique finishes. The new photos show the Moto X+1 with a wood battery cover, but aluminum, leather, denim and carbon fiber case backs are also expected.The other big takeaway is the fact that the Moto X+1 appears to have four front-facing sensors arranged in a fashion similar to the Amazon Fire phone. One of TK Tech News&#8217; sources says that these sensors will be used to enable a special 3D user interface effect, but another says they will &#8220;function in concert with Moto Aware and Moto 360.&#8221;The leaked photos follow below.
