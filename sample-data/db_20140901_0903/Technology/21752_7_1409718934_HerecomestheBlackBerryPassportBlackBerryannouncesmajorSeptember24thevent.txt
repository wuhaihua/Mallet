Here comes the BlackBerry Passport: BlackBerry announces major September 24th event Here comes the BlackBerry Passport: BlackBerry announces major September 24th event 
					The iPhone 6, the Galaxy Note 4 and the Moto X+1 aren&#8217;t the only major flagship phones that are going to be released in September. BlackBerry has just announced that it&#8217;s holding a major media event on September 24th that will almost certainly feature the new BlackBerry Passport handset. FROM EARLIER: BlackBerry says its square phone is already stealing back iOS and Android usersIn its invitation, BlackBerry only tells us that the event will help us &#8220;see the bigger picture,&#8221; which in all likelihood is a sly reference to the BlackBerry Passport&#8217;s 4.5-inch square display with a resolution of 1,440 x 1,440 pixels that BlackBerry has boasted is perfect for doctors who want to look at x-rays of lungs on their smartphones.In addition to crowing about the new square display, BlackBerry has also been touting the Passport&#8217;s &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; new keyboard that will be “responsive to touch, so you have more ways to control your smartphone without having to use the touchscreen.” This basically means that gliding your hand over the keys will let you scroll up and down on your smartphone display.Leaked specs for the Passport show the device will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz quad-core processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, a 2-megapixel front-facing camera and a massive 3450mAH battery.
