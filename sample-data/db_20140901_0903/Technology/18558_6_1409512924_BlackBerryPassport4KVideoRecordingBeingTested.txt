BlackBerry Passport 4K Video Recording Being Tested BlackBerry Passport 4K Video Recording Being Tested 
One of the upcoming smartphones that I am particularly looking forward to is the BlackBerry Passport. It is due to be released in September. The Passport is now expected to be BlackBerry&#8217;s saving grace since it has seen sales dip continuously over the past few years. It will be interesting to see how this smartphone performs in the market and if its able to win back any lost market share. Another feature that the Passport might have is 4K video recording, according to reports, this feature is currently being tested.

An image tweeted out by @DHabkirk reveals that BlackBerry is tinkering with the idea of adding 4K video recording to the BlackBerry Passport.Â According to previous rumors the Passport is going to have a 13 megapixel rear camera with auto-focus and Optical Image Stabilization aided by a 5-element f2.0 lens. This might be the best rear camera yet on a BB smartphone.
As per the report, BlackBerry Passport isn&#8217;t going to feature 4K video recording when it initially launches in September. It will likely be added later through BlackBerry 10.3.1 OS which may be released a couple of months after the device comes out.
On paper it would be a good feature to have for BlackBerry&#8217;s new flagship smartphone even though one can argue against the logic of having 4K video recording capability on a smartphone. Most high-end smartphones have this feature, and if the Passport wants to stand up against them, BB will certainly need all it can get on the spec sheet.
