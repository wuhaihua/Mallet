Windows 9 Logo Let Out Of The Bag By Microsoft China Windows 9 Logo Let Out Of The Bag By Microsoft China According to the rumors that we have heard a couple of weeks ago, Microsoft is apparently getting ready to announce the preview of their upcoming OS Windows 9 on the 30th of September. Given that Windows 8 hasn’t been around that long and considering that there has been no official word on Windows 9, it does seem like a bit of a stretch, or is it?
It seems that someone at Microsoft could be in big trouble as they might have jumped the gun regarding Windows 9. As spotted by Cnbeta (via The Verge), Microsoft China might have accidentally posted a teaser image/logo for the upcoming Windows 9, which you can see in the image above.
The post on Weibo has since been removed, although safe to say that didn’t really accomplish much as the image has since been making its rounds. The post was also accompanied by some text which when translated reads, &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s latest OS Windows 9 is coming soon, do you think the start menu at the left bottom will make a come back?&#8221;
There have been rumors suggesting that the next Windows could be known as Threshold as well, although we guess based on the leaked logo, Threshold is most probably the internal codename used to refer to Windows 9, and that the Windows 9 moniker will most likely be the final version. In any case hopefully we will hear more about Windows 9 soon, so check back with us on the 30th of September for the details.
