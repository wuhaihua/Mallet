Sony&#8217;s IFA Press Conference is one of the ones to watch at every IFA show, simply because of how important it is on the Sony Mobile calendar. 
Let&#8217;s not forget that for the last two years, the Mobile division has announced both the Sony Xperia Z, Z1 and the amazing Z2, as well as some awesomely weird and wonderful lens gear.
Here&#8217;s hoping this year we get something similar, maybe the Xperia Z3, if the naming conventions are being followed to the letter? We&#8217;ll all find out soon enough.
