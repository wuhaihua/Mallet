Woman impaled while texting and driving Woman impaled while texting and driving Christina Jahnz says she was lucky.Most people think they can multitask safely, even when texting and driving.

I  looked down to make sure it was all right. The next thing I knew, I was  looking up, there was white powder from the air bags deployed," she said. 	The air bag was the least of her problems. She had struck metal railing, which pierced her truck's light and entered her thigh and buttocks. The metal railing ended up embedded in her truck seat. 	She says she was distracted for merely a moment. However, she said of the medical staff who treated her in hospital: "They said if it gone just a little bit the other way I would have bled out."Jahnz is expected to make a complete recovery. Will people stop texting and driving only when they experience an accident? Or do we need some sort of technology to save us from ourselves?
