HTC One Mini 2 Lands In Australia As A Telstra Exclusive HTC One Mini 2 Lands In Australia As A Telstra Exclusive 
What&#8217;s in a name? Well if you read the name of HTC&#8217;s latest smartphone a couple of times you quickly begin to realise it&#8217;s quite a lot. Especially when you&#8217;re phone is confusingly named the One Mini 2. This won&#8217;t end badly at all! Anyway, the new One Mini is finally in Australia, and it&#8217;s exclusive to Telstra. Here&#8217;s how much you&#8217;ll shell out for it if you&#8217;re a fan of the smaller device.
The One Mini 2 is the latest smartphone from HTC, building on the original One Mini from last year. It has a 4.5-inch, 1280&#215;720 display, a quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor, 1GB of RAM and a 13 megapixel camera (none of this 4-megapixel Ultrapixel business this time around) and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera to boot.
It&#8217;s also wearing a similar design to the all-metal HTC One M8 flagship introduced earlier this year.
You&#8217;ll find boosted network capabilities under the hood on the One Mini 2, with support for Telstra&#8217;s upcoming 700MHz network for faster speeds and more consistent coverage. You can only get 700MHz in a few select areas right now, but Telstra&#8217;s working on it.
The One Mini 2 retails outright for $528 from Telstra, or if you&#8217;re in need of it on a plan, you can get it for $5 per month extra over 24 months on the $55 Mobile Accelerate plan.
