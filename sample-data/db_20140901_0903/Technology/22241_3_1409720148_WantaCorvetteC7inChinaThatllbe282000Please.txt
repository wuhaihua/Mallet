The C7 Corvette has debuted to worldwide acclaim. Its styling, its performance and its driving characteristics are all big hits. So it&#8217;s only natural that there be high demand anywhere where there are roads and disposable income.
China has plenty of both of these things, but unfortunately for the People&#8217;s Republic, GM isn&#8217;t officially selling the Corvette C7 in China and hasn&#8217;t confirmed plans to do so. Now, though, the Chinese are doing what we Americans do when we can&#8217;t easily get our hands on the coolest stuff from Europe and Japan. They&#8217;re turning to the grey market.


According to CarNewsChina, Chinese dealers are taking delivery of new Corvettes from other dealers on the West Coast of the US. Two cars have recently arrived in Beijing with a staggering markup. The Corvette C7 starts at a reasonable $53,000 on the domestic market, but the cars in Beijing are priced at 1.73 million yuan and 1.68 million yuan. That&#8217;s $282,000 and $273,000, respectively.

As to why these Corvettes are priced at over four times what they would be in the States, the answer may be as simple as the fact that they can get away with it. With 460 horsepower, 0-60 in 3.9 seconds and a top speed of almost 180 miles per hour, the C7 has the performance to match European exotics that are also popular in China. Simple supply and demand means that when there are so few of those highly desirable cars around, there are people who will gladly pay a premium for that exclusivity.
