					So it looks like we&#8217;re going to get our first glimpse of the iWatch (or at least some kind of Apple wearable computer) on September 9th. However, it&#8217;s also looking more and more like we&#8217;re going to be in for a long wait before we&#8217;ll actually have a chance to buy the device. Digitimes&#8216; sources now say that the iWatch &#8220;is still under engineering verification testing (EVT) stage and has to still go through production verification testing (PVT),&#8221; which means there&#8217;s almost no chance that the device will release before the end of the year.FROM EARLIER: Here comes the iWatch — First Apple wearable computer reportedly set for September 9th revealWhat&#8217;s more, Digitimes&#8216; sources say that Apple could still change the design of the device in between the EVT and PVT stages, which means that what we see at Apple&#8217;s big event next week isn&#8217;t guaranteed to be the final version of the device.Unlike the iPhone 6, which has practically been leaked to death at this point, the iWatch is still shrouded in almost total mystery. We still haven’t seen any leaked images of the device yet and it likely won’t go into mass production until later this year. In fact, we still don’t know whether what Apple plans to show off on September 9th will be an actual smartwatch like the Moto 360 or a Nike FuelBand-style fitness band.
