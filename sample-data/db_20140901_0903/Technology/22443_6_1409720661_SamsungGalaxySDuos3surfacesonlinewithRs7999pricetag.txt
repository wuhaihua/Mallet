								Samsung may soon launch its budget Galaxy S Duos 3 smartphone in India. A Mumbai-based retail store has claimed to stock the latest device, which was also one to first revealed the Galaxy Ace NXT before it was officially launched by Samsung.
&nbsp;
The Galaxy S Duos 3 is a basic, dual-SIM smartphone with a 4-inch 480&#215;800 pixel display. It features a 5 MP rear camera with LED flash and a VGA front camera. The phone is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB RAM and a 1500 mAH battery. There&#8217;s 4GB of internal storage, which can be boosted up to 32GB. The specifications are similar to the Asus Zenfone 4, which also sports a 4-inch display, a 5MP camera and a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor. However, the Zenfone 4 is cheaper at Rs 5,999 and comes with 8GB of internal storage.
&nbsp;
On the brighter side, the phone runs on Android 4.4 KitKat and supports 14 regional languages. It comes with all the necessary connectivity options including 3G HSDPA+, FM radio, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

Samsung may have to get its pricing right in order to win back the crowd with the latest budget phone. Even though the phone is selling lower than its MRP, it&#8217;s still overpriced for the features it offers. The Moto E and Zenfone 4 bring much more to the table at lower costs. However, what might work in Samsung&#8217;s favour is the fact that the phone is available even in physical retail stores unlike rival phones from Xiaomi and Motorola.
