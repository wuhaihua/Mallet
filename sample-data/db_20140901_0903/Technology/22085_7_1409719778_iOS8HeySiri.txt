iOS 8: Hey Siri! iOS 8: Hey Siri! 	

It&apos;s surprising how much I both love and am bothered by the new Hey Siri feature. It offers what&apos;s probably the best and the worst of all iOS 8 features at the same time. So what&apos;s this dichotomy? How can I be so split down the middle about this? Let me explain.iOS 8&apos;s new &quot;Hey Siri&quot; offers a voice activated prompt. If you&apos;re driving and your iPhone is connected to a power source, or if your iPad is charging across the room, you can shout out &quot;Hey Siri, set a timer for 3 minutes&quot; and Siri will do exactly that. A few minutes later, your device will beep and you&apos;ll know to take the eggs off the stove.&quot;Hey Siri&quot; is great for quick calculations (&quot;What&apos;s 371 divided by four?&quot;), for shazaaming (&quot;What&apos;s that song?&quot;), for requesting songs (&quot;Play something by Josh Turner&quot;), for directions (&quot;How do I get to a gas station?&quot;) and so forth. The hands-free functionality is amazing.At the same time, you have to be really really careful about where and when you deploy &quot;Hey Siri&quot;. I can&apos;t tell you how many times I&apos;ve been talking on my landline and Siri pipes up and offered to run a web search based on my current conversation. It&apos;s a little embarrassing when chatting but it can be quite serious in professional meetings or with privileged conversations such as in a medical setting.Fortunately, you can easily disable voice-activated Siri. First, just unplug your device. &quot;Hey Siri&quot; is currently limited to power-tethered use. Second, you can override Siri by hopping into Settings &gt; General &gt; Siri &gt; Voice Activation and toggle the option to OFF. This is a feature that really should have been placed into the Control Center -- I encourage you to file a feature request to put it there!But once you&apos;re back away from those possibly awkward moments? Turn that feature right back on because Hey Siri is a real favorite, warts and all.
