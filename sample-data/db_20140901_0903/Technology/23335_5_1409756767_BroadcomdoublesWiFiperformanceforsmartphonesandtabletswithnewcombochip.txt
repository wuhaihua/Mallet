Broadcom announced a new Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chip today that the manufacturer claims will double wireless networking performance of high-end smartphones and tablets. The hardware vendor claims that users spend an estimated four to five hours everyday on Wi-Fi, and that with the new chipset, they will be able to download and stream content twice as fast as current-gen devices and with less lag.



Key features of the new chipset, dubbed BCM4358, include improved Wi-Fi data throughput at 650 Mbps, enhanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth coexistence performance, second-generation 2Ã—2 MIMO and transmit beamforming, which pinpoints a device's location within a network to provide better throughput to that location. The chipset supports Android, Windows and Chrome operating systems, and is the highest-performing 5G 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chip in the market, according to Broadcom.

Broadcom has mentioned that the BCM4358 is in production, with consumer devices featuring the chipset set to be available later this quarter.
