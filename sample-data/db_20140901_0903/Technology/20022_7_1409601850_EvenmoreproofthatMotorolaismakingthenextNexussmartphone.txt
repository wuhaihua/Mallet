Even more proof that Motorola is making the next Nexus smartphone Even more proof that Motorola is making the next Nexus smartphone 
					After numerous reports revealed that the Motorola Shamu is actually the next Nexus smartphone, and that the Nexus 6 smartphone may be quietly released as the Nexus X later this year, Phone Arena has discovered even more proof that Motorola is indeed working on such a device.FROM EARLIER: Two very different Nexus X models might launch this yearA prototype Motorola Shamu handset (model number XT1112) has been listed on Zauba, a website that tracks imports and exports in India. The listing does not mention any details about the device, but it does note the Shamu comes from the United States and it’s being shipped to India “for demo purposes.”Furthermore, the shipping manifest says that two Shamu units were delivered for testing, each one having an approximate value of 34,982 Rupees, or around $578.Recent leaks showing alleged store listings for the device have revealed a high price for the Nexus X, which is expected to arrive in at least two versions when it comes to storage options, including 32GB and 64GB. The same listings also said the Nexus X&#8217;s model number is XT1100, which happens to be very similar to the XT1112 model number mentioned in Zauba documents.The phone is expected to pack high-end specs, which could explain higher manufacturing costs for the device, including a 2560 x 1440 resolution (2K) display and quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor.The Nexus X is said to launch around Halloween, likely as soon as Google’s Android L is ready for public launch.An image showing Zauba&#8217;s shipping manifest that mentions the Shamu follows below.
