Microsoft Teases Its Lumia ‘Selfie’ Phone Microsoft Teases Its Lumia ‘Selfie’ Phone 
IFA 2014 is coming up this week and we&#8217;re all anxiously waiting to see what products will be announced at the trade show. Microsoft has already confirmed that it will have something to show us at IFA. Today the company has posted another teaser of what to expect. The teaser lines up with rumors about Microsoft unveiling a new Lumia smartphone which will also be known as a &#8220;selfie&#8221; phone. Its pretty self-explanatory, the smartphone is likely to have a good front facing camera that&#8217;s ideal for taking selfies.

Rumors about this smartphone started floating a couple of months ago. Apparently it carries the &#8220;Superman&#8221; codename internally. Several images of the device have surfaced online as well, some as recently as last week, and rumors suggest that it will have a 5 megapixel front camera.
As far as the other specifications are concerned it is believed to be a mid-range device. Microsoft may only be looking to counter the likes of Sony, which has a similar &#8220;selfie&#8221; phone in the Xperia C3. Other manufacturers have similar plans.
The teaser that Microsoft has posted online shows a selfie, so now its pretty clear what&#8217;s going to come at IFA. Microsoft will formally make the announcement on September 4th. The webcast begins on the official Nokia Conversations blog, which is now run by Microsoft, at 10am CET&gt;
