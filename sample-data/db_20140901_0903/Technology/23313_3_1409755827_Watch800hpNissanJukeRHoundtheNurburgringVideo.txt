A few years back, Nissan shocked the world when it outfitted a Juke with the internals from its hallowed GT-R supercar. The results were savage, but apparently not loony enough for some.
Think of this then as the Juke-R MkII. Built by Shpilli-Villi Engineering, this reproduction Juke-R still boasts GT-R underpinnings, but packs on a helluva lot more power – 800 horsepower to be exact, plus a 200-horsepower shot of nitrous.


That makes for more than enough grunt to rocket the hefty 3,527-pound CUV around the Nürburgring, and we can imagine it’s quite the eye-opener to drive on a wet track, as seen above.
From the cockpit view, it’s easy to see the outright speed that the Shpilli-Villi Juke-R is capable of, but it’s a bit hard to picture it all happening inside a stout, upright crossover. Enjoy!
