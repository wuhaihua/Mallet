Apple acknowledged on Tuesday that celebrity accounts had been accessed and that photos were stolen from them, but it disavowed any systemic breach of its systems.
In the statement, the company says it was "outraged" by the leaked photos that began appearing Sunday and "immediately mobilized Apple's engineers to discover the source."
"After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet," the statement continued.
Apple said that none of the cases it investigated "resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone." The company is "continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved."
Apple adds that to protect against this type of attack, users should use strong passwords and enable two-step verification.
