ASUS Announces the Radeon R9 285 Strix Graphics Card ASUS Announces the Radeon R9 285 Strix Graphics Card ASUS announced the Radeon R9 285 Strix graphics card, based on AMD's latest 28 nm "Tonga" silicon. The card utilizes ASUS' latest Strix cooling solution, which stays silent until a thermal threshold is reached, only beyond which, its fans begin to spool up. Barring its new cooler shroud design and fan-speed management, the Strix cooling solution bears strong resemblance to the company's DirectCU II cooling solution. ASUS is shipping the card with a factory-overclock. Based on the 28 nm "Tonga" silicon, the R9 285 from AMD features 1,792 stream processors, 112 TMUs, 32 ROPs, and a 256-bit wide memory interface, which holds 2 GB of memory on this card.
