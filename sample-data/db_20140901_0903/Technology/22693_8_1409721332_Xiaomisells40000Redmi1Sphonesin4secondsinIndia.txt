                                    While the company recently got in trouble with Taiwanese authorities over the accuracy of its sales numbers, the situation in India is a different matter altogether.In India, Xiaomi has partnered with e-commerce retail site Flipkart to sell its devices. The site uses registrations of interest to provide a virtual queue for users to make purchases and so far, the demand for the Redmi 1S far exceeds supply with over 250,000 users wanting to buy the new phone.The Redmi 1S is the follow up to the Redmi, an Android phone that offered exceptional value for its low price. The Redmi 1S just as tempting -- it comes with a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.6GHz and twice the storage space at 8GB. The smartphone still has an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 4.7-inch display with an HD resolution of 1,280x720 pixels.Besides India, the Redmi 1S is currently sold in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and will be launching in the Philippines and Indonesia on September 4.
