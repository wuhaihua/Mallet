With its powerful octa-core chip and unusual display, Meizu MX4 is great – but can it “handle” Ubuntu Touch? Yesterday Meizu announced its latest flagship device, the MX4, and we love it. This bad boy comes with a 5.36-inch IPS display with unusual resolution of 1920 x 1152 pixels; that&#8217;s 418 PPI for those who count these sort of things.
MediaTek&#8217;s brand-new MT6595 octa-core chip is providing the processing power needed to run things smoothly. Said SoC rocks four high-performance Cortex-A17 and four energy-efficient Cortex-A7 cores. This combo can apparently score as high as 47,000 points at the popular benchmark website AnTuTu; so yes, future owners of the MX4 will get one fast phone.
The MX4&#8242;s camera is also rock-solid. The Chinese firm used Sony&#8217;s 20.7-megapixel IMX 220 Exmor RS BSI sensor with f/2.2 aperture, while adding dual-tone LED flash to the mix. And thanks to the mentioned fast chip, camera supports 4K video recording and 720p slow motion capture.
There&#8217;s also 2GB of RAM, 2.1MP front-facing camera, NXP Smart PA second-gen audio chip, 4G LTE connectivity support, (TD-LTE / LTE-FDD), 3,100 mAh battery, and 16, 32 or 64 GB of internal storage.
All this comes boxed in a 8.9mm-thin body that weighs 147 grams. Meizu&#8217;s own Flyme OS 4.0 is running the show, though we gotta wonder whether the same configuration will be able to cope with Ubuntu.
As far as we know, Meizu is one of Canonical&#8217;s partners which will launch one of the first, if not the very first, Ubuntu-powered smartphone this year. Said device should bring the true convergence, allowing users to use one device both as a mobile phone and as desktop computer. Can&#8217;t wait for it; and in the meantime, I would have no problems reviewing the Flyme-based MX4.  
Finally, the prices: 16, 32 and 64 GB variants will go for 1799 CYN (about $290), 1999 CYN ($325) and 2399 CYN ($390), respectively. Pre-bookings have already started with first devices shipping to Chinese customers on September 20th.
