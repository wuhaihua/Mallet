WhatsApp Support For Android Wear Now Out Of Beta WhatsApp Support For Android Wear Now Out Of Beta 
For those who don&#8217;t know, Android Wear is a new platform that Google has built from the ground up for wearable devices. A handful of devices powered by this platform have already been released in the market. Developers have supported apps for these devices as well and one of the biggest names to jump on the Android Wear bandwagon was WhatsApp. Today the popular cross-platform messaging service&#8217;s app sees the support come out of beta.

Previously WhatsApp support for Android Wear was only available for beta users. The app had to be sideloaded, a process that many novice users might find a bit cumbersome. Now though the support is included in the general release which is easily downloadable through the Google Play Store.
The updated app brings support for entire WhatsApp messages to be displayed on the Android Wear smartwatch as opposed to truncated notifications. It also has support for displaying individual sender&#8217;s name during a group conversation. Stacked notifications ensure that users never run the risk of missing out on a message.
It is possible to reply to messages through the smartwatch as well though only voice replies are supported as of now since there&#8217;s no native keyboard in Android Wear. The updated app also has improved message storage reliability and the usual slew of bug fixes and performance updates. It is available for download now via the Google Play Store.
