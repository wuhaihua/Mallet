Lenovo ERAZER X310 & X315: Affordable Gaming Desktop PCs Lenovo ERAZER X310 & X315: Affordable Gaming Desktop PCs The ERAZER X310 and X315 are two version of the same Lenovo Desktop gaming system. Just by looking at it, you can guess what it is, and to be fair, I find the design to be largely reminiscent of Alienware, except smaller, which is not a bad thing at all.
The tower is actually fairly average in size and has nothing to do with the massive rigs that you may have seen from various “Gaming” PC makers. There are some opportunities for expansion, but I expect many X310 customers to just buy the system and use it “as is”.
Both systems can receive up to 32GB of RAM, and a fast GPU like the NVIDIA GTX 760 (2GB) or an AMD Radeon R9 (2GB, X310 only). Storage-wise, buyers can choose between 256GB of SSD storage, 2TB of hybrid storage or 4TB of hard disk drives (HDD).
At $599+, this is an affordable gaming system which could work great for those who want to play without breaking the bank, and without having to build their own rigs. It’s well known that there’s no price limit when it comes to gaming rigs, but it possible to get a very decent gaming experience at $599.
