The Sony Xperia Z3 and e-ink SmartBand get press image leak treatment The Sony Xperia Z3 and e-ink SmartBand get press image leak treatment The Sony IFA 2014 press conference may only be hours away, but that still hasn&#8217;t stopped leaked press images of their latest flagship, theÂ Sony Xperia Z3, from leaking out. Like the leak of the Xperia Z3 Compact we saw a few days ago, the Xperia Z3 appears to be depicted in multiple colour variations as well, and some of them, as well as the overall design of the device, look absolutely divine, if we do say so ourselves. What is also intriguing about this set of leaked images is the following picture in particular:
While the image may look harmlessly like a standard press image for the Xperia Z3, it&#8217;s the device on the lady&#8217;s wrist that is of most interest. After rumours that a certain &#8220;SmartBand Talk&#8221; wearable exists, the appearance of this e-ink display fitness wearable looks like pretty good evidence that such a device exists. Whether Sony will actually announce it as part of their IFA 2014 presentation is another question entirely.





I looks like Sony has moved away from its stock-standard Xperia device design for the Xperia Z3, adding colour to the frame as well as the panels as well. We can&#8217;t wait to hear more about the device in a few hours; we&#8217;ll be sure to put up a livestream once we find one.
What do you think about the Sony Xperia Z3 and this possible SmartBand device? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
