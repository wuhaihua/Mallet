BERLIN — Asus' event ahead of IFA Berlin brought us a tablet and a smartwatch, but Asus wouldn't be Asus if it didn't have a couple of laptops to show as well. 
The star of the show was the Zenbook, an aluminum 13.3-inch laptop with an insanely high resolution of 3,200x1,800 pixels (that's 276 ppi if you're counting). 

Now, we've seen laptop screens with even higher pixel density, but Asus claims their new Zenbook is also the world's slimmest 13.3-inch laptop — it's only 12.3mm (0.48 inches) thin, and weighs 1.2kg (2.65 pounds). Not a bad combo — although we have to point out that the display is not a touchscreen. 
Inside, you'll find an Intel Core M processor and 128/256GB of storage — and that's all Asus was ready to disclose at this point. 
It will be available in two colors: Ceramic Alloy and Obsidian Stone, at a yet-unannounced price.
Asus also gave us a blast to the netbook past with a new ultraportable, the EeeBook X205. For the price of 199 euros in Europe, you get an 11.6-inch machine running on Windows 8.1.
