Reddit's New App Lets You Read AMAs On Your IPhone Reddit's New App Lets You Read AMAs On Your IPhone 
Reddit&#8217;s AMAs (Ask Me Anything) are the one of the best things about the network. But let&#8217;s face it: Reddit isn&#8217;t the world&#8217;s prettiest website. The learning curve is fairly steep. Clearly, Reddit thinks so too, because it has now released a rather good-looking app to read and participate in AMAs.

The AMA app, available on iOS only to begin with, lets you filter out any questions that weren&#8217;t replied to by the person who started the AMA (more often than not a celebrity). So you can read the whole thing as a straightforward Q &amp; A. You can also participate in the AMA directly from the app by asking questions and check out trending AMAs at a glance.
&#8220;We want to make it easier for new users to join Reddit and experience all the awesome content,&#8221; senior VP Ellen Pao told Variety. &#8220;That&#8217;s part of the overall goal of becoming a more mature company.&#8221;
The app will be available for Android later this week. [Variety via The Verge]
