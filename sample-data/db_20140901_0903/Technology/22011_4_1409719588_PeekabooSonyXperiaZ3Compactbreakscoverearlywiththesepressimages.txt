Peekaboo: Sony Xperia Z3 Compact breaks cover early with these press images Peekaboo: Sony Xperia Z3 Compact breaks cover early with these press images Try as they might, Sony just can&#8217;t stop the device leaks from dropping. Today&#8217;s victim is the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact which is expected to be announced at IFA 2014 in just a few days. The leak comes in the form of press images which show the Z3 Compact in all its colourful glory, looking very much the evolutionary product of its predecessor, the Xperia Z1 Compact.
Accompanying the images are some specs as well &#8211; a 4.6-inch 720p display, a Snapdragon 801 2.5GHz processor, a 2,600mAh battery and that 20.7MP camera we all love. If we had to guess, we&#8217;d say the Sony Xperia Z3, also expected to be announced in the same breath as the Z3 Compact, will likely have the same specs, if not slightly better. All the same, the Z3 Compact looks to be carrying on the fine tradition Sony has started by releasing a small-form smartphone with premium performance. It&#8217;s also said to be the first Sony Xperia device to use a nano-SIM, so watch out for that too when the Sony press conference rolls by.
