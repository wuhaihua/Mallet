Sony Teases Water Resistant Products For IFA 2014 Sony Teases Water Resistant Products For IFA 2014 Earlier today Sony posted a teaser image on Twitter in which they seemed to tease the dimensions for an upcoming device. Based on the dimensions there was a good chance that Sony could be referring to the upcoming Sony Xperia Z3 which would be the company’s second flagship smartphone for 2014.
That being said, Sony has posted a new teaser and this time it seems to hint at how water resistant their devices are going to be. As you can see in the image above, the teaser image suggests that Sony’s products will be water resistant up to 2m in depth. It is unclear if this is a general teaser for Sony’s mobile devices, or if it could be for the Sony Xperia Z3.
We expect that Sony will be announcing the Xperia Z3 Compact and the Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact alongside the Xperia Z3, so there is a chance that the image could be in reference to all of Sony’s mobile devices or just their flagship phone. Either way it’s starting to seem that water and dust resistance is becoming a common feature among smartphones these days.
In fact leaked photos of the Xperia Z3 has suggested that Sony could be upping their game but either way do check back with us during IFA, which is kicking off this week, for the details!
