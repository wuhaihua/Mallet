Samsung SM-G5309W Spotted Samsung SM-G5309W Spotted Samsung is one company that loves to spread its bets, so to speak. Otherwise, there is no reason for it to target every single market segment when it comes to the different kinds of smartphones on the market, right? Well, it seems that there is yet another device that is all set to be released, and that comes in the form of the Samsung SM-G5309W. It is touted to be a 5” smartphone which will run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410 processor. 
This particular smartphone happens to carry the model number SM-G5309W, where it has also gained the collective nod of approval by the folks over at China’s Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center. 
Sporting a classic Samsung Android handset design, this will be a mid-range or some might even deem it to be an entry level device, where it sports a 5” display at 540 x 960 pixels resolution, carrying Android 4.4 KitKat as the mobile operating system of choice, a 5MP shooter in front alongside an 8MP camera at the back with flash. There will also be 1GB RAM, 8GB of internal memory, and a microSD memory card slot. The quad-core 1.2 GHz Snapdragon 410 chipset will be accompanied by an Adreno 306 GPU, and it seems set for a China release at a yet undisclosed price.
