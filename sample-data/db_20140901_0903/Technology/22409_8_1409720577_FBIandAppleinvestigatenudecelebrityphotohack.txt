FBI and Apple investigate nude celebrity photo hack FBI and Apple investigate nude celebrity photo hack The FBI is investigating last weekend&#8217;s leak of nude photos of several actresses and celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. The shots appeared on 4chan on Sunday, and it currently looks like the poster purloined them from the victims&#8217; iCloud accounts. Apple also says it is actively investigating the incident. Although some of the shots are apparently fakes, Lawrence&#8217;s agent has confirmed that at least some of hers are real. A couple years ago, a Florida man was sentenced to 10 years for hacking nude photos of Scarlett Johansson and others.
