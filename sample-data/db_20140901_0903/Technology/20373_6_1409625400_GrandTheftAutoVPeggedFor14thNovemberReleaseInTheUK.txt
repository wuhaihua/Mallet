Grand Theft Auto V Pegged For 14th November Release In The UK Grand Theft Auto V Pegged For 14th November Release In The UK About a week ago, we reported that it was possible that Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto V for PC and next-gen consoles could be released on the 1st of November. The date might be provisional but now according to Rockstar’s UK retailer, Gem, it seems that they have pegged the game for a release on the 14th of November as you can see in the screenshot above.
However we can’t be 100% sure that this is the correct date, but then again as Gem is Rockstar’s distributor for the UK, we reckon they should know when the games are pegged for a release, right? Also because this is for the UK, it is unclear if the US or other markets will be seeing a similar release date as well, unless of course Rockstar is aiming for a simultaneous release.
Earlier rumors have suggested that the game could be delayed to 2015, however a recent post by Rockstar support has indicated that the game is still on track for a fall release. Rockstar has yet to comment on Gem’s listing so just to be safe, we reckon you guys should probably not hold your breath yet until we hear from the developers officially. In the meantime who else is excited to get their hands on the game for the PC and next-gen consoles?
