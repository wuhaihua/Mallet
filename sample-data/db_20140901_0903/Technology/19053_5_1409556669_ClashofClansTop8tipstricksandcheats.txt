Clash of Clans strategy guide: How to work (and cheat!) your way to faster, bigger, and better wins in Clash of the Clans for iOS!

Gird your loins! Collect your elixir! You call that an upgraded wall? Clash of Clans brings the brazen aggression of Scottish warfare to the addictive and simple mechanics of casual gaming. It's insanely popular, and weâ€™re here to make sure your camp is the toughest to break through, that you're rolling in gold, and that you're climbing the leaderboards.

For those unfamiliar, players in Clash of Clans build forts with gold and elixir resources. Buildings are dragged and dropped however players like, and resources are collected and stored whenever you hop into the game. Over time, they build an army of various troop types. They can be taken on single player missions to raze the villages of nearby goblins, or on raiding parties of neighboring villages. Similarly, other players can raid your town, but don't worry, nothing is permanently destroyed (though they can snatch some of your gold and elixir). Players earn and lose trophies through their multiplayer raids, and band together in clans in order to concentrate their attacks.

It sounds simple, but there's a lot more to it.
