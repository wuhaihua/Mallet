Haier Unveils HaierPad W81 Windows-based Tablet Haier Unveils HaierPad W81 Windows-based Tablet When it comes to tablets, brands such as Apple and Samsung probably come to mind, so we guess you can’t be blamed if you didn’t not exactly think of Haier when it comes to tablets. That being said, it seems that the company has recently taken the wraps off a new Windows-based tablet in the form of the HaierPad W81.
As its name seems to suggest, this will be a Windows-based tablet that seems to run on Windows 8.1. However it will not be of the ARM variety. Instead it will be powered by a quad-core Intel Atom processor, so for those worried about app availability, you should be able to use the same Windows apps on your computer on the tablet.
The HaierPad W81 will also be accompanied by 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. It will also pack an 8-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280&#215;800 and will feature WiFi, Bluetooth, and a microSD card slot for memory expansion. The tablet will be priced at around $280 and is expected to make its way to Europe later this year, although no word on its US availability just yet.
Will Haier be able to succeed where others have failed? Well it’s somewhat low price point should prove to be attractive to some customers, but we guess we’ll just have to wait and see. In the meantime is anyone considering the device for themselves?
