Sidestage Brings Its Musician-booking Platform to London Sidestage Brings Its Musician-booking Platform to London Sidestage, a platform for booking bands, DJs and other musicians for private gigs, is now open to users in London, following an initial launch in Berlin in July.
For the London launch, Sidestage has a handful (around 25, to be precise) of musicians ready to book immediately, with prices ranging from around €120 to more than €15,000 to book the electronic duo Azedia. Interested musicians can pop along to chat with the Sidestage team at its meetup on September 9 in London.

While it’s a potentially useful idea, the company will need to work hard to increase the number of artists offering their services via the platform if it wants to break through into the prime time though – right now, there are only about 80 musicians across both cities.
