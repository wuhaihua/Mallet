BlackBerry Passport Screenshot Shows Off Impressive Battery Life BlackBerry Passport Screenshot Shows Off Impressive Battery Life The BlackBerry Passport is the Canadian company’s upcoming handset and it seems that there is plenty to be excited for. Not only does the handset sport a rather unique design and an interesting keyboard, but according to its specifications, it is also expected to pack an impressive 3,450mAh battery under the hood.
Given that most Android handsets these days fall under the 3,000mAh mark, safe to say that the Passport will most definitely lead the way when it comes to battery life, but exactly how long are we looking at? Well according to N4BB, one of their friends who has the Passport sent in a screenshot of their device.
As you can see in the image above, it shows that despite the phone being at 73%, it has been estimated that there is about 1 day and 8 hours left before it requires a recharge. It’s also interesting to note that despite 6 hours of it being unplugged from its charger, it has only used 27% of its battery.
Of course we can’t be sure if this was when the phone was left idle or if there was some heavy usage, but safe to say that a 3,450mAh battery is pretty big compared to most smartphones these days. So what do you guys think? Anyone planning on picking up the Passport from themselves?
