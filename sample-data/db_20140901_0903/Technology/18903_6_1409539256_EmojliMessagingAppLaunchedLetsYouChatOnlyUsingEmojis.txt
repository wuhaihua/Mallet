Emojli Messaging App Launched, Lets You Chat Only Using Emojis Emojli Messaging App Launched, Lets You Chat Only Using Emojis Back in June, an unusual app called Emojli was announced. For those who are hearing about this for the first time, Emojli is basically an app that only allows users to send messages to one another using Emojis, which for those unfamiliar are those colorful emoticons that you’ve probably seen every now and then in messages you’ve received or seen on the internet.
Well for those who think that the Emojli app is a great idea, you might be pleased to learn that the app has officially launched and you will be able to get your hands on it via the iTunes App Store. Unfortunately it does not appear to be available for Android just yet, but perhaps they might release an Android version later, but for now it will be limited to just iOS.
Now when the app says that it will only let users send messages via Emojis, it takes it one step further as usernames are required to be in Emojis as well. This means that to add your friends, you can’t just search for them via their usual screen names or their real names, but you’ll actually have to figure out what Emoji they used. Unless you’re fluent in Emoji trying to find the right combination could take a while.
We suppose a picture is worth a thousand words so if you think that it could be fun trying to hold conversations with only Emojis, then perhaps Emojli could be the app for you. Any takers?
