It's no secret that Samsung wants to take a big piece of the burgeoning smart home market. 
And who better to tout the advantages of a smart home than an actor well-known for having a relationship with the original smart car. 

David Hasselhoff, playing himself, stars in the ad created by RG/A for Samsung. As Hasselhoff attempts to film an ad for Samsung's Smart Home, another "smart" member of his entourage gets a little jealous. 
Hasselhoff famously played high-tech crime fighter Michael Knight in NBC's Knight Rider back in the 1980s. Knight was assisted by his artificially intelligent car. 
The spot is humorous and shows off the capabilities of a smart home, while playing up Hasselhoff's ability to be tongue-in-cheek about himself and his past characters.
Samsung is expected to show off a bevy of smart home products this week at IFA.
