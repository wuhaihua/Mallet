BSkyB NOW TV Media Streaming App Gets Chromecast Support BSkyB NOW TV Media Streaming App Gets Chromecast Support 



BSkyB is more than happy&nbsp;to offer TV shows, movies, and sports to people living in the United Kingdom and Ireland who are willing to pay. Now the company has bundled Chromecast support into the latest version of its mobile apps. This way customers can take the content they were used to watching on their TVs before switching over to phones or tablets and put it right back on their TVs.

This whole&nbsp;process may sound&nbsp;unnecessary, but there's something to be said for said ignoring the bulkiness of a cable box to deal with the convenience of an app that supplies shows on demand.&nbsp;Chromecast support lets users who have been drawn away to their mobile devices return that content right back to the largest screen in the house where it feels most at home.
Given that most of the AP team lives in the US, we aren't able to test this functionality out for you. But to our friends on the other side of the pond, by all means, hit up the app below and share with us your experience.
