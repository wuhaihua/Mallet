Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A Now Available For $749 Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A Now Available For $749 A few months ago, Samsung announced their first QHD smartphone in the form of the Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A. The device was basically the Galaxy S5 except that it featured a QHD display resolution and also came with support for LTE-A networks. Now the good news is that if you’ve been eyeing the handset but were a bit bummed by its South Korean exclusivity, you might be pleased to learn that it is available from 28mobile.com.
Now the handset will be priced pretty expensive at $749 and given that it is not officially offered by any local carrier, it means that the phone will have to be bought outright as opposed to bought via a contract. For those who enjoy having the freedom of choice, we guess this is a good thing, although that means you’d have to pay a lot of money upfront.
There is also a good chance that the LTE-A functionality will not be applicable in the US due to the different radios so essentially you will be just buying the phone for its display. However we should point out that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has been confirmed to feature a QHD display. Granted its larger display would mean its pixel density is lower, but unless you can actually tell the difference, perhaps waiting for the Galaxy Note 4 could be a better idea.
