								Snapdeal has launched Teewe &#8211; a Chromecast-like dongle that can stream media from the Internet to your TV. Just like Google&#8217;s Chromecast, Teewe works by hooking it to your TV&#8217;s HDMI port and is controlled by an smartphone app. Snapdeal&#8217;s Teewe dongle is priced at Rs 1999.
&nbsp;
Teewe lets users stream content from the web such as YouTube videos, and also access movies, photos and music stored on your PC once connected to the same Wi-Fi network. The device is controlled by the Teewe app that has to be downloaded on your phone before playing content on your TV.
&nbsp;
The app gets data from your phone, YouTube and other media saved on your laptop. The app lets you control the sound, play and and pause videos. There&#8217;s also a &#8216;TV shows&#8217; section that lets you catch up on the TV shows you&#8217;ve missed. Snapdeal says that the device works withÂ Android and iOS,Windows and Mac operating systems.
&nbsp;
The dongle is powered by a dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor clocked at 1.5GHz and a DDR 3 RAM of 1GB. Snapdeal is also giving an HDMI extension cable and a micro-USB charger along with the Teewe dongle. Here&#8217;s how it works:


The device has been developed by Bangalore-based MangoMan Consumer Electronics and Teewe is the company&#8217;s flagship product.
