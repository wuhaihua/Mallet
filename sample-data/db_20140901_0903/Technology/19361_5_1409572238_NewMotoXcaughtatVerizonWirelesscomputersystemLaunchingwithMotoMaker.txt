New Moto X caught at Verizon Wireless computer system; Launching with Moto Maker? New Moto X caught at Verizon Wireless computer system; Launching with Moto Maker? Motorola will be announcing new products on Thursday, September 4th when we hope to see the successor of its wildly popular Moto X smartphone. The rumored Moto X+1 has been apparently caught at Verizon Wireless computer system, hinting us that the Big Red carrier is readying to jump on the opportunity as soon as the phone is officially official.
Earlier we&#8217;ve heard that the Moto X+1 will be available in few different colors, including black, white and bamboo. Now we&#8217;re hearing that the updated Moto Maker could launch alongside the new phone.
What&#8217;s not clear though is whether Verizon will score the exclusive right to offer Moto customizations. We would like to see that capability available across the board, but we&#8217;re not the one pulling the strings here.
In any case, we should get all the missing pieces of this puzzle in the next few days. Hopefully, the American handset maker, now part of Lenovo Group, will be quick to bring its baby to users all around the world. After all, this device has the &#8220;bestseller&#8221; sign written all over it, and yes &#8211; we want to try it out as soon as that&#8217;s possible.
