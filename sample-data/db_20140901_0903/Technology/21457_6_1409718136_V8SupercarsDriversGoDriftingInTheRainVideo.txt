V8 Supercars Drivers Go Drifting In The Rain: Video V8 Supercars Drivers Go Drifting In The Rain: Video A rainy race track usually isn't a very fun place. Sure, some people excel at racing in the rain but others would rather see a shining sun in the sky and full slicks at each corner. This wasn't the case recently when the Australian V8 Supercars crew showed up at Sydney Motorsport Park for a test day ahead of the SMP 400. The track was wet, grip was minimal, yet the action on the track... was high.
If you're not already aware, V8 Supercars is one of the best racing series on the entire planet. The drivers are aggressive, the cars are loud and fast, and the racing is truly top notch. During the wet test day, drivers Shane van Gisbergen, Chaz Mostert, and Jamie Whincup all had a bit of fun before bringing the cars into the pits.
It's not exactly Formula Drift, but seeing these V8 Supercars running sideways through some of the turns is a pretty excellent sight. It's especially interesting because it gives you a glimpse into just how much camber the cars are running up front.
Watch the lead car of van Gisbergen right around the 40-second mark to see what I mean.
