HTC doubles Google Drive storage for One, Max, and Remix HTC doubles Google Drive storage for One, Max, and Remix If you&#8217;re trying to choose between this year&#8217;s powerful options for your latest device, perhaps HTC can sway you with its latest addition to its HTC Advantage program. Now, whenever you purchase an HTC One M8, Max, or Remix, you will get 100 GB of Google Drive storage for free. Upon activating the device, simply open the preloaded Google Drive app and press redeem. Google has said that the Desire 826 and 610 will also be eligible for the extra large storage. For those of you that have already activated your free 50 GB of storage, you are still able to get your next 50 GB free. Howeverm if you still have last year&#8217;s HTC One or Mini, you&#8217;ll unfortunately be stuck with 25 GB of Drive storage still.Source: HTCVia: Android Police
