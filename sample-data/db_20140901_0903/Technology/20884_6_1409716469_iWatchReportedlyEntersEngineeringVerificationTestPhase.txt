iWatch Reportedly Enters “Engineering Verification” Test Phase iWatch Reportedly Enters “Engineering Verification” Test Phase The rumors regarding the iWatch are a little confusing at the moment. Some of the rumors claim that the iWatch will be announced alongside the iPhone 6 on the 9th of September, while some claim that we might only be hearing about it in 2015. There is also a happy middle in which the rumors claim the iWatch will be announced in September but might only be available next year.
That being said, a new report from DigiTimes is claiming that the device is still being manufactured. They claim that their sources have revealed to them that the iWatch is in its engineering verification test phase right now and will have to enter production verification testing before it is mass produced.
DigiTimes goes on to state that this means that the device will most likely be shipped in 2015 and asserts that the iWatch will not be making an appearance at the 9th of September event that Apple will be holding. Given that DigiTimes has had a pretty spotty record when it comes to Apple-related rumors, perhaps it’s best taken with a grain of salt for now.
In any case we guess more will be revealed on the 9th of September so if you’d like to learn more about the iPhone 6 and hopefully the iWatch, do check back with us then for the details!
