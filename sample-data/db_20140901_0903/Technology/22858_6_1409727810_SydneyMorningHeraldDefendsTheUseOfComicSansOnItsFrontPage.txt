Sydney Morning Herald Defends The Use Of Comic Sans On Its Front Page Sydney Morning Herald Defends The Use Of Comic Sans On Its Front Page 
&#8220;Comic Sans was the right choice.&#8221; That&#8217;s the line that the Sydney Morning Herald&#8216;s executive editor Matt Martel has gone with, and that&#8217;s the one he&#8217;s sticking to. The internet&#8217;s most hated font appeared on the front page of the paper this morning, and the internet melted down.
I probably don&#8217;t have time to explain what a &#8220;newspaper&#8221; is to you young people, but safe to say that it&#8217;s like this website, just a few hours older when you read it. For what it&#8217;s worth: Fairfax Media is the parent of Allure Media, who publishes Gizmodo Australia, so it hurts to sledge our distant relatives over there are the SMH, but they&#8217;ve brought it on themselves.
This morning, the Sydney Morning Herald ran a story with loads of excellent information about the developments surrounding the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into the New South Wales Liberal Party which has already claimed a Premier and other prominent politicians and frontbenchers.
The problem was that the image used to illustrate the story featured shoddy clip-art speech bubbles and the internet&#8217;s most hated font: Comic Sans.
After the backlash, Matt Martel &#8212; the man who admits to sneaking font purchases onto the company credit card &#8212; decided it would be a good idea to front up to the world and talk about the decision.
In an opinion piece on the use of the internet&#8217;s most hated font in the print edition, Martel wrote:

I have come to terms with Comic Sans. It is like an aged uncle who drinks a bit too much, doesn&#8217;t wash enough and is a tad too informal at weddings and funerals. He wears a Hawaiian shirt when he should wear something more formal.
&#8230;
It has its place, and that place is firmly not on the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald. Not even in the classifieds. Not anywhere.
&#8230;
Except today. Chris Hartcher&#8217;s and Eric Roozendaal&#8217;s comments to the ICAC were treated typographically with the respect they deserve. And they deserved Comic Sans.
&#8230;
Comic Sans is here. It is not going away. It has its place. Let&#8217;s hope that we don&#8217;t feel the need to shame anyone else with a font for a while.

We&#8217;ve already talked about whether or not you can defend Comic Sans, and I guess if you&#8217;re Martel, you can. You can read the full defence of Comic Sans in our newspapers here, and watch Martel back the decision (albeit through gritted teeth) as well. [Sydney Morning Herald]
