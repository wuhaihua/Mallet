BERLIN — It seems that September is the right time to launch a small tablet. We've already seen two here in Berlin, and the 2014 IFA tech conference hasn't even properly started yet. 
After Lenovo's Tab 8, Asus took the stage with its MeMO Pad 7. 

It's a 7-inch tablet with a Full HD IPS screen and a quad-core Intel Atom Z3560 processor. It has a 5-megapixel rear camera (and a 2-megapixel one up front), LTE connectivity and runs on Android 4.4 KitKat.
Made of fiberglass with a duralumin frame, the device is not exceptionally thin — 8.3mm — but it's very light, weighing a mere 269 grams.  
The Asus MeMO Pad 7 will be available in three colors — Rose Champagne, Gentle Black and Burgundy Red — for the price of 199 euros in Europe.
