AMD Announces Three New FX-8000 Series Eight-core Processors, New Pricing AMD Announces Three New FX-8000 Series Eight-core Processors, New Pricing AMD made three additions to its FX-8300 series eight-core socket AM3+ processors, along with adjustments to the series' overall pricing. The company launched a new performance-segment part, the FX-8370, along with two energy-efficient eight-core chips, the FX-8370E, and the FX-8320E. The FX-8370 features the same 4.00 GHz nominal clock speed as the FX-8350, but a tiny bit higher TurboCore frequency of 4.30 GHz, compared to the latter's 4.20 GHz. This chip is priced at US $199.

The FX-8370E, on the other hand, features the same maximum TurboCore frequency of 4.30, but its nominal clock speed is much lower, at 3.30 GHz. Not all cores run at TurboCore frequency simultaneously. The FX-8320E features a maximum TurboCore frequency of 4.00 GHz, same as that of the FX-8320, but a lower nominal clock speed, of 3.20 GHz. Both these two parts feature rated TDP of 95W, compared to 125W of the other parts in the series. 
With the introduction of these three parts, AMD came up with an all new pricing scheme. The top-end FX-9590 is now priced at US $230, competitive with the Core i5-4690K. It's followed by the FX-9370, priced at $211. These two 220W TDP chips are supported on a limited number of AM3+ motherboards, owing to their high power requirements. Next up, is the FX-8370 at $199, the FX-8350 at a new $180 price tag, making it a compelling alternative to the likes of Core i5-4440, and the FX-8320, at an attractive $150.
