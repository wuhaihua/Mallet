2016 Volvo XC90 Live Photos And Video 2016 Volvo XC90 Live Photos And Video Volvo’s second-generation XC90 finally made its debut at an event in Stockholm, Sweden last week, and these are our first live photos of the all-new SUV direct from its premiere. The original XC90 was launched in 2002, and it revolutionized the SUV segment with its combination of space, versatility and safety. Volvo is keen to repeat that success, and from what we’ve seen the automaker may just pull it off.
The new XC90, which arrives next spring as a 2016 model, is thoroughly modern and this time around features a host of luxury touches that should make even the German premium brands nervous. The vehicle is the first to be based on Volvo’s all-new SPA modular platform and is unique in that it comes exclusively with four-cylinder powertrains, with the most powerful variant, the T8, supplemented with hybrid technology.
This technology, plus the styling you see here, paves the way for a whole new generation of Volvo models to be launched within the next five years. In fact, we already know of eight additional Volvo models in the pipeline.“This is one of the most important days in our history,” Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said at the new XC90’s launch. “We are not just launching a car, but re-launching our brand—the XC90 paves the way for a portfolio of exciting new cars to come in the following years.”
Key elements of the design include the T-shaped daytime running lights (nicknamed Thor’s Hammer after the weapon used by the famous Norse god of thunder and lightning); a much bolder interpretation of the Volvo grille and iron mark logo; muscular contour lines; and tribal tattoo-like rear lights. To add more visual muscle from the sides, the XC90 also comes with a range of wheel sizes up to 22 inches.
Inside, you’ll find the most luxurious cabin to be fitted to a Volvo in the automaker’s 87 years of history. There are still seven seats, but the most striking feature is a tablet-like touchscreen display in the center of the dash, which forms the heart of Volvo’s next-generation infotainment system. The system is virtually button free and not only controls vehicle functions but also a range of internet-based products and services.For the U.S. market, the primary powertrain will be a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with both supercharging and turbo technology. It will be called the T6 and rate in at 316 horsepower. The more powerful T8 model will feature a similar engine combined with plug-in hybrid tech to boost output to a V-8-like 400 hp. Other markets will get some diesels as well.
Full details on 2016 Volvo XC90 pricing will be announced at a later date, but a well-equipped XC90 T6 with all-wheel drive will have a starting price of $48,900. Standard goodies will include 19-inch wheels, navigation, a panoramic sunroof and a host of connectivity features._______________________________________Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
