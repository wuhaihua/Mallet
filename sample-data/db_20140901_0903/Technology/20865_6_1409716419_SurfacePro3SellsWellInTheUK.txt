Surface Pro 3 Sells Well In The UK Surface Pro 3 Sells Well In The UK The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 has certainly gone through quite a bit of adventure on the news front recently, especially when one takes into consideration the alleged overheating issues that Microsoft has already promised a fix for it. Still, the business class tablet has been released in another 25 more markets recently, and word has it that the Surface Pro 3 is doing pretty well for itself over in the U.K. 
In fact, it does look as though just about every store location in the United Kingdom has run out of their current Surface Pro 3 stock. Is this due to extremely high demand, or basically there is very little stock sent out in the first place by the folks over at Microsoft to test out the new markets? 
It seems like stores such as Currys and Argos are more or less sold out of every single configuration of the Surface Pro 3 imaginable, and perhaps Currys’ move of putting up a £100 discount when it comes to laptops and similar devices made the Surface Pro 3 all the more appealing. Hopefully Microsoft will move swift enough to solve this problem, which is a good problem to have in the first place. Are you willing to give the Surface Pro 3 a go yourself?
