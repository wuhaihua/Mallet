iPhone 6 Pre-Order Date Pegged For 19th September By Dutch Carrier iPhone 6 Pre-Order Date Pegged For 19th September By Dutch Carrier While Apple has confirmed that they will be hosting an event on the 9th of September where presumably the iPhone 6 will be launched, we guess the question that remains is when will Apple release the phone? Previously it had been rumored that it would be released on the 19th of September and now thanks to a report from Dutch website iPhonez.nl (via Cult of Mac), they have “confirmed” that the 19th of September could be a possible date as well.
They claim that one Dutch carrier (it was not named) would begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 6 starting from the 19th of September. This seems to be in line with Apple’s release schedule which is usually a couple of weeks after the iPhone has been officially announced. For example in 2013, Apple announced their new iPhones on the 10th of September but officially released them on the 20th of September.
That being said, the report notes that the carrier’s backend system does not list two types of iPhone models. This seems to corroborate earlier rumors that suggested that Apple might have some production issues with the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 that would cause it to be launched at a later date. It is unclear if the 5.5-inch model will be announced first and released later, or if it would skip the 9th of September announcement entirely.
Either way take it with a grain of salt for now because for all we know, the Dutch carrier could simply be following the rumors and have marked the 19th of September as a placeholder date, but do check back with us on the 9th of September for all the official details!
