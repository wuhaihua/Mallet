Mystery (Partially) Solved: Stonehenge Was A Complete Circle Mystery (Partially) Solved: Stonehenge Was A Complete Circle 
One of the mysteries of Stonehenge has been solved because someone was too lazy to get a longer hose.

Usually, the grass around the puzzling collection of Neolithic stones is watered by stewards, but this year, the hose used was too short, and didn&#8217;t reach the entire grounds. The unwatered grass dried out. It looked gnarly, but the barren land ended up showing archeologists the answer to a lingering question: Whether Stonehenge was actually supposed to be an incomplete circle.
Tim Daw, who works on the grounds, first noticed parches revealing &#8220;stone holes&#8221; as he surveyed the dried-out area. These holes confirmed that Stonehenge, at one point, had been a full circle.
&#8220;I called my colleague over and he saw them and realised their possible significance as well. Not being archaeologists we called in the professionals to evaluate them,&#8221; Daw told Telegraph.
&#8220;I am still amazed and very pleased that simply really looking at something, that tens of thousands of people had unwittingly seen, can reveal secrets that sophisticated machinery can&#8217;t.&#8221;
This doesn&#8217;t mean Stonehenge is now short on unanswered questions. We still don&#8217;t know who built it, or why (though a theory that it&#8217;s a giant musical instrument has gained some traction). And now there&#8217;s another puzzle: What happened to the stones that used to complete the circle?
