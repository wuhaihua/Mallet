The Leica MP Titanium Can Be Yours For $40,000 The Leica MP Titanium Can Be Yours For $40,000 As if Leica cameras weren’t expensive enough, it seems that someone out there thought it would be a great idea if they could make it more expensive. This was done through a remake of the Leica MP which has been crafted in titanium, and given how expensive the Leica MP was, at least to casual photographers, it turns out the titanium edition will cost a great deal more at $40,000.
We should point out that the camera was released back in 2007 as a way to commemorate the 1st anniversary of the opening of the Leica Store in Ginza, Tokyo. However at the time of its release, the camera was made exclusive to Japan, meaning that if you wanted to get your hands on one you’d either have to fly down to Japan to buy it, or hope that someone will buy it and resell it.
The good news is that while you can pick one up for yourself via eBay, the Leica Store Miami has one in stock so if you’re in the vicinity why not pop over and check it out? The camera purportedly weighs less than the original Leica MP, presumably thanks to the use of titanium. The exterior parts of the camera and fittings are made from titanium and even the body cap and ISO selector are made from titanium, so safe to say this is one heck of a premium product.
Other than that, the camera’s specs will remain pretty much the same as the original Leica MP, just that it has been crafted with a titanium body. We’re not sure how many of you guys are willing to drop $40,000 for the camera, but boy does it look pretty!
