Lexus F Series Won’t Add Hybrids, Yet Lexus F Series Won’t Add Hybrids, Yet 
With many of the world’s automakers jaunting down the avenue of high-performance hybridization, the Lexus F series looks to remain hybrid-free for the time being, according to new reports.
Australia’s Motoring sat down with Yukuhiro Yaguchi, chief engineer at the Lexus F division, who discussed the obvious emissions benefits of hybridization as well as its pitfalls in a performance- and track-oriented car.


“In order to put the hybrid on track they need a little more development as far as track driving,” noted Yaguchi. “If we use the current configuration hybrid we will drain the battery so fast we will need to have a capacitor to generate the electricity fast.”
Super-capacitor technology blazoned by Toyota Motorsport GmbH in the WEC-fighting TS040 racecar would offer Lexus a fast track to performance hybridization, but Yaguchi maintains that its development for road-going operation takes time.


“We are currently studying the application,” assured Yaguchi. “We are studying the data coming from the TS040 and we can’t say it will never make it into a production car.”
Doublespeak or not, it certainly leaves the topic open for discussion in regards to a range-topping Lexus F plug-in.
The F series, which already squares off against BMW’s M division, could launch punches at the all-new BMW i8 plug-in with a hybridized version of the RC F, or for that matter at cross-town rival Honda with the upcoming and supposedly hybrid-equipped S2000.
