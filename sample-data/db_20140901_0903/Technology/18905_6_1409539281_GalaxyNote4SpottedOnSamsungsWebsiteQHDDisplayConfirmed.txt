This would make it Samsung’s second smartphone to sport such a display, although it would be the first to be available around the world (the Galaxy S5 LTE-A was limited to South Korea).
That being said, is a QHD display a reality or just a pipe dream? Well for those who are a bit skeptical, hopefully this will clear your doubts. It seems that some details of the upcoming Galaxy Note 4 have been spotted on Samsung’s website via its UAProf. According to the UAProf, it lists the display of the Galaxy Note 4 as 2560&#215;1440, effectively giving it a QHD display as previously rumored.
This is good news for would-be Galaxy Note 4 customers who are hoping that Samsung would step up its display resolution for the South Korean tech giant’s second flagship for 2014. Given that Samsung’s display are usually pretty good already, we can only imagine that the higher resolution will help make the display look even sharper.

In the meantime are you excited that the Galaxy Note 4 will pack a QHD display, or was Full HD good enough for you to begin with?
