Moto X+1 Caught On Video, Several Features Detailed Moto X+1 Caught On Video, Several Features Detailed 
According to an earlier leak, the alleged Moto X+1 was spotted in the flesh. While photos are great, we guess videos would be even better as they would allow us to see more angles of the device, and if a video was what you were after, the folks at TK Tech News (via Pocket Now) have recently released a video that shows off the handset a bit more.
Now if there is one thing the video points out, it is that the flash unit of the Moto X+1 is apparently around the camera lens itself, which you can check out in the video above and if you were to take a closer look at it. We’re not sure how this will work out and if the flash might interfere with the actual image, but we guess we’ll just have to wait and find out for ourselves.
The Motorola logo below the camera is also apparently the power button to the device, although once again we have to wonder if it might interfere with the operation of the phone as it could be easily pressed due to its placement. The video also shows off what appears to be a metal trim around the phone which we have to admit is a nice touch.
Now there are various sensors that can be seen on the front of the phone. It is unclear what they are for, but some have speculated that perhaps they could be used for the rumored 3D user interface of the phone, which is in line with earlier rumors that suggested that the phone could sport a 3D UI much like Amazon’s Fire Phone.
In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but with Motorola holding an event on the 4th of September, we guess we won’t have to wait too long to find out what’s real and what’s not.
