Apple Rumored To Have Partnered With Nordstrom For Mobile Payments Apple Rumored To Have Partnered With Nordstrom For Mobile Payments Word on the street is that Apple is getting ready to launch their own mobile payment services on the 9th of September alongside the iPhone 6. Now in terms of supported methods of payments, it seems that Apple has managed to get companies such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express on board.
However what good is a mobile payments service if retailers won’t accept your standards, right? Now for those who are wondering who are some of Apple’s potential partners, the folks at Bank Innovation (via AppleInsider) are reporting that Nordstrom could be one of them. They claim that Apple and Nordstrom have reportedly struck up a deal in which the latter will accept Apple’s mobile payments system.
Nordstrom employees have claimed that the company have recently upgraded its iPod POS hardware a few weeks ago, suggesting that the upgrades could have included support for Apple’s upcoming iPhone models which is said to sport NFC that will help facilitate these mobile payments.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about companies trying to establish standards when it comes to mobile payments. For the most part we guess it will be up to Apple to convince retailers that their system is the way to go, and whether or not Apple will be successful where others have failed remains to be seen, but what say you? Do you think Apple’s chances are better?
