Nearly Complete iPhone 6 Assembled From Parts Compared to iPhone 5s in New Video Nearly Complete iPhone 6 Assembled From Parts Compared to iPhone 5s in New Video Last week, a video from Feld & Volk depicted a nearly complete 4.7-inch iPhone 6 that was assembled from various iPhone 6 parts, giving us a clear picture of what the finished device might look like ahead of its September 9 debut.

A second video has surfaced from Russian YouTube channel Rozetked (via 9to5Mac), depicting another near-complete 4.7-inch iPhone 6 next to an iPhone 5s. Like the iPhone 6 from Feld & Volk, the iPhone 6 depicted in the video appears to have been assembled from various iPhone parts, showing off a space gray rear shell with both a black and white front plate.


In the video, the iPhone 6 is displayed next to the iPhone 5s at several different angles, showing off all of the design differences between the two phones. Aside from the iPhone 6's larger size, it is also noticeably thinner with iPad-style design elements including pill-shaped volume buttons and rounded corners.

Also shown is the device's rounded True Tone dual-LED flash, protruding camera ring, thick antenna bands, embedded Apple logo, and relocated power button, along with internal elements like the logic board.

Apple is expected to introduce both the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 devices at a September 9 media event. While rumors have suggested the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will be available to ship shortly after its debut, it is less clear whether the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will also ship during the month of September or at a later date due to production issues.

The September 9 event is also expected to feature the introduction of Apple's first wearable device and it may also include the debut of Apple's rumored mobile payment service.Related roundups: iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6
