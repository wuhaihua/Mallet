V-12-Powered Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG On Its Way For 2016: Report V-12-Powered Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG On Its Way For 2016: Report If you thought the G63 AMG wasn’t badass enough, wait until the G65 AMG hits the scene in 2016. The V-12 brute has been on sale elsewhere since 2012 but a new report claims we’ll be seeing it introduced to local showrooms for the 2016 model year.
According to Automotive News (subscription required), the G65 AMG will be priced higher than $250,000 when it lands. This makes sense because the vehicle in Germany is priced from 264,180 euros ($346,431) with taxes.
Although that may seem steep, the G65 AMG is the most powerful SUV currently in production. The vehicle packs Mercedes-AMG’s twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V-12 found in the likes of the SL65 AMG and S65 AMG—and most recently in the S65 AMG Coupe. In the G-Class-based G65 AMG, the mighty motor is tuned to deliver 612 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque.
Drive in the G65 AMG goes to all four wheels via a seven-speed automatic, and accelerating to 62 mph from rest takes just 5.3 seconds—not bad for a vehicle that weighs almost 6,000 pounds. Top speed is limited to 143 mph._______________________________________Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
