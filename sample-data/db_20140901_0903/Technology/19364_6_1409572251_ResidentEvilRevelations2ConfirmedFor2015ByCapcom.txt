Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Confirmed For 2015 By Capcom Resident Evil: Revelations 2 Confirmed For 2015 By Capcom About a couple of weeks ago, an image for Resident Evil: Revelations 2 was spotted. The art was meant for a Xbox 360 cover which seemed to suggest that Capcom could be working on a new Resident Evil game that would be headed for current-gen consoles. Well if you were wondering, wonder no more because Capcom has officially announced the game.
The company announced that Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is expected to see a release in early 2015. It was revealed at Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asiaâ€™s press conference where it revealed that the game would be arriving on the PlayStation platform in addition to the Xbox 360.
Unfortunately there was no mention as to whether the game will be arriving on other platforms or next-gen consoles, but hopefully more will be revealed later. There was also no mention of a launch of the Nintendo Wii U which is a bit odd given that the first Revelations game was released on the Wii U as well.
Capcom also revealed that the game will feature a brand new story and setting and will not be bringing back characters such as Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine. Instead they announced that new characters will be added to the game.
