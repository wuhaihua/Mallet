Possible Moto X+1 Prototype With Leather Backplate Spotted Possible Moto X+1 Prototype With Leather Backplate Spotted One of the key features of the Moto X isn’t so much its hardware, but its customizability that allowed users to create a phone that suits their aesthetic preferences. Motorola also threw in some interesting material choices, such as wood, which allowed the device to look and feel different from the competition.
Now one of the new options for the Moto X+1 has been rumored to be leather and thanks to a recent photo by TK Tech News, an alleged image of the Moto X+1 with a leather backplate has surfaced. It’s a bit hard to tell that it’s leather but according to the post, it is, although we guess you should probably take it with a grain of salt for now.
We should point out out that there is a good chance that the phone in the photo could be an early prototype of the Moto X+1. This is because the handset seems to be missing a flash unit for the camera. Considering that all flagship smartphones these days come with flash units for the camera, we reckon it would be Motorola/Lenovo would be remiss if they didn’t include it in the device.
Alternatively the photo we are looking at could be a fake as well. Like we said take it with a grain of salt for now, but hopefully we will learn more during Motorola’s announcement on the 4th of September.
