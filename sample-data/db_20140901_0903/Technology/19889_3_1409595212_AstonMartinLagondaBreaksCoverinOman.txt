Aston Martin Lagonda Breaks Cover in Oman Aston Martin Lagonda Breaks Cover in Oman 
As far as new car teasers go, the Aston Martin Lagonda reveal wasn’t particularly spectacular.
A pre-production version of Aston’s revitalized Lagonda was recently flown to Muscat, Oman, to take part in hot weather testing. That afforded the world a glimpse of the marque’s new super-saloon … albeit attached to a shipping dolly.

Described by Aston Martin as &#8220;exceptional automotive art,&#8221; the Lagonda will be sold exclusively to Middle East customers on an invitation-only basis and in extremely limited numbers. Sorry Hollywood.
Built by Aston Martin’s high-lux Q division – the folks responsible for the CC100 Speedster and V12 Vantage S Q – the Lagonda will likely boast the firm’s big 6.0-liter V12, which it will share with the four-door Rapide S as well as its VH vehicle architecture.


Considering the rarity of this Lagonda reboot, power output should match and exceed the Rapide S’ 552-horsepower and 4.2 second jaunt from zero to 60 mph. The eight-speed automatic transmission found in the Rapide is also pegged to port over.
