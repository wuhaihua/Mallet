Nokia Eyeing Return To Consumer Business Nokia Eyeing Return To Consumer Business With Nokia’s mobile division having been sold off to Microsoft, what will Nokia do with itself? We’ve heard some rumors that Nokia could be eyeing the consumer market again and could break in with Android devices, something which Microsoft swiftly put an end to, and also wearable devices under their HERE brand.
That being said, Nokia’s CEO Rajeev Suri has recently given an interview with the Economic Times of India in which he revealed the company’s desire to move back to the B-to-C (business to consumer) business, as opposed to merely being a player who remains in the background.
According to Suri, “Maybe, we will do something else that will relate to the B-to-C business.” Suri also goes on to state that they’ve had some success in the consumer market with the Z Launcher, which for those unfamiliar is an Android launcher made by Nokia. Suri stated that so far they have managed to get over 100,000 activations during its beta phase.
“We just launched a Z launcher – a predictive app on Android devices, which got 100,000 activations when it was a beta.That’s (B-2-C) an area where we want to move fast, fail, learn and move forward to new products.” Who knows, perhaps Nokia’s future Android devices could be launched with Z Launcher as the default, but in the meantime are you excited to see Nokia return to the consumer business side of things?
