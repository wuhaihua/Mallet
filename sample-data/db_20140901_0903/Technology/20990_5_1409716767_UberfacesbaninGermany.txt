Uber faces ban in Germany Uber faces ban in Germany 

A court in Frankfurt has ruled that Uber cannot operate in Germany due to a lack of adequate insurance for these types of private drivers, as well as expensive licensing. Low-cost UberPop drivers found to continue operating could face fines up to 250,000 euros per trip, though Uber says they intend to keep them running through the ban.



Uber has remained confident that their insurance applies to drivers, and fully intends to appeal this preliminary injunction. An Uber spokesperson said:


  "Germany is one of the fastest growing markets for Uber in Europe. We will continue to operate in Germany and will appeal the recent lawsuit filed by Taxi Deutschland in Frankfurt. You cannot put the brakes on progress. Uber will continue its operations and will offer UberPop ridesharing services via its app throughout Germany."


Do you guys use Uber often? Should ridesharing apps like Uber be regulated just as heavily as taxis?
