Chinese Manufacturers Look To Windows 8.1 Tablets Chinese Manufacturers Look To Windows 8.1 Tablets When it comes to the world of tablets, I am quite sure that many of us are familiar with the all conquering iPad from Apple, which does not look as though it is going to relinquish its throne anytime soon. Apart from that, there has also been a slew of Android-powered tablets that were introduced over the years, but what on the Windows front? Well, two Chinese manufacturers intend to add more zip to the world of Windows-powered tablets, where Cube and Ramos have unveiled 7” tablets that will be powered by Intel Atom Bay Trail processors and Windows 8.1 as the operating system of choice.
First of all, the Cube iWork 7 will come with a 7” IPS display at 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, run on a quad-core Intel Atom Z3735G processor, has 1GB RAM, and 16GB of internal memory. Apart from that, it will also boast of HDMI output, carries a rear camera as well as a front-facing shooter for selfie lovers, with an 8-hour battery life rating, all of it crammed into a chassis that is no more than 0.25” thin while tipping the scales at approximately 10 ounces. 
As for Ramos, there will be a slew of new tablets that will arrive on the market soon, as it features 7”, 8.9”, and 10” models &#8211; with a choice of either Android or Windows 8.1 as the operating system of choice. The Ramos i7s happens to be the smallest of the lot, and it does share similar specifications as those found on the Cube iWork 7, albeit sporting a thicker form factor at 0.35”. Will they ever arrive in the US? Probably not, but chances are you can pick them up online if you really want to have a go.
