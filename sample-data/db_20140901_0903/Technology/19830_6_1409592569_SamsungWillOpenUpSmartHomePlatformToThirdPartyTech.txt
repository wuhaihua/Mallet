Samsung Will Open Up Smart Home Platform To Third Party Tech Samsung Will Open Up Smart Home Platform To Third Party Tech 
Home automation is a trend that&#8217;s catching on these days. Manufacturers and developers are creating hardware and software which bring control for connected objects to a user&#8217;s smartphone, tablet or wearable device. Samsung has come up with several products under its Smart Home program and now its looking towards an expansion which will include technology from third party partners.

Samsung says that the new range of products and services have been designed to &#8220;increase home safety, improve energy management, adapt to in-home location.&#8221; Moreover they&#8217;ll also allow users to control all of the connected device through voice, so turning off a light bulb becomes as easy as simply saying it out loud.
The company hasn&#8217;t revealed yet which companies or services it will be teaming up with to expanding its Smart Home platform, we might have to wait until IFA 2014 to find out who its joining forces with. A software development kit or SDK will be released to developers later this year as well, allowing them to add command and control features for connected objects to their applications.
Its no surprise to see Samsung lay down its plans for advancing in the home automation space. This comes after its recent acquisition of SmartThings, which created a leading open platform for connected devices and the Internet of Things. Samsung is also a member of the Thread consortium which aims to come up with standards for connected devices.
