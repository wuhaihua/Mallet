iPhone 6 Weekend Launch Sales To Be Lower Than Expected [Analyst] iPhone 6 Weekend Launch Sales To Be Lower Than Expected [Analyst] Whether you’re a fan or critic of Apple, we’re sure that most of you guys are at the very least curious to see what Apple has up their sleeves come 9th of September which is when Apple is expected to announce their new iPhone, the iPhone 6. Apple’s iPhones tend to sell pretty well during its launch weekend, however according to analyst Gene Munster, he predicts the opposite.
According to Munster, he believes that sales of the iPhone 6 during its launch weekend could be lower than expected. He estimates that Apple might only be able to shift 6.5 million new iPhone 6 units during the weekend, which unfortunately would be a decrease of 28% from 2013 in which Apple managed to sell 9 million units during the launch of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c.
Oddly enough despite Munster’s somewhat gloomy outlook on weekend sales, he has raised his target price on AAPL up from $105 to $120. To be fair his opinion is only for the weekend sales and not the long term profitability of Apple. We’re not sure why Munster seems to believe that sales won’t be too hot during the opening weekend.
Perhaps it could be that iPhone owners might be holding back on purchasing the 4.7-inch model if they know that a 5.5-inch model would be released a few months later. It could also be that a possible launch of the iWatch could put iPhone purchases on hold, with customers opting to spend their money on Apple’s latest wearable instead of the phone. Either way we guess we’ll just have to wait and see, but what do you guys think?
