								Ahead of IFA 2014, many manufacturers are already unveiling their products for the first time before their main events as the show begins later today. Lenovo, which will be presenting its new product line-up on Thursday, has outed its first-ever 8-inch Intel Atom-powered Android tablet, dubbed the Tab S8. The Lenovo Tab S8 has been priced very much in Nexus 7 territory at $199 (roughly Rs. 12,000) and could very well have a similar-sized Nexus tablet to compete with if the rumoured HTC Nexus tablet pans out.

Striking in yellow
The Tab S8 looks quite good and is actually crammed with top-shelf specs, which is a great thing given the price. It runs Android 4.4 KitKat out-of-the-box, and sports an 8-inch full HD WUXGA (1920&#215;1200 pixel resolution) IPS display. That 16:10 ratio should be great for viewing movies and for surfing as well. Under the hood is a powerful sounding combination of quad-core 64-bit Intel Atom Z3745 Bay Trail processor  with 1.33GHz base clock, up to 1.86GHz with Intel Burst Performance Technology and 2GB of RAM. It really does sound delicious the entire combination and if and when Android L hits this device it will be able to fully support the 64-bit software thanks to the Bay Trail part.

8MP camera on the back
Tab S8 has 16GB of inbuilt storage but sadly no expandable storage. It sports an 8-megapixel autofocus camera (f/2.2 lens) on the back, along with an LED flash, while a 1.6-megapixel HD fixed focus camera takes care of selfies and video calls. Connectivity-wise Lenovo has added LTE Wi-Fi b/g/n, and Bluetooth 4.0. Finally, there&#8217;s a non-removable 4290mAh Li-ion battery, which is rated for 7 hours of usage and up to 400 hours of standby time.

Premium plastic build

The tablet features dual front-facing speakers powered by Dolby Audio sound enhancement technology and we are really digging the canary yellow colour option.
