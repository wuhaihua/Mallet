Samsung Galaxy Note Edge to be unveiled alongside Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note Edge to be unveiled alongside Galaxy Note 4 Well what do we have here? We have heard rumors that the Note 4 could sport a curved display that wraps around the edges. However, we kind of new that production would probably be an issue, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a shocker if Samsung released two devices. Well the proof is in the pudding, and the picture above shows us that Samsung will unveil two phones today. You can clearly see the Note Edge&#8217;s display wraps around the right side revealing notifications, but we aren&#8217;t sure about the left side.I would expect the Note Edge to be similar to the Galaxy Round in that it will be very, and I mean very, limited. Just a few more hours until we find out everything for sure.source: Android Police
