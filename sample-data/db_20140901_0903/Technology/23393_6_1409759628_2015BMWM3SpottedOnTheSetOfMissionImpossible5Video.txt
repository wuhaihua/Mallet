2015 BMW M3 Spotted On The Set Of Mission Impossible 5: Video 2015 BMW M3 Spotted On The Set Of Mission Impossible 5: Video The BMW brand had a starring role in 2011's Mission Impossible 4 – Ghost Protocol, with two of its vehicles, a 6-Series Convertible and the i8-previewing Vision EfficientDynamics concept, featuring in the hit movie. Now it’s been revealed that at least one BMW vehicle will feature in the upcoming fifth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise due out next year.
The vehicle is the all-new 2015 BMW M3, which has been spotted during filming for Mission Impossible 5 on location in Morocco. Video uploaded to YouTube by user The Hidden Wiki (via Bimmerpost) shows a silver M3 driven hard in front of one of Morocco’s famous kasbahs.
The video shows the sport sedan tackling some stairs and then bouncing on a dirt path before racing on the street. Yes, the scene looks quite punishing on the M3 and the film crew have a handful of the cars on hand in case something breaks.
Not much is known about the new movie. The current release date is December 25, 2015, and actors from the previous movies such as Tom Cruise, Paula Patton, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are all set to return._______________________________________Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google +.
