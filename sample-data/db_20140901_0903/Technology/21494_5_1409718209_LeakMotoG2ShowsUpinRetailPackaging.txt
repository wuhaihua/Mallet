Leak: Moto G2 Shows Up in Retail Packaging Leak: Moto G2 Shows Up in Retail Packaging Is this the successor to the Motorola G? Sure looks like it. Actually, from the looks of the retail packaging, it seems that Motorola may not be calling the device the G2 after all. The retail packaging clearly states Moto G, suggesting that Motorola could be using the same name for an updated model of its budget smartphone. Motorola has already made the a 4G LTE Moto G is a reality, so this photo could be of that guy too. Whatever Motorola has in store for us we&#8217;ll know pretty quickly; Motorola is set to hold a press conference this coming Thursday where the Moto X+1 is expected to be revealed.
What do you think? Is this the Moto G2 or Moto G 4G LTE?
