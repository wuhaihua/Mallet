Sammy Glam: Samsung announces Gear S Strap with embedded Swarovski crystals Sammy Glam: Samsung announces Gear S Strap with embedded Swarovski crystals If I had a lot of money &#8211; and I don&#8217;t &#8211; but if I did, I would probably still not get this, but each to their own. Samsung just announced the Gear S Strap with embedded Swarovski crystals, a swanky take on Samsung&#8217;s latest smartwatch, the newest addition to Samsung&#8217;s &#8220;Swarovski with Samsung&#8221; range which includes the likes of a Samsung Galaxy S5 with crystals embedded in the back cover. The Gear S Strap also employs the use of something called &#8220;Crystal Fine Mesh&#8221; which is apparently the latest thing from Swarovski.
The newly announced Gear S was already a pretty stylish thing, so unless you&#8217;re swimming in cash, this might not be the smartwatch for you, though Samsung is interestingly mum on pricing in its press release. Apart from the crystals, there don&#8217;t appear to be any differences in the device so you will still get a dualcore 1GHz processor, a curved 2-inch AMOLED display, a 300mAh battery and a 3G modem that will enable mobile data features on the device.
