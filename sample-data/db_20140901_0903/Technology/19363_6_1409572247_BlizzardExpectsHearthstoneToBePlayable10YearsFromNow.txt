Blizzard Expects Hearthstone To Be Playable 10 Years From Now Blizzard Expects Hearthstone To Be Playable 10 Years From Now When the World of Warcraft TCG came to an end, we’re sure many wondered if Blizzard would ever come up with another TCG and sure enough they did in the form of Hearthstone. Hearthstone, for those unfamiliar, is Blizzard’s latest game and it is a free-to-play title, although gamers have the option of paying for new packs of cards if they’d rather not grind for it.
That being said, the game has taken off in a huge way and there are many prominent Hearthstone players at the moment, but given that the game started off pretty small, how big are Blizzard’s ambitions for the game? Speaking in an interview with the folks over at IGN, Hearthstone’s producer Yong Yoo revealed that they plan for players to keep playing the game, even 10 years from now.
Speaking about how Blizzard prices Hearthstone’s in-app purchases, Yong was quoted as saying, “We’re not here to make a quick buck. I want to be playing and working on Hearthstone 10 years from now and from that end, instead of focusing on maximising immediate profit, Hearthstone is really about being able to play it how you want to.&#8221;
Given that World of Warcraft seems to be winding down in terms of active subscribers and how Blizzard does not seem overly optimistic that World of Warcraft will ever see the same numbers again, could Hearthstove end up being Blizzard’s next cash cow? We guess we’ll have to wait and find out, but in the meantime do you see yourself playing the game maybe 5 or 10 years from today?
