Google Forms Now Lets You Create Customized Themes Google Forms Now Lets You Create Customized Themes Google Forms is one of the most popular methods of creating surveys and forms, but until now it’s been limited in terms of visual customization. Today, Google introduced custom themes for forms, allowing you to add more of a personal touch to your documents.

To add a custom theme, click on the ‘Change theme’ button in the toolbar. You can then add your own header photos, change the background, choose fonts and colors and more. Alternatively, you can select from one of many new premade themes.
It’s a small but appreciated change that should make Google Forms a bit more useful, and maybe even get some extra RSVPs to your next party.
