Bloomberg: Apple's Teamed With Visa And MasterCard On An IPhone Wallet Bloomberg: Apple's Teamed With Visa And MasterCard On An IPhone Wallet 
Over the weekend, it was rumoured that Apple was working with American Express to turn your iPhone into a smart wallet. Now, a new report suggests that Apple is also teaming up with Visa and MasterCard, too.

Bloomberg reports that a person familiar with the situation has told it that Apple is in the process of setting up a &#8220;partnership with major payment networks, banks and retailers.&#8221; The rumour reaffirms Recode&#8217;s suggestion that Apple is working with American Express, adding MasterCard and Visa to the list.
The report suggests that the new iPhone will include a near-field communication chip &#8212; an addition which has been rumoured for a very, very long time. Alongside TouchID, Bloomberg explains, that technology will &#8220;allow consumers to securely pay for items in a store with the touch of a finger&#8221; by lining their device to their credit card. The news wire claims that the new smart wallet system will be announced on September 9th at Apple&#8217;s iPhone event.
With reports now by Recode, The Information and now Bloomberg all focussing on a real, working Apple smart wallet, there&#8217;s some weight behind these rumours. But given that NFC has continually been expected on the iPhone while never actually appearing, it&#8217;s still worth taking a good o&#8217;l pinch of salt with the rumour. Let&#8217;s wait until the 9th to find out. [Bloomberg]
