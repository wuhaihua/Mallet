HTC Y5 Is A Mid-Range Phablet (Rumor) HTC Y5 Is A Mid-Range Phablet (Rumor) HTC and tablets do not really make for a good marriage as what had transpired in the past did not prove inspirational for the Taiwanese company, although they look set to strain ahead and move forward with the rumored Nexus 9 from Google, where HTC is touted to be the hardware manufacturer for this device. Well, how about phablets? HTC has had better luck in this particular department, and in the latest rumor that hails from the serial leakster over at @upleaks, it would be the HTC Y5 that would come under scrutiny this time around.
The HTC Y5 is said to be a mid-range phablet that will be powered by the YellowStone mobile operating system, and it is headed towards the CMCC. As for its hardware specifications, it does look as though the HTC Y5 will be close to the HTC Desire 816. 
Just to refresh our memories on what the HTC Desire 816 offers and to get a better idea on what the HTC Y5 might bring with it in the end, we are most probably looking at a 5.5&#8243; display at 720p resolution, 8GB of internal memory, a microSD memory card slot, a Snapdragon 400 chipset, a 13MP shooter at the back with a 5MP shooter in front, and perhaps even a BoomSound loudspeaker. Are you stoked yet?
