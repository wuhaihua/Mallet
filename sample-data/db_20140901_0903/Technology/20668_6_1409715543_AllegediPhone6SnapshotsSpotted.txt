Alleged iPhone 6 Snapshots Spotted Alleged iPhone 6 Snapshots Spotted Much has been said about the upcoming iPhone 6 from Apple, especially when you take into consideration that it ought to be introduced to the masses some time later this month. Well, someone has already sent out some photos of the upcoming iPhone 6, where it shows off the hotly anticipated iPhone 6 (or at least, this is what we have been led to think after checking out the image on the right) that has been turned on, showing off the iOS lockscreen along the way.
It remains to be seen whether this would be the white or gold version of the iPhone 6 (after all, the white balance does play trick on the eyes sometimes). Other than that, there is also a space gray variant for the upcoming iPhone 6.
Other hardware specifications do point to a 4.7&#8243; IPS LCD display at 960 x 1704 pixel resolution, 2GB RAM, a dual-core 2GHz 64-bit processor with the Apple A8 chipset, as well as a very real possibility 128GB of internal storage making its debut with this particular iPhone generation. There ought to be a couple of screen sizes as well, with a 5.5‚Äù model on its way that will feature an extra durable sapphire display. So, do you think that this is the real deal, or a hoax?
