					We&#8217;ve all seen photos of the new spaceship-like headquarters Apple is building in Cupertino, California right now, but none of us have seen it quite like this. YouTube user &#8220;jmcminn&#8221; last week posted a video he shot using a DJI Phantom 2 &#8220;drone&#8221; equipped with a GoPro Hero 3+ video camera. The video gives us the first bird&#8217;s-eye view of Apple&#8217;s Campus 2, which is currently under construction in Cupertino.The video is incredibly clear and it shows us exactly how unique and interesting (in other words, bizarre) Apple&#8217;s futuristic new spaceship campus is shaping up to be.The full drone video is embedded below.
