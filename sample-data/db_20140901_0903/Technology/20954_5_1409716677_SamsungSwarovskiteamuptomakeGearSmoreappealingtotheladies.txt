Samsung, Swarovski team-up to make Gear S more appealing to the ladies Samsung, Swarovski team-up to make Gear S more appealing to the ladies Samsung is yet again partnering with Swarovski to add more bling to its products. This time round, it&#8217;s the newly announced Gear S which is getting the crystal treatment; more precisely, the wearable will be using Swarovski&#8217;s latest Crystal Fine Mesh product that is apparently used by &#8220;top brands in the fashion industry.&#8221;
The end result looks sexy, making for a perfect gift for the coming Christmas season. Or not; Samsung failed to mention the price in its press release, only saying that this special Gear S will start selling in October.
New smart watch aside, Swarovski will also be helping Samsung make the about-to-be-launched Galaxy Note 4 nicer for the ladies. They haven&#8217;t specifically said the Note 4 will get some crystal love; they said that Samsung&#8217;s &#8220;next flagship device&#8221; will get crystal-adorned back covers.
As a reminder, earlier Swarovski-Samsung products include accessories for the Galaxy S5, Gear Fit and Galaxy Note 3.
So, any takers?
