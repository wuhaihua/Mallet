					Google has traditionally dropped the ball when it comes to timely releasing Nexus device accessories, but this might change once the HTC Nexus 9 is launched. Echoing reports that suggested the upcoming high-end Nexus tablet might get a variety of case accessories, including a keyboard folio, Android Police has discovered more details about the device&#8217;s brand-new keyboard accessory.FROM EARLIER: Leak reveals HTC Nexus 9 launch details and accessoriesAccording to the information and images published by the website, it appears the HTC Nexus 9 will have an accessory that combines the best of two accessories available for competing devices, including the iPad’s Smart Cover and the Surface Pro’s Type Cover keyboard.Just like the Smart Cover, the Nexus 9 will have a segmented screen cover that can be turned into a stand (with help of embedded magnets) that can also wake up device and lock it back, depending of its position on top of it.The second half of the keyboard folio includes the actual keyboard, which happens to be extremely thin just like the Surface&#8217;s keyboard accessory and packs 3mm slim keys that have a pitch of around 15mm. The keyboard is “marginally more cramped than a standard keyboard,” offering users access to the regular QWERTY keys but also Android function keys.The keyboard folio measures 320 x 228 x 5mm and packs a 450mAh battery that will likely power the keyboard. The charging port for the accessory should be located in the hinge, as seen in images above.Launch and price details for this particular Google Nexus 9 accessory are yet to be revealed.Concept images showing what the HTC Nexus 9 and its keyboard folio might look like follow below.
