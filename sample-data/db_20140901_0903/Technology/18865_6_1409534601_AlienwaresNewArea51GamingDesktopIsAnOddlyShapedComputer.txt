Alienware’s New Area-51 Gaming Desktop Is An Oddly-Shaped Computer Alienware’s New Area-51 Gaming Desktop Is An Oddly-Shaped Computer Alienware has been known in the past to create some pretty funky-looking computers with glowing lights and whatnot, although safe to say that the company’s latest computer is out of this world. Alienware has recently taken the wraps off their latest gaming computer, which is basically a refresh of their Area-51 flagship computer.
As you can see in the image above, it definitely does not look like a computer, at least not upon first glance. We guess you will either love it or hate it depending on your preference and your taste in aesthetics. That being said while its exterior might not sit well with some, we guess it’s the innards that truly matter.
The new Area-51 desktop will feature a new Intel Haswell-E Extreme Edition CPU which would be great for users looking for the best performance in their computers. Alienware is expected to offer multiple configurations, including the Core i7-5960X which is Intel’s first octa-core desktop processor. The Area-51 is also expected to be able to house three full-length GPUs, five SSDs and/or hard drives, all of which will be powered by a 1,500-watt PSU.
The computer will also come with built-in WiFi and software that will allow users to configure the lights on the computer. Pricing and availability have yet to be confirmed, although Alienware promises that it will be “coming soon”. Either way what do you guys think? Are you digging the new look?
