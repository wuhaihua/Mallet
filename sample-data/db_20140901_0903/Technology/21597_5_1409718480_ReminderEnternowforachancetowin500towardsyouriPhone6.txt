Leave an awesome comment on our contest post for your chance to win $500 towards your iPhone 6!


Apple is expected to be announcing the next generation iPhone — call it iPhone 6 — on Tuesday, September 9, 2014 and iMore is going to be the absolute best place to get everything you need to know!. Seriously, have you seen our incredibly in-depth iOS 8: Explained series? Yeah, STILL only the beginning! We don't want you to miss anything, so to help encourage you to follow us, be it on App Store, RSS, Twitter, App.net, Facebook, Google+iMore, YouTube, or iTunes, we're going to hold a massive, mega countdown to iPhone 6 contest and give each and every one of you a chance to win a $500 Gift Certificate to put towards Apple's iPhone 6!



All you have to do to enter is leave a comment on the contest post (not here!) letting us know what you're looking forward to most in the new iPhone 6.

That's it! It couldn't be any easier! (And depending on your contract/subsidy status, you could end up getting that iPhone 6 absolutely free!)

Usual iMore contest rules apply, contest ends Tuesday September 8, 2014 at 11:59pm PDT. We'll announce the winners just before the iPhone event, so stay tuned!

Ready? Set? ENTER!
