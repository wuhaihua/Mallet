Both the FBI and Apple are investigating the theft of private celebrity photos in an intrusion that may have used iCloud to gain access to the images. As reported by The Telegraph, FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller confirmed the government agency&apos;s activation investigation into the theft.&quot;[The FBI is] aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.&quot;This statement follows an earlier statement from Apple that it &quot;takes user privacy very seriously and is actively investigating the report.&quot;The hacker who leaked the photos on 4chan&apos;s image boards claimed he used iCloud to download the images. Subsequent analysis of photo exif data and other information have not definitely identified iCloud as the source of the photos.
