The most-subscribed creator on YouTube, PewDiePie, shut off the comments section on his page because it is clogged with spam, making it a poor platform for audience interaction, the 24-year-old announced in a video Tuesday.
"To me, it doesn't mean anything, like I don't care about it," PewDiePie said in a video posted to his channel last week, referring to the spam, self-promotion and offensive comments he has seen. "I don't want to see it."

This isn't the first time the Swedish gamer, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, disabled his comments section. He did the same last year after YouTube unveiled its new comment system, which rolled in Google+ profiles, and rewarded relevant comments.
Although he eventually reinstated the comments, PewDiePie, who has 30 million subscribers, said that this time it is permanent. The video is even called, "Goodbye Forever Comments."
 
The man who rakes in $4 million annually said in the video, which has already hit nearly 7 million views, that he decided to remove the comments section after he vacationed in New Orleans, and temporarily took a break from checking his Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accounts.
The creator of humorous content about video games had hoped YouTube would do something to fix his issues with the comments section, he said. YouTube does offer several filters for creators to blacklist commenters and filter spam, but that hasn't seemed to satisfy PewDiePie.
"I'm just sick of it," he said. "I wouldn't say it as we lose something; I would say it as taking the next step in the right direction."
The YouTube star plans to use other avenues to communicate with fans, who he calls "bros," such as hashtags on Twitter or Reddit.
"I just want to connect with you bros," he said. "That's all I care about because you bros' support really means everything to me."
