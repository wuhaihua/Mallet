Electric-vehicle charging stations. They may not just for the landed gentry anymore. At least in the Golden State.California lawmakers have passed a bill that would enable residential and commercial tenants to install electric-vehicle charging stations, provided that they foot the bill, according to Charged EVs. If passed into a law, Assembly Bill 2565 would make it harder for landlords to enact lease provisions that would prevent tenants from buying and installing such stations. Governor Brown has until the end of September to sign the bill, and there's another EV-friendly bill crossing his desk as well, the  Charge Ahead California Initiative (State Bill 1275).Green vehicle advocates like ChargePoint chief technology officer Richard Lowenthal have been lobbying for California lawmakers to pass laws that will help speed up EV charging station deployment. Lowenthal, in an op-ed in Capitol Weekly, estimated that the ratio of EVs to charging ports grew to eight-to-one from seven-to-one during last year alone. That's good, but the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the state will require at least one million charging stations by the end of the decade, while state lawmakers continue to cling to its goal of having 1.5 million zero-emissions vehicles on California's roads by 2025.For those keeping track, California is home to about 1,900 publicly accessible charging stations with about 5,400 charging outlets, according to the US Department of Energy. More than one in five US charging stations are in California.
