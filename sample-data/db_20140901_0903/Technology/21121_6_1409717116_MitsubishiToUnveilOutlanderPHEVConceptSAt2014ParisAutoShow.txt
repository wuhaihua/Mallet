Mitsubishi To Unveil Outlander PHEV Concept-S At 2014 Paris Auto Show Mitsubishi To Unveil Outlander PHEV Concept-S At 2014 Paris Auto Show Mitsubishi has released a pair of teaser images of a new plug-in hybrid concept the automaker is planning for next month’s 2014 Paris Auto Show. The concept is called the Outlander PHEV Concept-S, and it likely hints at the styling we can expect for the next-generation Outlander and its smaller Outlander Sport sibling.
From what we can see, the lines of the Outlander PHEV Concept-S appear to be an evolution of the styling seen in previous Mitsubishi concepts such as the XR-PHEV and the GC-PHEV.
The concept is based on the existing Outlander PHEV unveiled at the 2012 Paris Auto Show but has benefited from a refined interior and exterior design that Mitsubishi says “magnifies the Outlander PHEV's unique driving experience.”
Being based on the Outlander PHEV, expect the concept to feature the production SUV’s plug-in hybrid drivetrain, which consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with two electric motors. Mitsubishi says the concept's advanced drivetrain ensures it offers “soothing silent running” and “superior on-road performance.”
Stay tuned for the reveal in the lead up to the Paris Auto Show, which this year gets underway on October 2. For more on the show, head to our dedicated hub._______________________________________Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
