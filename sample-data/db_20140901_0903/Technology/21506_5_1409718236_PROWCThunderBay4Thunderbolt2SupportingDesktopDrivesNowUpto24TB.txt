(PR) OWC ThunderBay 4 Thunderbolt 2-Supporting Desktop Drives Now Up to 24 TB (PR) OWC ThunderBay 4 Thunderbolt 2-Supporting Desktop Drives Now Up to 24 TB OWC announced today that the ThunderBay 4 and ThunderBay 4 RAID 5 Edition are now available with up to 24 TB of capacity. The larger capacity option, combined with its ultra-quiet cooling technology, makes the ThunderBay 4 perfect for today's workstations where having a quiet desktop drive with ample storage is paramount to a productive workflow. 

The Speed, Freedom, and Capacity to do More
Equipped with dual Thunderbolt 2 ports, the ThunderBay 4 delivers blazing-fast speeds with sustained data rates up to 1,342 MB/s RAID 0 and up to 675 MB/s RAID 5. With capacities ranging from 4 TB to 24 TB, customers can get the optimal balance of storage, performance, and data-redundancy to fit their specific workflow requirements.   
For those wanting more freedom and flexibility, OWC offers the perfect "bring your own drives" solution with the ThunderBay 4 Enclosure Kit, and the ThunderBay 4 RAID 5 Edition Enclosure Kit. Add up to four hard drives, SSDs, or a mixture of both hard drives and SSDs for customizable performance to meet specific storage and backup needs. Set up a RAID 0, 1, 4, 5, or 1+0 array using SoftRAID and enjoy advanced features, such as drive monitoring, e-mail notification, and rapid rebuild capabilities. 

"I'm very impressed by ThunderBay 4's overall design and performance. I like that OWC chose to leave the RAID options strictly in the user's hands. This allows the ThunderBay 4 enclosure to be used in many different scenarios: as a backup, as extra storage, or with various RAID configurations to increase performance." - Tom Nelson, About.com 

Extremely Quiet, Cool, Durable, & Reliable
The ThunderBay 4's ultra-quiet cooling technology coupled with rugged, vibration-absorbing, non-skid feet minimizes sonic resonance and vibration to enable quiet performance. Combining this with the ThunderBay 4's durable, aluminum, open "flow-thru" vented enclosure design keeps the four internal drives cool and protects the enclosure's internal components. 

"As computers have become quieter and the need to reduce workspace noise becomes a focus, we know that our solutions need to be quieter too," said Larry O'Connor, Founder and CEO, OWC. "That's why all our high-performance ThunderBay 4 solutions come equipped with exceptional noise-reduction technology which resulted in reducing noise levels by approximately 33%. Fostering a productive workflow has never been easier with our ThunderBay 4, especially with the larger 24 TB capacity option."
