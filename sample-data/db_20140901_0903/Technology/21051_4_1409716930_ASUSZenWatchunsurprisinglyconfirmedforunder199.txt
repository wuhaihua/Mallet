ASUS ZenWatch unsurprisingly confirmed for under $199 ASUS ZenWatch unsurprisingly confirmed for under $199 ASUS CEO Jerry Shen confirmed to FocusTaiwan that they would be looking to target a price tag beneath $199 with their Android Wear based ASUS ZenWatch. Currently, at least through the Play Store, the lowest priced Android Wear device is the Samsung Gear Live that retails at $199. We have seen the LG G Watch appear through other retailers for $179 as well though.






The ASUS Zen branding is already known for packing a fair amount of hardware and tech into a device with a small price tag. I fully expected the ASUS ZenWatch to follow a similar model when it finally came to light. ASUS has pushed out a number of small teaser videos for the upcoming gadget, but all specs on the ZenWatch have been tight lipped. I am not sure that it would matter all that much if they did leak out early though. ASUS will be making the ZenWatch official tomorrow during IFA where we will finally get some details on the actual specs of the new device. I wonder if it will bring GPS hardware for the upcoming Android Wear update?
