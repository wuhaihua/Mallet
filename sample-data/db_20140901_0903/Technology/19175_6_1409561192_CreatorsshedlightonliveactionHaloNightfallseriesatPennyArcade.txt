								&#8220;Halo: Nightfall&#8221; is returning to familiar territory.
&nbsp;
The overseers of the popular franchise at 343 Industries announced Saturday at the PAX Prime gaming convention that the upcoming live-action &#8220;Halo&#8221; series would take place on a surviving fragment of the Alpha Ring, the intergalactic locale from the original &#8220;Halo: Combat Evolved&#8221; sci-fi shooter.
&nbsp;
&#8220;Our director, Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, felt really strongly that he wanted the setting to be a character,&#8221; executive producer Kiki Wolfkill told hundreds of fans gathered inside Seattle&#8217;s Benaroya Hall.
&nbsp;
Following the destruction of the Alpha Ring at the end of &#8220;Halo&#8221; by series protagonist Master Chief, the fragment now orbits an unidentified sun, making the surface inhospitable for several hours a day. &#8220;We really dug into how this fragment ended up there,&#8221; Wolfkill said.
&nbsp;
The live-action series takes place between the video games &#8220;Halo 4&#8243; and &#8220;Halo 5: Guardians,&#8221; which is set for release next year exclusively on the Xbox One console from Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Nightfall&#8221; centers on agent Jameson Locke, who is portrayed by Mike Colter and will be a playable character in &#8220;Halo 5.&#8221;
&nbsp;
The multi-part film will be released this year ahead of a live-action &#8220;Halo&#8221; TV series that will be produced by Steven Spielberg. The untitled show is scheduled to debut next year on Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live service, as well as the Showtime network.
&nbsp;
During this weekend&#8217;s PAX Prime panel, the developers also teased more details about &#8220;Halo: The Master Chief Collection,&#8221; which will bring four previous &#8220;Halo&#8221; installments to the next-generation Xbox One console alongside &#8220;Nightfall&#8221; on November 11.
&nbsp;
&#8220;Halo&#8221; audio director Paul Lipson played new tracks from Misha Mansoor and Steve Vai that will be part of a remastered edition of &#8220;Halo 2.&#8221; &#8220;It just wouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;Halo 2&#8242; without a guitar legend,&#8221; Lipson said.
