See what Samsung has to show us all while we liveblog from Berlin and New York


Tomorrow is going to be a pretty big deal for Android fans. Samsung is holding another Unpacked event — one so big it needs three venues to handle it all: Berlin, New York and Beijing. We expect to see the all new Galaxy Note 4, as well as a new, and more "independent" wearable in the Gear S and its SIM card slot. We also imagine there will be a surprise or two, because Samsung. You don't get to be the biggest smartphone maker in the world without having plenty of great products that people want.

We're going to be in both Berlin and New York, bringing everything Samsung has to say and show to you live and in realtime. Alex and Derek will be at the aptly named Tempodrome in beautiful downtown Berlin, while Phil and Andrew will be sitting pretty in New York's West Village.

Everyone will have laptops and cameras ready to go, and this is something you'll not want to miss! You'll find it right at the top of all the action here on the AC homepage. Join us!
