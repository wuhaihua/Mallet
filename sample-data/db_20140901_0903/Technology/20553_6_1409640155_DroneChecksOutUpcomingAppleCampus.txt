Drone Checks Out Upcoming Apple Campus Drone Checks Out Upcoming Apple Campus 
Early last month, we brought you word on new Apple Campus 2 photos that depicted some concrete foundation work that went on, and this time around, there is something far more interesting that you might want to take note of &#8211; a drone which has been outfitted with a camera managed to take to the skies to capture a drone’s eye view of the upcoming Apple Campus. 
Of course, there is a sense of excitement about it, as I am quite sure that many of us would be able to remember how when Apple first introduced plans for their upcoming new campus, most folks did say something about it being a “mothership” of sorts, or something in that vein. This particular project has been going on for quite some time already, and progress has been made &#8211; although it is still one year behind the original schedule, not to mention seeing its costs balloon by more than a couple of billion. Still, that is chump change to Apple considering the value of the company today.
Twitter user @jmcminn hooked up a GoPro camera to his DJI Phantom 2 drone before navigating it over the new Apple Campus’ construction site, and there is just an overwhelming sense of awe when one takes into consideration the overall size of Apple&#8217;s upcoming campus. Hopefully it will be on track to meet the 2016 opening date.
