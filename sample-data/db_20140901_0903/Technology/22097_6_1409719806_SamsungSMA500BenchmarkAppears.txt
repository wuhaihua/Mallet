Samsung SM-A500 Benchmark Appears Samsung SM-A500 Benchmark Appears It looks like there is more than meets the eye to the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, where this particularly stunning looking smartphone might just be the template, so to speak, of a new A-series that will include the following models: SM-A300, SM-A500, and SM-A700. In fact, the middle of the trio, the Samsung SM-A500, was also caught in a GFXBench benchmark database, which in turn enabled curious eyeballs to see what the possible or potential hardware specifications will arrive with the Samsung SM-A500.
Apparently, the Samsung SM-A500 will arrive with a 720 x 1280 pixels resolution display with 4.8” of viewing goodness, doing away with a 4.7” panel. Underneath the hood of the SM-A500 would be a quad-core 64-bit-capable Snapdragon 410 processor that gets the job done, never mind that it is not the most powerful Qualcomm chipset out there. Apart from that, a 12MP camera at the back will have a possible 4.7MP camera in front, with 2GB RAM and 8GB of internal memory to boot. Expect Android 4.4.4 KitKat to arrive right out of the box, although we do look forward to seeing Android L make an appearance in due time, too. Could this be the larger Galaxy Alpha variant after all?
