Bungie teams up with Google Maps to bring Destiny Planet View to the Masses Bungie teams up with Google Maps to bring Destiny Planet View to the Masses The upcoming release of Destiny from Bungie is a very highly anticipated game release. The sci-fi first person shooter is scheduled for release in just 7 days from today on September 9th. I know Â a number of people who already have time off from work planned just for the official launch of the title. Like any big name game title, keeping the public interested and keeping it in the headlines will inevitably help it sell well. A recently launched collaboration between Google and the games developing studio, Bungie, might be one of the better pushes we have seen to date.

&#8220;Created using Google Technologies, Destiny Planet View gives fans an immersive first look at Destiny&#8217;s in-game locations on Mars, Venus and the Moon. While the experience only reveals a small slice of Destiny&#8217;s massive worlds, users will be able step through each area and discover useful lore, gameplay tips and even a few hidden real-world and in-game incentives along the way.&#8221;






The Destiny Planet View leverages Google Maps and the talent of Bungie to bring gamers an explore-able version of three of the open world planets in the game. (The Earth&#8217;s Moon, Mars and Venus.) The website pulls you off our little rock and into space. You get little spoken intro and then are given access to all three locations. As you click around and explore you are given more details about each area. Each area gives you some images to look at, videos to watch and the ability to scout the areas a little before you finally jump into the game next week. It really is a pretty sweet promotional bit for the game.
