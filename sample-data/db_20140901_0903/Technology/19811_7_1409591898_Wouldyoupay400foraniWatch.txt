Would you pay $400 for an iWatch? Would you pay $400 for an iWatch? 
					Given how not-so-well most smartwatches have sold so far, Apple would have to be crazy to charge $400 for the iWatch unless it brought something truly new to the table&#8230; right? Re/code&#8217;s sources say that Apple execs &#8220;have discussed charging around $400 for the company’s new wearable device&#8221; although that&#8217;s apparently just one of many price points under consideration for different device types.In fact, pricing for the iWatch is apparently still very much up in the air and Re/code&#8217;s sources still aren&#8217;t sure whether Apple will even unveil any pricing at all during its September 9th event when it will show off its first wearable computer alongside the iPhone 6.Unlike the iPhone 6, which has practically been leaked to death at this point, the iWatch is still shrouded in almost total mystery. We still haven&#8217;t seen any leaked images of the device yet and it likely won&#8217;t go into mass production until later this year. In fact, we still don&#8217;t know whether what Apple plans to show off on September 9th will be an actual smartwatch like the Moto 360 or a Nike FuelBand-style fitness band.We&#8217;ll learn in just a little over a week, but until then be sure to take our poll that asks, &#8220;Would you spend $400 on the iWatch?&#8221;
