Droid Landing Twitter account alerts to “Reactivation fast approaching” Droid Landing Twitter account alerts to “Reactivation fast approaching” The Droid Landing twitter account has been the feed for all things Motorola Droid over the years. They have made announcements, run contest and pushed out all sort of information. The twitter account has been silent for quite some time, December of last year to be exact, when they retweeted about a KitKat update for the Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx. Now the account has come alive again with a simple little tweet that helps solidify a new addition to the family.
Reactivation fast approaching, wait and see

It certainly doesn&#8217;t offer much of anything about anything for us. At least we will find out what the deal is come Thursday during the event that is planned.
Random thoughts about it all:
It does pull back some thoughts on a previous benchmark filing that circled around the web that some thought was going to be the Moto X+1. I didn&#8217;t buy it at the time because the benchmarks carried a device model number of XT912a. The XT912 is the Droid Razr for Verizon. They carried benchmarks that showed a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor at about 2.3GHz, 2GB of RAM, 32GB on-board storage, a 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 screen resolution and Android 4.4.3.
Does that mean that this is what we can expect? Possibly, but I suspect some tweaks were probably made after the fact.
