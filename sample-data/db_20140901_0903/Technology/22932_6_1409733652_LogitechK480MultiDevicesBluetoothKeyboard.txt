Logitech K480 Multi-Devices Bluetooth Keyboard Logitech K480 Multi-Devices Bluetooth Keyboard Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if you had a keyboard that you could use for multiple devices at once? We know it can be a bit frustrating that you’re typing away at your computer, then you have to rely on your smartphone or tablet’s virtual keyboard if you wished to reply to messages or emails from there.
Well, the good news is that Logitech has recently announced the Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480, which as the name already implies, can be used with multiple devices at once. One of the key features is its ability to swap between devices at a flick of the Easy-Switch dial. That way you can easily toggle between your computer, smartphone, or tablet.

		
			
				
			
			
				
			
			
				
			
			
				
			
			
				
			
			
				
			

The Logitech K480 will be a full-sized desk keyboard so users won’t have to worry about compromising on size, unlike keyboards designed for smartphones and tablets which seem to be a bit small in nature, presumably to help make it a bit more portable, but if you’d rather have functionality and comfort then perhaps the K480 could be for you.
Logitech has priced the K480 Bluetooth keyboard at $49.99 which is pretty reasonable, especially since keyboard cases designed for tablets tend to cost more (around double that price), and is expected to be made available in both US and Europe markets this September. It will also play nicely with a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, iOS, and Android.
