Microsoft Just Accidentally Teased Windows 9 Microsoft Just Accidentally Teased Windows 9 
We know that Windows 9 is on its way, but it could appear sooner than we expected. Microsoft China just mistakenly teased the new OS, announcing that it&#8217;s &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;

Taking to Weibo, Microsoft China asked: &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s latest OS Windows 9 is coming soon, do you think the start menu at the left bottom will make a come back?&#8221; There was a logo, too &#8212; though the post was quickly removed. A silly slip, but one that does suggest that we can expect Windows before too long. Indeed, there are plenty of whisperings that suggest the OS could be announced on or around September 30th, with preview versions available to developers immediately. Let&#8217;s wait see.
