								Chinese smartphone maker Lenovo has launched budget A536 smartphone in India for a price of Rs 8,999. The Lenovo A536 will be available via the company&#8217;s online Do Store and from physical retail stores.
&nbsp;
Running Android KitKat, the Lenovo A536 is a dual-SIM phone which also features Lenovo&#8217;s custom UI with no app drawer and customised apps for messaging, phone dialler etc. It sports a 5-inch FWVGA (480&#215;854 pixels) IPS display, which may suffer due to the lack of high resolution. The A536 is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek (MT6582) processor coupled with 1GB of RAM. It comes with 8GB internal storage which is further expandable via microSD card (up to 32GB). The price range puts in direct competition against the likes of Moto E and Xiaomi Redmi 1S.

There&#8217;s a 5-megapixel rear autofocus camera with LED flash, while the A536 also has a 2-megapixel front camera. The 2000mAh Li-ion battery though sounds terrific given the hardware; it is rated for up to 15 hours of usage and up to 300 hours of standby time.
