								In a breakthrough to develop long-lasting batteries for smartphones and other gadgets, scientists have successfully created a sugar bio-battery that completely converts the chemical energy in sugar substrates into electricity.
&nbsp;
This bio-battery can achieve an energy-storage density of about 596 ampere-hours (A/h) per kg &#8211; an order of magnitude higher than the 42 A-h/kg energy density of a typical lithium-ion battery used in various gadgets.
&nbsp;
&#8220;A sugar bio-battery with such a high-energy density could last at least 10 times longer than existing lithium-ion batteries of the same weight,&#8221; said YH Percival Zhang, an associate professor of biological systems engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, popularly known as Virginia Tech.
&nbsp;
The bio-battery is a type of enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) &#8211; an electro-biochemical device that converts chemical energy from fuels such as starch and glycogen into electricity.
&nbsp;
&#8220;We are first to demonstrate the complete oxidation of the bio-battery&#8217;s sugar so we achieve a near-theoretical energy conversion yield that no one else has reported,&#8221; Zhang added.
&nbsp;
The sugar bio-battery is also less costly than the lithium-ion battery and environmentally friendly, researchers reported in the journal Nature Communications.
