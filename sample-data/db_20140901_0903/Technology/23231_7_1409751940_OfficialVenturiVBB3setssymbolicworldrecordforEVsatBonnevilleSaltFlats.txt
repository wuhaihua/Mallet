Despite the cancellation of Bonneville Speed Week, there was good electric vehicle news to report from the salt flats last week. Symbolically, at least.Venturi was not able to break the FIA's electric vehicle world speed record for all weight categories with the sleek EV needle that is the Venturi VBB 3. Venturi says the problem was "an almost unprecedented double meteorological event" that were the violent storms and winds that struck the Salt Lake City area in August and flooded parts of the salt flats. Nonetheless, Venturi and Ohio State (the "BB" stands for Buckeye Bullet) did the best they could out in Bonneville over four days and got the VBB3 up to a top speed of 270 miles per hour. That was good enough to set a new record for at least one weight class, an EV over 3.5 metric tons, but not what the team was shooting for.Venturi and Ohio State had hoped to set a new record at 373-mph record last year, but rain once again forced a delay. The current record was set at 307.58 mph in 201 and is held by, wait for it, the Venturi VBB 2.5. So, despite the setbacks, Venturi is just competing against itself and will return to the flats in 2015. You can find the symbolically excited press release below.
