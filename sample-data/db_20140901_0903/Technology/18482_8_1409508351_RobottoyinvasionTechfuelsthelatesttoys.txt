Robot toy invasion: Tech fuels the latest toys Robot toy invasion: Tech fuels the latest toys Forget dollhouses, footballs and jigsaw puzzles — kids today want tech in their toys.Whether its video games, touch-screen tablets or radio-controlled flying drones, many of 2014's "most wanted" fuse entertainment with electronics.And in many cases, the lines are blurring between playing and programming — whether it's Lego Mindstorms with "on-brick programming," Sphero 2.0's Macrolab app (with code you can share among friends) or the Moss robot construction kit.The following is a look at a few of the buzzworthy robotic toys available this fall.Sphero 2.0Kids can quite literally have a ball with Sphero 2.0 ($129.99), an app-controlled waterproof toy that rolls around the floor, lights up in different colors and can be used to play more than 30 different games and activities downloadable from the App Store or Google Play market. Most of the supported apps are free.Using Bluetooth wireless technology to control the ball up to 100 feet away, apps range from zombie-smashing adventures and racing challenges to a golf simulation and "augmented reality" games that also use your mobile device's camera to overlay virtual info onto the real world around you.As a bonus, two ramps are included in the box, along with an "induction" charging station (just place the ball on the cup to power up).Kids who want to program their own Sphero game or activity can download free SPRK lessons or apps like MacroLab.Coming this fall, Sphero's creators will launch another rolling robot named Ollie ($99.99).MiPNominated for a "Last Gadget Standing" award at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), WowWee's MiP ($99.99) — which is short for "Mobile Inverted Pendulum" — is a 10-inch-tall robot you can control with a free app (iOS and Android) or  through hand gestures and voice commands. Or simply let it discover its surroundings in the autonomous mode.Rhyming with "pip," MiP can balance on its two wheels, dance, sing, perform tricks and bring you a drink on its snap-on tray (included).Game highlights include "Cage," where MiP is trapped in a virtual cage and it's up to you to prevent its escape by blocking all the exits, and "Stack," where you must pile as many objects as you can on MiP's tray before the timer runs out.Not sure where to start with MiP's abilities? A 15-part video tutorial is available at wowwee.com/mip.Lego Mindstorms EV3I'm pretty sure the Lego we played as kids didn't have programmable pieces.But this is the case with Lego Mindstorms EV3 ($349.99), an advanced robotics kit that lets kids build five different robots out of the box — such as a humanoid, vehicle and reptile. You can download a dozen more designs from the Internet or make your very own creations and share them with friends.In fact, Lego offers free downloadable programming software, .EV3, for use with Windows and Macs. Kids won't have to know code thanks to an intuitive and icon-based drag-and-drop interface.With free smartphone or tablet apps (Android and iOS), you can further program and control these versatile creatures to do what you want. Plus, they'll interact with the environment on their own as these robots have infrared sensors for autonomous play, such as the snake-like robot that lunges and hisses if it senses something in front of it (hint: it's a fun way to scare friends).At the heart of Mindstorms is the Intelligent EV3 Brick with powerful ARM9 processor, USB port for Wi-Fi and Internet connectivity, microSD card reader, back-lit buttons and four motor ports.ChatstersWhile not a robot, per se, toymaker Spin Master has just launched its first interactive doll for girls ages 5 and up."Gabby" is the first in the Chatsters ($79.99) toy lineup, and let's just say she wants to be your daughter's BFF.At 11 inches tall, Gabby talks, dances and plays games and activities through her touch-enabled eyeglasses frames. In fact, many parts of Gabby's body and wardrobe have sensors, and when combined with accessories (included), will cause Gabby to say or do something fun.For example, she might ask for a makeover, so if you touch the lipstick to her lips they'll change to one of seven colors. If Gabby asks you to text her, place her mini smartphone in her hand. You can have her puppy, Sprinkles, give her a kiss, and so on.In fact, you can "text" the doll through the free, downloadable app (iOS and Android) and she'll react accordingly. Or why not take a selfie with her?Chatsters also make silly comments, burps and passes gas, giggles and more.Follow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman. E-mail him at techcomments@usatoday.com.
