Microsoft Teases Upcoming Nokia Selfie Phone Microsoft Teases Upcoming Nokia Selfie Phone According to previous leaks and rumors, word on the street has it that Microsoft has a new Nokia Lumia handset in the works that could be aimed at users who enjoy taking selfies. Recently photos of the Lumia 730 and 735 have leaked and it looks like Microsoft is busy teasing the launch as well.
The Redmond company has recently posted a teaser image on Nokia’s website which clearly shows a trio of people in a photo taking selfies. In fact the website even has a countdown to the event which will be taking place on the 4th of September, so if you’re after a selfie-focused camera then perhaps Microsoft’s upcoming announcement could be for you.
That being said, not much is known about the handsets for now. They are rumored to feature a 5MP front-facing camera and the main difference in the Lumia 730 and Lumia 735 is the former will be a dual SIM version of the phone, while the latter is said to feature LTE connectivity. Both devices are also rumored to feature a 4.7-inch display.
Unfortunately apart from that not much else is known, although with the 4th of September creeping up on us, we guess we won’t have to wait too long to see what Microsoft has in store for us.
