Lenovo’s Vibe X2 Invite Takes A Slight Poke At Apple Lenovo’s Vibe X2 Invite Takes A Slight Poke At Apple Just last week, Apple sent out invites to an event for the 9th of September which is where they will presumably announce the iPhone 6. The tagline reads, “Wish we could say more,” and it looks like Lenovo has drawn some inspiration from Apple’s invite because in a recent post on Twitter, the company reminded users that they had something to announce on the 4th of September.
As you can see in the image above, the design of the invite certainly looks like it could have been inspired by Apple. That and the fact that the tagline reads, “We can’t say anything either,” seems to be a subtle jab at Apple’s own invite. That being said, the invite clearly shows that Lenovo will be announcing the Vibe X2 at their event.
We’ve recently seen a leaked photo of the handset which shows off what appears to be a metal body. The lollipop in the invite also seems to hint that the phone will be one of the few phones to come with Android L preinstalled, although previous reports have suggested that “L” could stand for Lemon Meringue Pie.
Other rumors about the Lenovo Vibe X2 includes a 5-inch Full HD display, 2GB of RAM, a 5MP front-facing camera, and a 13MP rear-facing camera, but we guess we won’t have to wait too long to find out if the rumors are true, so check back with us on the 4th of September for all the official details!
