Droidcon NYC hosts talks by Roman Nurik, Jean-Baptiste Queru Droidcon NYC hosts talks by Roman Nurik, Jean-Baptiste Queru 

If you're an Android lover and a developer who will be in the New York area between September 20th and September 21st, you should take a look at Droidcon NYC, which will host talks from Google Android Developer Advocate Roman Nurik and Jean-Baptiste Queru "JBQ", who is a senior mobile engineer at Yahoo. The two will talk about Android design, specifically the new Android L Material Design, so it should prove to be interesting.



Nurik and JBQ will be joined by Kevin Grant, an Android engineer at Google, and Chrise Haseman, who's Tumblr's director of mobile, at Droidcon.

If you're interested, take a look at the Droidcon NYC page at the source link below. Register before September 5th and you can save $200 on the conference; regular admissions cost $595 and students can register for just $100.

Is this a conference that you're interested in considering that there will be a number of devoted Android evangelists on hand?
