Apple broadens diversity efforts with new scholarships Apple broadens diversity efforts with new scholarships 

Citing that diversity would help Apple build better products, the Cupertino, California iPhone-maker announced that it will be awarding two $10,000 scholarships to minority students pursuing a technology education in universities. In addition to the financial award, the recipients would also be considered for Apple's internship program.



The Product Integrity Inclusion and Diversity Scholarship offered by Apple is open to women, black/African American, Hispanic, or Native American university students who would be at least a sophomore in a bachelor's program in the fall of 2015. The scholarships are also opened to master's and doctorate program candidates as well.

One scholarship, called sensor, asks applicants to propose a new sensor to go into an Apple product. A second test track scholarship asks applicants to design a trial vehicle to transport astronauts.

Are you a university student? Will you apply for Apple's diversity scholarship?
