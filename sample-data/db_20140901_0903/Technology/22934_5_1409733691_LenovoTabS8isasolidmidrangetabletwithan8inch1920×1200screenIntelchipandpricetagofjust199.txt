They&#8217;ve just announced the Lenovo Tab S8, a solid mid-range tablet with an 8-inch 1920&#215;1200 pixels IPS screen and Intel&#8217;s 1.86GHz Atom Z3745 Processor (with Intel Burst Performance Technology).
There&#8217;s also 2GB of RAM, 8-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus and f/2.2 aperture, 1.6MP front camera, Dolby-enhanced dual front speakers, 4,290 mAh battery, and 16GB of non-expandable storage (for some reason?). Android 4.4 KitKat is running the show.
Size wise, this thing measures 209.8 x 123.8 x 7.9 mm (8.1 x 4.8 x 0.31 inches) and has a weight of 299 grams (0.65 lbs).
The best part is the price &#8211; the Lenovo Tab S8 will go for as little as $199 (Wi-Fi only version), making it an easy sell. Hopefully, the Chinese giant will also launch few handy accessories for the Tab S8; otherwise, &#8220;serious users&#8221; will opt for some other product&#8230; Or at least that&#8217;s the way I see things.
