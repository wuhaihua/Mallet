Apple teams up with American Express, MasterCard and Visa over its mobile payments service? Apple teams up with American Express, MasterCard and Visa over its mobile payments service? It has been suggested that the next iPhone may finally integrate an NFC chip to enable contactless mobile payments, among other things. Alongside that rumor, we&#8217;ve also heard that Cook &amp; Co. are preparing to launch their own payments platform and have apparently cornered American Express, MasterCard and Visa over some kind of deal.
We&#8217;re not sure what these big boys are talking about, but chances are this Christmas season Apple&#8217;s revenues will skyrocket. Not only will it sell a ton of iPhone and iPads, but will also make money from transactions conducted by millions of iUsers across the world. Actually, we would assume that any m-payment scheme will start in North America and gradually expand to other corners of the planet.
Apple already has payment details for many of its iTunes users, and tie this information with the NFC chip is the next logical step forward. In effect, they could bring iTunes payments to the real world.
Mobile payments aside, the NFC-equipped iPhone could propel the emerging m-ticketing space, allowing iPhone 6 owners to pay for their metro, bus and tram rides with nothing but their beloved handset.
Yes, the Cupertino company may become a force worth reckoning with in the mobile payments market, all while allowing its users to keep checks and balances using the Passbook app. Sounds like a plan; can&#8217;t wait to see what comes next.
