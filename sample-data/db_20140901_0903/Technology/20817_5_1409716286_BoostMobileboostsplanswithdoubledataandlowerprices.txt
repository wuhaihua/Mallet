Boost Mobile boosts plans with double data and lower prices Boost Mobile boosts plans with double data and lower prices 

Sprint prepaid subsidiary Boost Mobile is running a promotion from September 3 to November 3 that will give customers discounted plans with double the usual data. As long as customers sign up during this period and keep their accounts active, then they can keep their promotional plan. Now, with a $5 discount, the starting $35 plan will give customers unlimited talk and text with unlimited data, though only the first 1 GB will be at high speed.



Moving to the $45 plan with discount will give users 5 GB of high speed data, though there won't be overages if you exceed, just throttling. Similarly, the $55 plan gives users 10 GB of high speed data.

Are you a current Boost customer? Will you be taking advantage of this promotion come September 3? Let us know.
