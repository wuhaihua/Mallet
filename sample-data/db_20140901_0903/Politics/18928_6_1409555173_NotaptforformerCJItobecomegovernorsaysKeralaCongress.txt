Not apt for former CJI to become governor, says Kerala Congress Not apt for former CJI to become governor, says Kerala Congress 
					Thiruvananthapuram: The Congress in Kerala on Sunday expressed doubt over the aptness of a former chief justice of India taking over as the governor of a state."It's the chief justice of the country that swears in the president of our country. After that a person in that post going to serve under the president does not augur well," state Congress president VM Sudheeran told reporters. "I feel this aspect should be open to debate by all, including constitutional experts. I do not think it's apt," he said. Sathasivam, 65, who hails from the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, was the 40th chief justice of India, holding office from July 2013 to April 2014.IANS
