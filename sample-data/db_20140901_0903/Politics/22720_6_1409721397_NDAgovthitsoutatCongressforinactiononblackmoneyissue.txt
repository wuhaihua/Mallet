NDA govt hits out at Congress for inaction on black money issue NDA govt hits out at Congress for inaction on black money issue 
					New Delhi: The ruling NDA today hit out at the previous UPA regime saying it had failed to set up an SIT on black money despite a Supreme Court direction for the same even as it asserted that it will bring out the truth in the matter after acting on it on priority."Supreme Court had in a way directed the Centre to form an apex court-monitored SIT. For three years, the (UPA) government sat on it. After Narendra Modi became prime minister, the first decision at the first Cabinet meeting was regarding the constitution of the Special Investigation Team," Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said."You (Congress) were sitting on it for three years. We took up the matter and said that we will bring out the truth," the minister added during an 'Aaj Tak' event.Pradhan was responding to an attack by Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam who said that the issue of black money was raised during the Lok Sabha poll campaign and both Modi and Rajnath Singh had promised to bring it back within 100 days."Modi and Rajnath had promised that within 100 days, they will bring back black money. They didn't promise formation of an SIT in 100 days."Your government took oath on 26 May and 31 May was the last date (set by) SC for you to form the SIT. So you did not do any favour. You were satisfying SC. SC did not give votes to you, the people did with an expectation that you will bring back black money," Nirupam said.When the issue came up of parties' performance in the recent byelections in the country, Pradhan said that the results of such exercises in some state does not reflect the mood of the people across India.It is the people who will decide the outcome of elections and BJP will win three states in the upcoming Assembly polls in the country. Haryana, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand are all facing state polls."The results of bypolls is not (indicative of) the mood of the nation. Whatever results came in the bypolls, it was definitely not satisfactory... The party is thinking about it," Pradhan said.Meanwhile, taking a dig at Congress, Pradhan said that the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections was a "nightmare" for the party.Asked about the upcoming Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir, Pradhan said that going by the situation in the state, BJP was emerging as a strong alternative for the people.Pradhan said that the government had taken all the steps essential for the welfare of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh, but blamed the Samajwadi Party government in the state for the poor condition of farmers.Responding to Nirupam's claims about Modi being a "control freak", Pradhan said that books have now come out which have been penned by close aides of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and point out as to who was the real control freak in the last government.Nirupam said there was a certain disenchantment regarding BJP among the people of the country, as underlined by the recent bypoll results, and that, in the coming state-level elections, that disenchantment might work against the saffron outfit.PTI
