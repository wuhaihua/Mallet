Chose Adityanath to head UP campaign after much thought: BJP Chose Adityanath to head UP campaign after much thought: BJP 
					New Delhi: Justifying its decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as the face of its campaign for the Uttar Pradesh bypolls, BJP today said the MP was chosen after much deliberation within the party."It was done after much deliberations," BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said when asked whether there was any special reason to choose Adityanath among the three party leaders entrusted with leading the BJP campaign for the upcoming bye-elections in Uttar Pradesh.Speaking during a panel discussion on a TV news channel, Trivedi said Adityanath was just an MP whereas statements like Muslims have first claim on resources had been made by the former Prime Minister.Adityanath had recently said riots happen wherever they are more than 10 percent in numbers while there is no place for non-Muslims where they are more than 35 percent. Trivedi said the MP had said this in special context or situation, one cannot take it in the national context. He also alleged that Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders had also made controversial comments.Targeting the SP government in Uttar Pradesh, Trivedi claimed that in the last 20 years there had been three occasions when the army had to be called in due to the seriousness of communal violence in the state -- November 1990, September 1994 and October 2013."Was it mere coincidence that SP government was in power during all the three occasions? The present party in power in UP should do introspection as to why after their coming to power, the communal subject has become so sensitive? Even their Chief Minister says Muzzaffarnagar incident was a small
incident of eve teasing," he said.Earlier, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam had alleged that after new government's formation at the Centre, communal violence had erupted in 600 places in UP and there was an attempt to polarize the country through communal violence.Congress leader Jitin Prasada questioned Narendra Modi's "silence" in the matter and asked why he cannot tell his partymen and leaders that they should refrain from saying anything which gives rise to communal tension.JD(U) too attacked the BJP government saying that the slogan of this new regime has changed from "minimum govt, maximum governance" before elections to "minimum BJP, maximum VHP" after coming to power.
