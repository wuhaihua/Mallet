BJP on 'Mission 60 plus' in Haryana Assembly polls: Rajnath Singh BJP on 'Mission 60 plus' in Haryana Assembly polls: Rajnath Singh 
					Chandigarh: Buoyed by its performance in the Lok Sabha polls, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday asked party workers in Haryana to make an all-out effort to realise 'Mission 60-plus' in the upcoming State Assembly elections.Singh exuded confidence that BJP will once again prove the political pundits and analysts wrong by forming the Government on its own in Haryana and hit out at the ruling Congress over its leaders' alleged involvement in land scams and corruption.The tenure of the 90-member Haryana House will end on 27 October and the Election Commission hopes to complete the Assembly polls in the state before the third week of October.Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) earlier this week decided to snap ties with BJP alleging repeated betrayal by the saffron party.With an aim to garner all 90 Assembly seats on its own, Singh asked BJP leaders from the State to revise the number of their "Mission 46 plus (majority needed to form govt in Haryana) to Mission 60 plus now."The Minister was addressing a public gathering in Hathin in Palwal district in Haryana on the culmination of the BJP's 'Vijay Sankalp Yatra.'He slammed the Congress, saying the party does not have any issue to raise and therefore, keeps crying hoarse over the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha."They do not have any issue to raise. But they always keep raising the issue of Leader of Opposition post. They must know for this, they need 10 per cent minimum seats," he said.Mocking the Congress, he said, "Jab kad hein naheen raha, lekin pad unko chahiyee (they have lost stature, but they are adamant on the post)."PTI
