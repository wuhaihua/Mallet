Congress conspiring to tarnish image of NDA govt: Prakash Javadekar Congress conspiring to tarnish image of NDA govt: Prakash Javadekar 
					New Delhi: Opposition Congress is "conspiring to tarnish" the image of the Narendra Modi government after being unable to find anything against its "transparent" functioning, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said today.Hitting back at the opposition party for its comments that the NDA regime's first 100 days in power was "high on rhetoric and low on performance", Javadekar said the "policy paralysis" under the previous UPA regime had ended and decisions are now being taken transparently."Congress is conspiring to tarnish the image of the NDA government. As they cannot point a finger at the Modi government, they are unsuccessfully trying to tarnish its image by attempting to present it in a bad light," Javadekar said.Congress today dubbed Modi as a "dream merchant" and said he had come to power by selling "false hopes".Reacting to these comments, Javadekar said that with the NDA in power, the government has started functioning and confidence is building up among the public."People are now seeing that the government is taking decisions and there is no policy paralysis."Steps have been taken to improve the lives of the common people by initiating public welfare measures. Big initiatives are being taken to improve infrastructure, irrigation, tourism, skilling and employment generation," Javadekar said.He brushed aside talk that the initiatives of the NDA government were just a "repackaging" of previous UPA schemes.The Union minister for information and broadcasting said that neither BJP nor Modi had promised to control inflation in 100 days, unlike Congress which had done so in 2009, but were making every effort to keep prices in check.He said that with supply-side management, the government is sure that the steps taken would succeed in bringing down prices within a year or 18 months.PTI
