Brit Hume: ISIS Risks Awakening ‘Sleeping Giant’ With Journalist Beheadings [VIDEO] Brit Hume: ISIS Risks Awakening ‘Sleeping Giant’ With Journalist Beheadings [VIDEO] Fox News analyst Brit Hume noted on Tuesday that, despite public opposition to a new fight in Iraq, ISIS risks awakening a &#8220;sleeping giant&#8221; if their brutal beheadings and other atrocities spur angry Americans to advocate war against the Islamic radicals.
Hume spoke with Fox&#8217;s Bret Baier about the Tuesday release of a second video showing the savage decapitation of American journalist Steven Sotloff by an ISIS fighter. &#8220;What about the political power of this image?&#8221; Baier asked. &#8220;What does that mean here in the U.S.?&#8221;
&#8220;Well the American military is, at the moment, kind of a sleeping giant, and so is the American public in terms of public opinion about conflict and war,&#8221; Hume replied. &#8220;ISIS may get some propaganda points out of these hideous atrocities among people who sympathize with them &#8212; who can&#8217;t be all that numerous in this world &#8212; but I think the risk ISIS takes by doing these things and publicizing them in this way is it might awaken the sleeping giant.&#8221;
&#8220;The United States military &#8212; it would take a while, it would be costly &#8212; could wipe out ISIS,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s not gonna happen unless the public becomes aroused. But these kinds of atrocities just might have that effect.&#8221;
