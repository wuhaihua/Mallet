WH Spokesman: Obama 'Cautious' on ISIS, Just Like The Auto Bailout WH Spokesman: Obama 'Cautious' on ISIS, Just Like The Auto Bailout 						
	White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that President Obama&#8217;s &#8220;cautious&#8221; response to ISIS is similar to his response to the 2009 Detroit auto bailout.
“That was a risky maneuver,” Earnest said at a press conference, referring to Obama&#8217;s auto bailout. &#8220;It would not have been possible without this president, who is sometimes described as cautious.&#8221;
Earnest made his statement at a press conference at which it was revealed by reporters that ISIS beheaded another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, two weeks after threatening to kill Sotloff in a video in which the group beheaded journalist James Foley.
The Obama administration has long been obsessed with its costly taxpayer-funded bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. Obama&#8217;s re-election campaign produced an action movie about the bailout and Joe Biden proclaimed at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, &#8220;Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!&#8221;
Obama currently operates without a stated strategy for dealing with ISIS &#8212; a group that the U.S. has been closely monitoring since 2012 and which Obama has been getting at least some daily briefings on for a year.
