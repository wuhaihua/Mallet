Won't let BJP, any other party divide Maharashtra, says Shiv Sena Won't let BJP, any other party divide Maharashtra, says Shiv Sena 
					Mumbai: Staunchly opposing the demand for a separate state for the Vidarbha region, the Shiv Sena today
said it will not allow division of Maharashtra, even if it is sought by its alliance partner BJP or any other party."(Former Maharashtra Chief Minister) Ashok Chavan had alleged that the BJP is trying to divide Maharashtra into two parts. We congratulate him (for saying that). Whether it is the BJP or any other party dreaming of dividing Maharashtra, we will not let it happen," the Sena said in an editorial, in its mouthpiece 'Saamna'.The Sena was referring to the comments made by Chavan on Monday, while launching the Congress' campaign for the upcoming Assembly elections in the state, when he had accused the BJP of having a "secret agenda" to "split Maharashtra" and create a "separate state of Vidarbha".The 'Saamna' editorial also claimed that the Congress-NCP may try every trick under the hat to win the upcoming Assembly elections, but they will only be "greeted with failure"."Let the Congress do anything it can to gain in the upcoming Assembly elections, but it will continue to remain a dead party. The people of Maharashtra have taken a stand to oust the Congress from the state," it said.PTI
