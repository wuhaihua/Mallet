Feds Punish Business For Engaging In ‘Citizenship-Discrimination’ Feds Punish Business For Engaging In ‘Citizenship-Discrimination’ &nbsp;&nbsp;						
	A Texas catering business will pay the United States $26,400 for engaging in &#8220;citizenship-discrimination,&#8221; as part of a settlement with the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
Culinaire International unlawfully discriminated against employees based on their citizenship status, the Justice Department claimed, because it required non-citizen employees to provide extra proof of their right to work in the United States.
Culinaire has agreed to pay the United States $20,460 in civil penalties, receive training in anti-discrimination rules of the Immigration and Nationality Act, revise its work eligibility verification process, and create a $40,000 back pay fund for &#8220;potential economic victims.&#8221;
&#8220;Employers cannot discriminate against workers by requiring them to produce more documents than necessary in the employment eligibility verification and reverification processes,&#8221; Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights division, Molly Moran, said in a statement.
A lawful permanent resident&#8217;s card expires, but their right to work is permanent, and in this case Culinaire was requiring employees to present a renewed permanent resident card to be verified as work-eligible. The Justice Department claimed this violated a provision in the INA that prohibits employers from requiring extra documentation from non-citizen employees.
The Justice Department and Culinaire International did not immediately respond to request for comment.
