Parents of Dead Navy SEAL Call For Obama To Resign Parents of Dead Navy SEAL Call For Obama To Resign &nbsp;&nbsp;						
	The parents of slain SEAL Team Six hero Aaron Carson Vaughn wrote an open letter calling for President Barack Obama to resign in the aftermath of ISIS&#8217; beheading of American journalist James Foley.
Billy and Karen Vaughn, whose son was killed in action on August 6, 2011, wrote for The World Tribune that Obama&#8217;s lack of leadership endangers the country.
&#8220;As commander-in-chief, your actions — or lack thereof — Mr. President, cost lives,&#8221; the Vaughns wrote. &#8220;As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe. Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it.&#8221;
&#8220;Please vacate the people’s house and allow a man or woman of courage and substance to seize the reigns of this out-of-control thug-fest and regain the balance we, America, have provided throughout our great history.&#8221;
Thanks to your “leadership” from whatever multi-million dollar vacation you happen to be on at any given moment, the world is in chaos. What’s been gained, you’ve lost. What’s been lost, you’ve decimated. You’ve demolished our ability to hold the trust of allies. You’ve made a mockery of the title “president.” And you’ve betrayed the nation for which my son and over 1.3 million others have sacrificed their very lives.&#8221;
The Vaughns also noted first lady Michelle Obama&#8217;s 2008 statement that &#8220;For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country.&#8221;
&#8220;I am sure my deceased son thanks you for that, Mrs. Obama,&#8221; the Vaughns wrote. &#8220;Oh, and you’re welcome.&#8221;
