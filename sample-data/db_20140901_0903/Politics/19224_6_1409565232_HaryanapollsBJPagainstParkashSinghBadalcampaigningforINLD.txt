Haryana polls: BJP against Parkash Singh Badal campaigning for INLD Haryana polls: BJP against Parkash Singh Badal campaigning for INLD 
					Chandigarh: The Haryana unit of BJP has asked its central leadership to keep Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal away from campaigning for the Indian National Lok Dal for the upcoming state assembly polls.Former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala-led INLD, which is the State's main Opposition party, has declared 86-year-old Badal as the star campaigner for the upcoming polls, which are due in October."We have told our central leadership to resolve the issue. We want that Badal should be stopped from campaigning for the INLD and he should not come (to Haryana to seek votes for INLD)," Haryana BJP's legislature party leader and Ambala MLA, Anil Vij told PTI over phone on Monday.He said that "we have put our point before our central leaders and now it is up to them to resolve the matter".He did not make further comments on why Badal should not campaign for the INLD, though he added that the SAD, which is a key ally of the BJP, has in the past also taken a plea that they have an alliance with the Chautala-led party in Haryana.The Haryana Janhit Congress last week snapped its three-year-old alliance with BJP accusing the saffron party of repeated betrayal.The BJP is now contesting the Haryana polls independently and is eyeing to win more than 60 of the total 90 seats on its own.The SAD and BJP run an alliance government in Punjab while the Akali Dal is also a key partner and ally of the NDA.Out of a total of 90 seats, INLD has left two seats for the SAD to contest in Haryana--Ambala City and Kalanwali.INLD's Hisar MP, Dushyant Chautala had yesterday in Jalandhar declared Badal as the star campaigner for the party for the assembly polls in Haryana.The Badal and the Chautala clans also share close family relations.Dushyant said Badal and other SAD leaders would campaign not only for SAD candidates, they would also campaign for INLD across Haryana.PTI
