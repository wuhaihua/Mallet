By-polls show AAP near oblivion in Punjab, says CM Badal By-polls show AAP near oblivion in Punjab, says CM Badal 
					Bathinda: Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today said that Aam Aadmi Party has lost its credibility after "betrayal" in Delhi and was nearing oblivion in Punjab."The AAP candidates have lost their securities in the Talwandi Sabo and Patiala by-elections which was an indicator enough to make AAP workers realise that the party was near oblivion in Punjab," he said.The chief minister said that in a democratic country every person has right to contest elections, but people repose faith in only those parties that have credibility and work for serving masses.He said the people of Delhi gave AAP an opportunity to form government but party president Arvind Kejriwal betrayed them by resigning from the post of Chief Minister."Intelligent voters will never believe a party that betrayed people," he was quoted as saying in a statement.He said for the past seven years the stable SAD-BJP alliance in the state is ushering in development and prosperity and due to its reliability, the people of Punjab have re-elected it.On being projected by Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana as its main campaigner for the upcoming polls, Badal said that he would canvass to dislodge anti-Sikh Congress from the state.
