					New Delhi: Scores of National Students' Union of India (NSUI) activists on Tuesday staged a protest outside the residence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi&nbsp;over the issue of black money stashed away in foreign banks.Protesters led by NSUI national president Roji M John raised slogans against BJP-led Central Government for "failing to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks"."Before Lok Sabha polls, various BJP leaders had delivered speeches claiming they would bring back black money from foreign accounts within 100 days of Modi Government. Now that 99 days are over, Modi's government has not brought back even Rs 1 stashed in foreign banks," John told reporters in New Delhi."Instead of going to Japan, PM Narendra Modi should have gone to Switzerland so that he would discuss the issue of black money stashed in banks there," he saidNSUI is&nbsp;organising nationwide protests over the issue in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Kolkata."Rajnath Singh had on April 17 this year said in Thane that his party would bring back black money stashed in foreign accounts within 100 days if they come to power. But BJP has completely failed to bring back this money," NSUI national spokesperson Amrish Ranjan Pandey said.Police had to erect barricades outside Rajnath's house to prevent protestors from entering inside.As they refused to budge, police detained some NSUI leaders, including John, and took them to Parliament Street police station.PTI
