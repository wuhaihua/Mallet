Republicans And Democrats Use Labor Day Holiday To Bash Each Other Republicans And Democrats Use Labor Day Holiday To Bash Each Other &nbsp;&nbsp;						
	National Republicans and Democrats are celebrating Labor Day by bashing each other.
In dueling statements released by the party committees Monday, the national chairmen marked the holiday by blaming the opposing party for pushing policies that hurt America’s workers heading into this year&#8217;s midterm elections.
&#8220;It should be our priority to remove the roadblocks to job creation,&#8221; Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and his co-chairman said Monday. &#8220;So on this Labor Day, I call on Harry Reid and his fellow Democrats to do their job, pass those jobs bills, and get Americans back to work. I doubt they will, which is yet another reason for Americans to elect new Republican leaders in November who will fight for jobs and for workers.&#8221;
&#8220;I am proud that the Democratic Party is working with American workers to achieve the next set of policies that hardworking Americans deserve, including an increased minimum wage, paycheck fairness, and improved family and medical leave policies,&#8221; Democratic National Committee chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said. &#8220;Republicans have not only opposed these policies, but sought to diminish the capacity of unions to represent the interests of workers.&#8221;
Here is the full statement released by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and co-chairman Sharon Day:
&#8220;Hard work made America a great nation, and on Labor Day we pay tribute to the American worker and the tireless work ethic that built our economy,&#8221; said Chairman Priebus.
&#8220;Today is about honoring all who labor—on farms and in factories, offices, schools and stores. We should strive to pass the values of hard work on to the next generation, and we should strive to ensure that every American who wants and needs a job can find one.
&#8220;Right now, there are millions of Americans who desperately want to work but can’t find a job. They&#8217;re exhausted from looking for jobs that don&#8217;t exist. So it&#8217;s disappointing that Harry Reid and President Obama continue to reject bipartisan jobs bills passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives—including legislation to build the Keystone Pipeline.

&#8220;It should be our priority to remove the roadblocks to job creation. So on this Labor Day, I call on Harry Reid and his fellow Democrats to do their job, pass those jobs bills, and get Americans back to work. I doubt they will, which is yet another reason for Americans to elect new Republican leaders in November who will fight for jobs and for workers.&#8221;
&#8220;I want to wish all Americans a Happy Labor Day,&#8221; said Co-Chairman Day. &#8220;Many of us have traveled this weekend or will spend time at parades and barbecues, but no matter what we&#8217;re doing today—whether work or leisure &#8212; let&#8217;s remember that part of what makes America an exceptional nation is our workforce. Let&#8217;s commit ourselves to strengthening our workforce, advancing equal opportunity for all, and putting the American Dream in reach for everyone.&#8221;
Here is the full statement released by Democratic National Committee chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz:
&#8220;Today, many Americans will celebrate Labor Day with their friends and families. Countless others will go to work and do their job just like any other day.
&#8220;Every American worker has contributed to building America into what it is today and what it can be in the future. But one Monday in September is not sufficient recognition of their contributions. There is no good reason why any American who works hard day in and day out should have to raise their family in poverty. With women acting as the primary breadwinner in 40 percent of households with children, unequal pay hurts women, their families, and our economy.
&#8220;Organized labor in America is responsible for securing many of the workplace standards and protections that we take for granted, from child labor to weekends. I am proud that the Democratic Party is working with American workers to achieve the next set of policies that hardworking Americans deserve, including an increased minimum wage, paycheck fairness, and improved family and medical leave policies. Republicans have not only opposed these policies, but sought to diminish the capacity of unions to represent the interests of workers.
&#8220;This year marks 120 years since Labor Day was first recognized as a federal holiday in 1894. In that time, we&#8217;ve made extraordinary progress to restore to workers the dignity to which each of us is entitled. It is critical that our nation remain steadfast in that commitment moving forward if we are to be an America where economic security and opportunity are available to all.&#8221;
