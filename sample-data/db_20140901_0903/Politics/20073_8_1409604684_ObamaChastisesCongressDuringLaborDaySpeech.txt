These policies and others &quot;have two things in common: They're going to help more working families get ahead, and the Republicans who run our Congress oppose almost all of them,&quot; the president said.&quot;They say no to everything,&quot; Obama said, drawing &quot;boos&quot; directed at Congress from the crowd. &quot;Don't boo, vote,&quot; he countered. Looking toward midterms, Obama said, &quot;there are plenty of folks who count on you to get cynical and not vote.&quot; Obama urged the crowd to, instead, &quot;rise together ... despite the opposition.&quot;IN-DEPTHJoe Biden Pushes Union Strength in Detroit Labor Day Speech'So Sue Me': Why President Obama Is Embracing a Fight With CongressSOCIAL— Elisha Fieldstadt
