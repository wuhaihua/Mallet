Govt acceptance of SC decision on coal scam is good governance, says Ravi Shankar Prasad Govt acceptance of SC decision on coal scam is good governance, says Ravi Shankar Prasad 
					New Delhi: The government's decision to accept the Supreme Court's decision to term the coal block allocation since 1993 as illegal is an example of good governance, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said today."We said we accept your decision. Please consider the 46 mines where production is about to start. We said you decide whether to stop it or not... it was a straight answer. No hanky-panky, no corruption," he said terming it as an example of good governance and clarity of thoughts of the Modi government.Referring to the achievements of the NDA government in 100 days, he said opening of over one crore bank accounts for financial inclusion of all Indians was a major step.But former Union minister and senior Congress leader Manish Tewari had different views. He said the rise in incidents of communal violence and failure of the government to check prices could not be ignored.CPI-M leader Mohd Salim said opening accounts was not enough as India is one country where some people have crores in their banks and some have nothing.They were participating in a discussion at a conclave organised by Aaj Tak on 100 days of Modi government.In the course of the discussion, Prasad rejected charges that most decisions were being taken by the PMO.He said while ministers were at liberty to take decisions, they were free to approach the PMO to clear doubts. He said the final decision should always rest with the Prime Minister. He said it was case with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and is the same under Narendra Modi.Tewari said the decision of the government to pull out of Foreign Secretary level talks with Pakistan was a "180 degree U turn" as Modi had invited Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony.PTI
