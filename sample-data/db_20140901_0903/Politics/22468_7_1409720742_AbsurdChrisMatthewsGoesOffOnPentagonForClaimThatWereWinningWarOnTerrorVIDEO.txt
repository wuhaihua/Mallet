‘Absurd’: Chris Matthews Goes Off On Pentagon For Claim That We’re Winning War On Terror [VIDEO] ‘Absurd’: Chris Matthews Goes Off On Pentagon For Claim That We’re Winning War On Terror [VIDEO] Liberal MSNBC host Chris Matthews ranted against Pentagon spokesman John Kirby for his claim that America has had &#8220;very good success&#8221; in battling Islamic terrorism, calling it &#8220;an absurd statement&#8221; and declaring that &#8220;we&#8217;re not winning the war against terrorism over there.&#8221;
Matthews reacted incredulously to the rear admiral&#8217;s assertion on Tuesday that we&#8217;re winning the war against Islamic fundamentalism &#8212; the very same day that ISIS released a second video showing them beheading American journalist Steven Sotloff in Iraq.
&#8220;Of course, that&#8217;s an absurd statement he just made,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Because we went into Iraq, blew the country apart, created the opportunity for ISIS to grow &#8212; it grew out of where was nothing &#8212; a much bigger and a larger threat to us than anything we faced from Saddam Hussein. So the idea that we&#8217;ve been on the aggressor side here, that we&#8217;ve been winning this war against terrorism, is ludicrous.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;re facing a new danger now that is going after our people over there,&#8221; Matthews continued, cutting of his guest. &#8220;Which is threatening to become an actual country. And no one seems willing to take it on in the entire region! And we&#8217;re not taking it on! How can you say we&#8217;re winning like he just said, the admiral just said!?&#8221;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that statement,&#8221; he went on, interrupting his guest again. &#8220;I guess he has to say that kind of stuff because of his position. But we&#8217;re not winning the war against terrorism over there.&#8221;
