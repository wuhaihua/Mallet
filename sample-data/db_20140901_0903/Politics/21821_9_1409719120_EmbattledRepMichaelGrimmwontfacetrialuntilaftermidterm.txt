Embattled Rep. Michael Grimm won't face trial until after midterm Embattled Rep. Michael Grimm won't face trial until after midterm Embattled Rep. Michael Grimm will not face trial until after his November midterm - a small silver lining for the vulnerable New York Republican as he tries to defend himself against an indictment on 20 charges including tax fraud and employing undocumented immigrants.Grimm's trial will begin Dec. 1, several weeks after New York voters visit polling places. He's pleaded not guilty to all charges, which center on the management of a Manhattan health food restaurant he owned before entering Congress."When the dust settles, he will be vindicated," Grimm's attorney William McGinley has argued. "Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent."McGinley has dismissed the charges as nothing more than "a politically driven vendetta" against Grimm, an unlikely Republican in a blue-leaning district.But the ride to reelection remains rocky for Grimm. Even ahead of his indictment, the swing-district representative faced stiff reelection prospects against challenger Domenic Recchia, a former New York City councilman. He was caught on tape threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony for inquiring about campaign finance allegations.Still, Grimm has vowed to ignore his dried-up campaign coffers, mounting a fight for his Staten Island and South Brooklyn constituents in an effort to remain New York City's lone GOP congressman.
