The House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution with language to defund U.S. President Barack Obama's national health care plan yesterday, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated the U.S. Senate will not consider the legislation as passed by the House.

His performance meant Democrats avoided a replay of their 2012 disaster, when the party failed to win either of the top two spots despite this San Bernardino district’s Obama-friendly electorate. In the wake of the retirement of GOP Rep. Gary Miller, Aguilar, the mayor of Redlands, looks like a favorite against Paul Chabot, a businessman whom Democrats hope to paint as a Tea Party extremist.
