	An Islamic militia has claimed it &#8220;secured&#8221; a compound belonging to the United States Embassy in the Libyan capitol of Tripoli, coming nearly two years after the attack on Benghazi that killed U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens.
The militia, the Islamist Dawn of Libya, says it took over the compound last week and video surfaced Sunday of militants diving into the residential compound&#8217;s pool, according to the Associated Press.

The group invited onlookers to the facility this weekend to view how they are maintaining the former American property. An Associated Press correspondent reported the building was in fairly good condition and appeared occupied.
The U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Deborah Jones, tweeted that the video appeared to be shot from the U.S. embassy compound.
Dawn of Libya, while avowedly Islamist, is not connected to the more radicalÂ Ansar al-Shariah, which is believed to be the group behind the fatal Benghazi terrorist attack. The embassy compound was evacuated July 26 due to escalating fighting in the wartorn country.
The Islamic militia reportedly in control of the compound has also claimed control of Tripoli and its international airport.
