Boehner On Obama's ISIS Non-Strategy Boehner On Obama's ISIS Non-Strategy &nbsp;&nbsp;						
	Republican House Speaker John Boehner said that President Obama would need to ask Congress for authority to go to war with ISIS and that the president &#8220;clearly&#8221; has no strategy to deal with the terrorist group in either Iraq or Syria.
&#8220;I think under existing authorizations from the Congress, he has the ability to do this in Iraq,&#8221; Boehner said Tuesday night in a phone interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt&#8217;s fill-in, California Rep. John Campbell. The interview occurred shortly after ISIS released a video showing its beheading of a second American journalist.
&#8220;It&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s questionable whether he has the authority to do this in Syria,&#8221; Boehner said. &#8220;You know, the threat from ISIS goes back well over a year. And the crisis in Syria&#8217;s been going on now for over two years. And we&#8217;ve asked the president, asked the president what is your strategy to deal with Syria. And clearly, there&#8217;s no strategy that&#8217;s developed there.&#8221;
&#8220;Until the president is willing to lay out a plan, the Congress has very few options ahead of it,&#8221; Boehner said.
&#8220;Well, the president has provided the notification of some of these strikes, even in Iraq, because there&#8217;s some ambiguity there in terms of how much authority in Iraq did he have. But if he&#8217;s going after ISIS, he would have, I think he would have to provide a war powers notification to the Congress. And then it would be up to the House to make a decision about whether we dealt with the issue or not,&#8221; Boehner added.
