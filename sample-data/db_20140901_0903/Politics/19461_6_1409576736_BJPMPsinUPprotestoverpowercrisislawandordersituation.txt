					Lucknow: BJP MPs from Uttar Pradesh today staged a day-long dharna in Lucknow as part of a state-wide agitation against alleged power crisis and poor law and order situation in the state.Around 50 MPs from the state, led by president of UP unit, Laxmi Kant Bajpai staged a dharna at the GPO Park in Hazratganj to protest against "power crisis, poor law and order situation and other public issues", BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.Accusing Akhilesh government of neglecting BJP MPs, Bajpai alleged that officers were not taking cognisance of the local problems being raised by them."The state is facing flood and drought situations, power crisis is worsening day by day, but Akhilesh government which is involved in appeasement politics is overlooking the plight of the people," he alleged.He said that BJP would protest against "anti-people policies" of the government at every level.BJP had won 71 out of 80 seats during Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year.Addressing the dharna, Bajpai alleged that ever since the Akhilesh Yadav government has come to power, law and order has "hit rock bottom" and there was "spurt in henious crimes, including rape, murder, loot and abduction".He further alleged that incidents of atrocities against women and girls have "created a record" in the country.National General Secretary, Ram Shanker Katheria alleged that due to vote-bank politics of the government, "several riots have taken place" one after another.He said that repeated incidents of crimes against women have brought disrepute to the state.Attacking the government, he said the government has failed on expectations of the people and the SP government was venting its frustration by neglecting BJP MPs.Pathak said similar dharnas were held at the district-level by local units. The decision to stage state-wide dharna was taken during the state executive meeting held in Vrindavan last month.PTI
