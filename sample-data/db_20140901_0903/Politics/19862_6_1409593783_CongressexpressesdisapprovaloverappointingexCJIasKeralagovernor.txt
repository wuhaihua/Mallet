					New Delhi: As Centre's reported move to appoint former Chief Justice of India Justice P Sathasivam as
Kerala Governor sparked a debate, Congress today signalled its disapproval."It is best I am restrained on such sensitive matters from this podium. As there is no actual appointment letter has been issued, all I can say is that the exalted position of former Chief Justice of India to have meddled in such post is regrettable. It is inappropriate for the giver and the receiver," party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.Singhvi, who is himself a senior advocate, was asked whether a former CJI would be becoming a governor for the first time if the appointment comes about and whether it was proper for Sathasivam to accept such an office.The AICC's reaction came even as reports from Thiruvanthapuram had it that the move has generated a debate in political and legal circles in the state on the propriety of giving gubernatorial assignment to a person who retired from the highest judicial office in the country.While Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the Centre had so far not sought his views on the proposal, KPCC president VM Sudheeran said the issue involved questions of "propriety" but it was for legal and constitutional experts to give answers to them.PTI
