Maha BJP denies differences with Shiv Sena over seat sharing Maha BJP denies differences with Shiv Sena over seat sharing 
					Mumbai: The BJP in Maharashtra today said it was yet to finalise seat-sharing agreement with the Shiv Sena for the ensuing Assembly elections and dismissed reports of differences between the saffron allies over pre-poll pact.The state BJP also said the party will work according to the template set by National President Amit Shah amid indications that it is eyeing more Assembly seats than what it contested in 2009."We have invited Amit Shah to Mumbai as he has not visited Mumbai after assuming the post of BJP chief. We also want to show him the Ganpati festival being celebrated in Mumbai and also discuss the upcoming elections with him. We will work according to the guidelines set by him," state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis said here.He was talking to reporters at BJP office in suburban Mumbai on the margins of a meeting of state BJP Parliamentary Board. The meet was also attended by Leaders of Opposition in Assembly and Council Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde, respectively.Dismissing reports of a tug-of-war between BJP and Shiv Sena over distribution of seats in the key State, where Congress and NCP are in power for 15 years, Fadnavis said there is no problem between the over two decade-old allies."We haven't had final discussions over seat-sharing till now. So there is no question of any problem between us," said Fadnavis, seen by many as BJP's potential Chief Ministerial candidate.BJP leaders have toured every district of Maharashtra to get the ground-level feedback from local workers and a report has been submitted to the state leadership, said the 44-year-old MLA from Vidarbha, who is known for his organising and oratory skills.Shiv Sena, the senior partner at the State level, had contested 169 seats in 2009 Assembly polls, while BJP fielded candidates in 119 segments.Buoyed by its showing in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP is reportedly asking for more seats this time around for the election to 288-member House due in a couple of months.PTI
