		India's fastest bowler Varun&nbsp;Aaron has started his 10-day training programme under Aussie&nbsp;legend Glenn McGrath at the MRF Pace Foundation as part of a&nbsp;tie-up between the BCCI and company.
The BCCI, in a strategic tie-up with MRF, has announced a&nbsp;10-day camp for some of the talented pacers but the spotlight&nbsp;will be on speed merchant Aaron, who will be working under&nbsp;McGrath, to iron out the chinks in his bowling as well as&nbsp;learning about the tricks of bowling on pitches Down Under.
India will be playing four Test matches while Aaron will&nbsp;also be eyeing to make a comeback into the ODI team.

Along with Aaron, two other notable names training at the&nbsp;foundation are Ishwar Pandey, who has been a part of the&nbsp;Indian touring party in New Zealand and England, and India&nbsp;discard Ashoke Dinda.
McGrath, who has taken over from Dennis Lillee as the&nbsp;chief coach of India's premier pace bowling factory, had&nbsp;earlier worked with Aaron and Pandey. McGrath considers Pandey&nbsp;as one of the most talented swing bowlers in the country at&nbsp;the moment.
"Dinda, for his part has developed a lot of technical flaws in his bowling apart from being one-dimensional in his&nbsp;approach. He has been advised to have a stint under McGrath,&nbsp;who can work on his flaws before the Ranji Trophy comes&nbsp;calling in December," a source in know of the developments&nbsp;told PTI today.
"With Mohammed Shami unlikely to be available due to&nbsp;national duty, an in-form Dinda is a must for Bengal," he&nbsp;added.
Some of the other pacers, who would be in the camp&nbsp;include Mumbai's fast medium bowler Shardul Thakur, who had&nbsp;impressed one and all during the last Ranji Trophy season.
There is Rajasthan's Deepak Chahar, who after a dream&nbsp;Ranji debut spell of 8/10 against Hyderabad, faded into&nbsp;oblivion due to poor form and injuries.
Jharkhand fast bowler Rahul Shukla and Railways' Anureet&nbsp;Singh, both of whom were a part of India A team in Australia&nbsp;recently, will also be working under McGrath.
Also, there is India U-19 medium pacer Chama Milind, who&nbsp;had represented the country in the last World Cup.
Bengal's reserve seamer Veer Pratap Singh, lanky UP&nbsp;bowler Ankit Rajput, who had played for CSK in the last IPL,&nbsp;will also be there among the bowlers.
