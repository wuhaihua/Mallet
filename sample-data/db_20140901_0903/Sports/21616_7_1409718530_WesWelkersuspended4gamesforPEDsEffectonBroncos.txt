                    Wes Welker has been suspended four games for violating the NFL&#39;s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. mutilple outlets reported on Monday. Welker was banned for the first month of the 2014 regular season because he tested positive for amphetamines.

According to Fox Sports&#39; Jay Glazer, the Broncos &quot;have known about Welker&#39;s suspension&quot; since before traiing camp and were &quot;holding out hope&quot; it would be turned over on appeal. Five days before the season is to kickoff at home for them against Indianapolis, we know that&#39;s no longer an option.

Welker just got cleared from a late preseason concussion and was on track to play Week 1 before&nbsp;facing this&nbsp;forced setback out of the lineup for multiple weeks.

There&#39;s a perception that Welker is a vital part of the Broncos&#39; passing game. He is, to a degree. Welker scored 10 touchdowns working in his first season with Peyton Manning in 13 games, but it came with big drops in catches (73) and yards (778) from his best New England Patriots day.

Welker, 33, can be replaced, and so will his production. This just means an uptick for Demaryius Thomas and Julius Thomas as Manning&#39;s red zone passing threats. Emmanuel Sanders will be the No. 2 wideout Manning relies upon all over the field, and was ahead of Welker in the pecking order, too.

Rookie Cody Latimer may not be quite ready as a No. 4 and is better suited for the outside, but Andre Caldwell will continue to be a good utility man to get Welker&#39;s slot work. The Broncos can also compensate by getting second tight end Jacob Tamme more on the field with Thomas.

Welker needed more to stay on the field to hold his ground in this crowded receiving corps considering his age and him being a free agent again in 2015. The diminished returns already were there, and the Broncos are good in shape without him. His&nbsp;suspension just further clouds Welker&#39;s NFL playing future beyond &#39;14 -- on top of the multiple head injuries.
