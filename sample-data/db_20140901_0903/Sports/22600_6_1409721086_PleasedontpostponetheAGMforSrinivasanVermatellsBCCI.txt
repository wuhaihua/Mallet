Please don't postpone the AGM for Srinivasan, Verma tells BCCI Please don't postpone the AGM for Srinivasan, Verma tells BCCI 
										
		New Delhi: The petitioner in the IPL spot-fixing scandal Aditya Verma today urged BCCI's interim president Shivlal Yadav to conduct the board's Annual General Meeting in September as per the convention of India's richest sporting body.
The Mukul Mudgal committee yesterday got an extension to complete the IPL probe with the Supreme Court ordering N Srinivasan to stay away from discharging his duties as BCCI president.

There is every possibility that the AGM will be postponed giving the Tamil Nadu strongman opportunity to come clean and take back president's chair as there is virtually no opposition in the BCCI ranks.
Verma, in his letter has written, "A section of the officials, if the reports are to be believed, have chalked out a plan to postpone the BCCI Annual General Meeting (AGM) indefinitely. It is a clear conspiracy to keep the BCCI elections hanging till Srinivasan gets any relief from the Supreme Court."
"This arrangement, if comes true, will not only be an outright undemocratic act but will also be a dangerous precedence for the future of the cricket board."
Verma has urged the BCCI members to hold the AGM by September 30. "My humble request to all of you is kindly convene the AGM by September 30 and elect new office bearers as per the constitution of the great institution. Under no circumstances, the interest of an individual should be given preference over the entire cricket board. Moreover, I would also like to say that BCCI is not a personal property of N. Srinivasan," Verma was quoted saying in the letter circulated to the media.
