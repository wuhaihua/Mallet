EA Vault gives EA Access members new titles EA Vault gives EA Access members new titles EA SportsGaming   Next postPrev postUse your ← → (arrows) to browse  Electronic Arts has continued to work on making the EA Access subscription based service one worth being a part of.&nbsp; While criticized early for their debacle of the Madden 15 early access, as well as offering only a few titles, the company is putting their best foot forward.  Both NHL 15 and FIFA 15 will give subscribers access five days early, with Need for Speed: Rivals being added to the Vault. While EA Access experienced some early hiccups, numbers suggest that the service has rebounded just fine.&nbsp; Over 245,000 hours of Madden NFL 15 were played before the game released. NHL 15 is set to release in its full capacity on September 9, however, the title will be available starting September 4 for EA Access users.&nbsp; While Madden 15 was limited to six hours of gameplay, there have been no reports suggesting the same for this year&rsquo;s hockey title. FIFA 15 should see the same treatment in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; EA Access users should also notice that Need For Speed Rivals has been added to The Vault, giving them yet another title that is downloadable and playable as long as it remains there. EA Access has followed along the path of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as they initially came out.&nbsp; Very few titles were immediately available, and there were quite a few initial restrictions that have since been backed off on.&nbsp; At any rate, Electronic Arts has continued to build their EA Access service, and add value back to gamers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing not to be happy about here.
