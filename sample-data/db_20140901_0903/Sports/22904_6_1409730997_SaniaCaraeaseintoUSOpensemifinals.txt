Sania-Cara ease into US Open semifinals Sania-Cara ease into US Open semifinals 
										
		Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza and&nbsp;her Zimbabwean partner Cara Black hardly broke a sweat as they&nbsp;entered the US Open women's doubles semifinals after their&nbsp;rivals retired midway through the quarterfinal match.
Sania and Cara, seeded third, defeated the Kazakh-Chinese&nbsp;pairing of Zarina Diyas and Yi-Fan Xu 6-1 1-0 (retd) in 45&nbsp;minutes to make the last four stage.

They will now face the Swiss-Italian team of Martina&nbsp;Hingis and Flavia Pennetta. Hingis and Pennetta upstaged&nbsp;fifth seeds Kveta Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik 6-4 6-3 in&nbsp;their last-eight match.
In a match which looked lopsided from the very start,&nbsp;Sania and Cara held serve and broke their rivals twice to&nbsp;pocket the opening set easily before the proceedings came to&nbsp;an end in the opening five minutes of the second set.
In the junior competition, India's Sumit Nagal lost 2-6&nbsp;2-6 to seventh seeded Korean Duckhee Lee to bow out of the&nbsp;competition.
