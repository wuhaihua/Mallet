Luhukay surprised to win race for Kalou Luhukay surprised to win race for Kalou 
Jos Luhukay admitted he was surprised that "exceptional" striker Salomon Kalou opted to join Hertha Berlin from Lille.Ivory Coast international Kalou sealed a move to the Bundesliga on Sunday after being linked with several other clubs.
The 29-year-old joined Hertha for an undisclosed fee, reported to be €3million, and Luhukay believes his new recruit will prove to be a shrewd acquisition.
"He has extra qualities, is an exceptional player.” Hertha coach Luhukay told Bild.
"He has played for years [in the] Champions League. There is already surprising that we had a chance with him and he has chosen for us. 
"Kalou has all the qualities you can have.
"He is a player who has mobility, has unpredictability, has speed, goalscoring, also a good heading ability."
Kalou is away on international duty and the former Chelsea man could make his debut in the Bundesliga clash with Mainz next Saturday.
