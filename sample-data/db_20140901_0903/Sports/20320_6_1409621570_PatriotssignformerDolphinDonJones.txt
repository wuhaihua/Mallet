Patriots sign former Dolphin Don Jones Patriots sign former Dolphin Don Jones September 1, 2014, 7:45 pm The Patriots plucked second-year safety Don Jones off waivers on Monday and will now tie him to a metal chair in a windowless room lit by one flickering bulb. They will press him for information about Miami's defensive game plan. And he will talk. He WILL talk. Jones, a 5-11, 205-pounder from Arkansas State, was a seventh-round pick in 2013. 
As Miami defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle pointed out earlier on Monday, 
"We’ve known (the Patriots were the Week 1 opponent) since the spring and you’re always able to spend more time on your first opponent. ... Certain things that we worked on and certain things that we exposed [our players] to, I think they have a better feeling now than they would have if this was game five or six during the regular season.”
Early in the season, these debriefings have a lot of value because the preseason doesn't yield much if any valuable intel. The Patriots released Chris Barker, an offensive lineman, to make room for Jones.   The Patriots plucked second-year safety Don Jones off waivers on Monday and will now tie him to a metal chair in a windowless room lit by one flickering bulb.
