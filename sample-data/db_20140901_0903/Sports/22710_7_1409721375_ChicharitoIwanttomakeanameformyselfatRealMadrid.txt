                    Manchester United loanee Javier Hernandez is keen to prove that Real Madrid was right to sign him.

The Mexico international failed to nail down a regular spot in the United first team after joining in the summer of 2010 and signed for Carlo Ancelotti&#39;s side on a one-year loan deal Monday after passing his medical.

Hernandez says he is keen to get started and prove his worth at his new club and insists he doesn&#39;t feel pressure in following in the footsteps of compatriot Hugo Sanchez, who won five league titles in the seven years at the club.

&quot;I am delighted to be here and grateful to Real Madrid for giving me this chance. I will do everything I can to help the team. Playing for Real Madrid is a dream come true. Everybody in the world knows Real Madrid,&quot; Hernandez said at a news conference.

&quot;Hugo Sanchez had a great career here, but I want to do my own thing and make a name for myself. I will give my all to repay Madrid for the confidence shown in me. I want to win titles with Madrid. A big team cannot rely on one player. You need a team to be successful. And out of all the big clubs in the world, Real Madrid are the biggest.&quot;

The 26-year-old could make his official Madrid debut in the Liga match against at home against Atletico on Sept. 13 after the international break.
