                    BARCELONA, Spain &mdash; Lionel Messi picked up a leg injury in Barcelona&#39;s 1-0 win at Villarreal on Sunday.

Barcelona says its star forward hurt a muscle in his right leg and that he will undergo further tests on Monday to determine the severity of the injury.



Messi played the entire game against Villarreal and set up Sandro Ramirez for the winning goal in the 82nd minute.

Barcelona&#39;s young forward Munir El Haddadi received a knock on his right calf and will also have tests on Monday.

The 27-year-old Messi had a series of muscle injuries in 2013 after going several seasons without serious problems.
