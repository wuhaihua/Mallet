                    It wasn&#39;t that long ago that drafting a tight end with your first-round pick would get you laughed out of your league and probably scarred for life. Jimmy Graham paved the way for a new line of thinking though.

Taking a wide receiver with your first pick has become acceptable, and as the top option in one of the game&#39;s best offenses, Graham is essentially a No. 1 WR with TE eligibility. So, not only are you getting what figures to be top-12 production, you&#39;re getting a guy who has no equal at his position -- there isn&#39;t one other player in the league you can say that about.

1. Jimmy Graham, TE, Saints (No. 7). Call me crazy, but I had Graham ahead of Calvin Johnson because there isn&#39;t one other TE in Graham&#39;s tier.

2. Doug Martin, RB, Bucs (No. 17). I didn&#39;t want to play the guessing game at RB or be forced to dip into the dregs of position, so I gambled on a bounce back here.

3. Keenan Allen, WR, Chargers (No. 32). As good as Allen was last year, there&#39;s reason to expect even better in 2014. A year of experience plus some weapons to help alleviate some defensive attention should equal big things in 2014.

4. Toby Gerhart, RB, Jaguars (No. 41). This pick wasn&#39;t very exciting, but I expect heavy volume to make up for the lack of NFL Network highlights.

5. Matthew Stafford, QB, Lions (No. 56). I could have waited longer for a QB, but I like the idea of grabbing a guy in a great offense with a 5,000-yard, 40-TD season already on his resume.

6. Terrance Williams, WR, Cowboys (No. 65). I&#39;m expecting big things from the Cowboys offense in 2014, and as good as Dez Bryant will be, Tony Romo can&#39;t target him on every throw.

7. Fred Jackson, RB, Bills (No. 80). Father Time will catch up to him one day (probably this year since I&#39;ve finally allowed myself to draft him), but I&#39;m happy with him coming off my bench until that moment comes.

8. Jordan Reed, TE, Redskins (No. 89). Did I need another TE here? Probably not. Whatever though. At worst, he can fill in for Graham in Week 6.

9. Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers (No. 104). He&#39;s technically my WR3, but according to the &quot;Matt Lutovsky Method&quot;, I can consider him my TE since Graham is actually a WR1 &quot;type&quot;. His rookie numbers should be just fine for a &quot;TE&quot;.

10. Robert Griffin III, QB, Redskins (No. 113). I don&#39;t plan on playing RGIII much, but if bounces back from last year&#39;s down season he&#39;ll be a nice backup to have around.

11. Brian Hartline, WR, Dolphins (No. 128). Another Lutovsky special, Hartline isn&#39;t going to get you draft room props, but he&#39;ll be a nice WR fill in for bye weeks.

12. LeGarrette Blount, RB, Steelers (No. 137). I wanted to grab RBs early so that I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on Blount as more than a bye week fill in. At least he looks like the guy the Steelers will utilize him at the goal line.

13. Kenny Britt, WR, Rams (No. 152). Britt has always had talent, but injuries and stupidity held him back. He&#39;s healthy, and he&#39;s been less stupid of late, so perhaps this can be the breakout season. It didn&#39;t cost me anything to find out.

14. Bryce Brown, RB, Bills (No. 161). If Jackson runs out of gas or gets hurt, I&#39;ve still got a startable RB. In a sense, I handcuffed a backup. That isn&#39;t a recommended habit, but for now I&#39;ll run with.

15. Latavius Murray, RB, Raiders (No. 176). Do you expect Maurice Jones-Drew and Darren McFadden to be healthy and effective in 2014? Me neither.

16. Miles Austin, WR, Browns (No. 185). I&#39;ve since dropped him to pick up my kicker, but I think he&#39;s an interesting sleeper until his hamstring explodes.

17. Cleveland Browns D/ST (No. 200). The Browns coach who has a reputation as a strong defensive mind and some nice players on that side of the ball. This is one of my favorite units to target at the end of drafts.
