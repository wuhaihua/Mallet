Manny Pacquiao threw first pitch at Dodgers-Nationals Manny Pacquiao threw first pitch at Dodgers-Nationals LOS ANGELES â€“ After Manny Pacquiao delivered the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium Monday night, he ran into another prominent left-hander on the fifth floor.Pacuqiao posed with Sandy Koufax, who, like the welterweight champion, isn't seen at Dodger Stadium every day."I'm just an old player," Koufax explained to Pacquiao.It wrapped up a typically hectic day in the life of a globa  athlete, especially when he is in the business of promoting a pay-per-view fight.Pacquiao meets undefeated Chris Algieri in Macau on Nov. 22. The two have toured Macau, Shanghai, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Los Angeles and will hit New York, and they actually seem to be getting along.Algieri has taken the Ice Bucket Challenge and passed it along to Pacquiao, and the two have dueled in bowling, batting (at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco) and pop-a-shot. Algieri is 3-0 so far, including the pop-a-shot competition at ESPN headquarters in downtown L.A earlier Monday.Next, Algieri wants to take on Pacquiao in chess, which Pac-Man takes so seriously that he flies in master-level players for competition.Pacquiao visited the Dodger clubhouse before the first pitch and posed, with boxing gloves, with Adrian Gonzalez. Matt Kemp pretended to approach Pacquiao with a bat, and Pacquiao also posed with Yasiel Puig.Right after he and Koufax interacted, he ran into ex-Laker and TV actor Rick Fox, who promised to be in Macau for the fight.The champ wore a No. 8 Dodger jersey onto the field, signifying the number of world championships he has won.His day started at Fox Sports, where he filmed a bit for the network's NFL pre-game show. His ride left Century Plaza hotel at 11 a.m., and left him at his house in Hancock Park at 6 p.m."And now he's going to take a nap," said his manager, Michael Koncz."No nap," Pacquiao said emphatically. "I'm going to sleep."
