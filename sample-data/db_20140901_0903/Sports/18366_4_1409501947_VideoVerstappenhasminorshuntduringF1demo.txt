Max Verstappen's first public Formula 1 demo didn't go exactly how he had imagined in his head after he hit the barriers, damaging the front-wing of the Toro Rosso liveried Red Bull RB8.
The 16-year-old, who recently signed a deal to race for Toro Rosso next year, was driving the RB8 as part of a Rotterdam demonstration when he failed to brake in time for the barrier, damaging the front of the car.
