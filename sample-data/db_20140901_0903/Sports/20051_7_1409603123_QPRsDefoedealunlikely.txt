			Jermain Defoe is unlikely to join Queens Park Rangers on deadline day but chairman Tony Fernandes remains optimistic a deal can be done in January.Defoe, 31, has been keen to return to the Premier League after failing to settle at Major League Soccer side Toronto and Sky sources understand both Rangers and Leicester have enquired about the former England striker.However, Toronto are reluctant to let him leave the club while they are competing in MLS’s play-offs and would demand a significant fee just several months after signing him from Tottenham.Speaking to Sky Sports outside Loftus Road as QPR also look to finalise a deal for Spurs midfielder Sandro, Fernandes said: “There’s a will from both sides to do a deal.“It’s just about whether or not they’ll allow him to leave while they’re in the play-offs.“We’ve known Jermain for a long time, if we can’t do something now then I’m sure something can be done in January.”
