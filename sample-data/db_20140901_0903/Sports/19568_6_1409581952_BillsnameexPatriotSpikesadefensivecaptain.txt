Bills name ex-Patriot Spikes a defensive captain Bills name ex-Patriot Spikes a defensive captain September 1, 2014, 9:30 am No one ever thought of Brandon Spikes as a leader when he was in New England . . . but that's not how they see him in Buffalo.
The free-spirited Spikes, who was never a match for the buttoned-up culture of the tight-lipped Patriots, was one of six players named captain by the Bills this morning. The others are cornerback Corey Graham, running back Fred Jackson, defensive tackle Kyle Williams, defensive end Mario Williams and center Eric Wood.
Spikes has toned down his anti-Pats rhetoric -- which flowed freely immediately after his March signing with Buffalo -- since training camp opened, but he's clearly happier with the Bills than he ever was with New England. And, judging by today's announcement, they're just as happy to have him.
