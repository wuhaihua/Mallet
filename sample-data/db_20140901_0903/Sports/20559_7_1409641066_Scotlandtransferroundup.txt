			Celtic finally sealed the protracted transfer of striker Stefan Scepovic from Sporting Gijon on a Â£2m deal in the dramatic final hours of the summer transfer window.Talks over the move began last Friday, and Celtic were confident they had signed the Serbia international - only for the deal to apparently fall through.Getafe looked set to secure the 24-year-old, but the proposed deal collapsed because of Spanish financial fair play rules and Scepovic then apparently had a change of heart and chose to make the move to Glasgow.There remains some confusion over whether the Hoops also completed a loan deal for Manchester City striker John Guidetti, who was at Celtic Park for talks - but there has been no confirmation as yet from either club.Meanwhile, Celtic released four strikers with Amido Balde joining Beveren, Teemu Pukki and Holmbert Fridjonsson both moving to Danish side Brondby, all on season-long loans, while Bahrudin Atajic, who made four first-team appearances, was released.And another player leaving Celtic Park was Dylan McGeouch, who moved to Championship club Hibernian on loan until the end of the season.Hibs, who failed in a bid to re-sign Leigh Griffiths on loan from the Hoops, have also brought in 19-year-old Southampton striker Jake Sinclair on a season-long loan.His signing came after it was confirmed that Hibs forward Faird El Alagui had ruptured his Achilles tendon, which will keep him out for most, if not all of the season.Jackson Irvine also left Celtic on a season-long loan, becoming one of three Ross County signings days after their management team of Derek and George Adams were sacked.Dundee United forward Michael Gardyne re-signed on loan while Darren Barr signed following his release by Kilmarnock.Partick Thistle signed 23-year-old former Liverpool and Blackpool striker Nathan Eccleston, while Falkirk signed Aberdeen full-back Joe Shaughnessy on loan until January and winger David Smith from Hearts on a two-year deal.Hearts loaned striker Gary Oliver to Stenhousemuir until January while goalkeeper Lee Hollis left Tynecastle.Dundee defender Kyle Benedictus joined Alloa on a season-long loan while goalkeeper Grant Adam left Dens Park.Cash-strapped Rangers loaned out seven young players, most of them with first-team experience, until the turn of the year.Striker Calum Gallagher joined Cowdenbeath, midfielders Robbie Crawford (Morton), Tom Walsh (Stenhousemuir) and Barrie McKay (Raith Rovers) moved out, while there were new assignments for defenders Danny Stoney (Stranraer), Luca Gasparotto (Airdrie) and Craig Halkett (Clyde).
