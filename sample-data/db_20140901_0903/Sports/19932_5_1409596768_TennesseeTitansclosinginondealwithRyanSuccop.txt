Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY SportsNFL    It&rsquo;s quite rare when an NFL kicker makes a headline but so much has been made about the release of veteran and ex-Kansas City Chief&rsquo;s kicker Ryan Succop that you can&rsquo;t simply let it go. Succop has been speaking with the Tennessee Titans since &nbsp;he was waived by Kansas City on Saturday. Now according to Jason LaCanfora, he is about to become a Titan.  Titans deal with Succup should be announced sometime today. &mdash; Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) September 1, 2014 Succop was in a battle for his job throughout training camp with Cairo Santos a Brazillian born kicker who played at Tulane on the collegiate level. Succop was set to earn $2 million with the Kansas City Chiefs this season while Santos will now cost the team $422,000. The Titans have been looking for a replacement for Rob Bironas who was released in March after nine seasons with the Titans. Over the course of the last few weeks, the Titans have worked out veterans Jay Feely, Garrett Hartley, and Rian Lindell. If the Titans do in fact reach a deal, and it sounds like one is very close, Succop will face his former teammates on opening day. The Titans opted to go with Travis Coons as their kicker when they paired down to 53. Coons was 2-3 in the pre-season. In his five year NFL career, Succop has 119 of his 147 attempts. He has never missed an extra point attempt. He has also seen five of his attempts blocked over the same career period. At 27 years of age, Succop could be the answer to the Titans kicking issues for a few more years, easily. &nbsp;
