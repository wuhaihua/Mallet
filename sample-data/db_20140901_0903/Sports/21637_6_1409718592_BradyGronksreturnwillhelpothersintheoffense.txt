Brady: Gronk's return will help others in the offense Brady: Gronk's return will help others in the offense September 2, 2014, 10:45 am Rob Gronkowski surprised reporters Monday when he announced he would be active and on the field for Sunday's season opener in Miami.
Suffice it to say, it was good news for Tom Brady and the Patriots offense.
"Well, I hope [Gronkowski will play]," Brady said to WEEI on Tuesday morning. "The more guys we can have out there, the better. We just started the week of practice, so I think everyone’s trying to get out there, learn each other. The final roster has finally been picked, and whoever's on the active roster really has to be ready to go. We’re going to need contributions from everybody. If Gronk can be one of those guys, then I think that makes our team better."
The numbers say that it does. In the red zone last season, the Patriots with Gronk had a 69 percent efficiency rate, whereas when Gronk was out that number dropped to 43.5 percent. Despite dealing with a variety of injuries that has caused him to miss 14 games over the last two seasons, he's remained a touchdown-scoring machine when he's available. In 50 career games, he has 42 career scores.
Brady knows how significant Gronkowski's return will be for him and the rest of his offense. The 6-foot-6 tight end's presence on the field has a way of opening things up for other receivers.
"Him being a teammate for the last, I don’t know, four years, we know what he can bring to the team, what his ability is when he’s out there, what he’s capable of," Brady said. "Not only his own ability, but how that helps the other guys, too. Because it’s hard to put one guy on him and just think that guy can hold up all game. So then you may get more zone coverage, then you may get double coverage. They’re going to figure out their schemes to stop your best player. That’s what good defenses do, they try to identify what an offense’s strength is, and then they’ve got to shut that down. We have to try to identify what a defense’s strengths are and shut those things down.
"We’ve got a good group of guys. If they’re going to cover Gronk, then we’ve got to throw to the other guys. And when he’s out there, he’s obviously a great target because of his size, his speed, his agility, his ability to catch the football in traffic. That’s what he’s done over the course of his career. That’s why he’s got so many touchdowns, because he’s got such a big catch radius that you put the ball in certain areas and he can go up and make the play."
One of those other options in the passing game could be new tight end Tim Wright, who was acquired in the trade that sent Logan Mankins to Tampa Bay last week. While Wright participated in New England's preseason game with the Giants late last week on short notice, he only got his first full Patriots practice in on Monday and so it's unclear how much he'll be able to contribute over the weekend in Miami.
Brady said he remembered seeing a lot of Wright on film last year. While the Patriots studied NFC South defenses last year, there was No. 81 on Tampa Bay consistently making plays against the likes of the Saints and the Panthers.
"I said, ‘Who is this young No. 81 that looks like a good player?’ I’m excited to have him on our team," Brady said. "He’s a good player. I know the other night in the game [watching] from the sideline he was making a lot of plays out there. Hopefully he can go out there and keep making them."
