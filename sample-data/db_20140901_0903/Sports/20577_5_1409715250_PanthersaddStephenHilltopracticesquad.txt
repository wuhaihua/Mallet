Panthers add Stephen Hill to practice squad Panthers add Stephen Hill to practice squad Sep 22, 2013; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Jets wide receiver Stephen Hill (84) celebrates after a touchdown against the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Stephen Hill found a new home in a likely place. The former New York Jet signed with the Carolina Panthers on Tuesday to play on their practice squad, via ESPN.com&rsquo;s Adam Caplan.  The Panthers had a notorious need for wide receiver, and they were rumored to be eyeing Hill after they worked him out. Still, he&nbsp;won&rsquo;t suddenly become an impact player. He was with the Jets two years and couldn&rsquo;t make an impact. He will, however, be given a second chance in the NFL. And it&rsquo;s a very good chance with plenty of room for upward mobility. The Panthers drafted Kelvin Benjamin to line up across from new signee Jerricho Cotchery. Other receivers on the depth chart include Jason Avant, Brenton Bersin and Corey Brown, via Ourlads.com. If Hill finds a way to use his touted athleticism on the football field,&nbsp;then he could fight his way off the practice roster and onto the team&rsquo;s game day roster. Hill&rsquo;s agent was vocal about his belief that Hill will eventually be a force in the league. The agent claimed that Jets&rsquo; head coach Rex Ryan&nbsp;never gave the young wide receiver a legitimate change of development with the Jets&rsquo; carousel of poor quarterbacks. Stephen Hill has caught 45 of his 106 targets for 594 for four touchdowns in his two-year career. He was a former second-round pick of the Jets.
