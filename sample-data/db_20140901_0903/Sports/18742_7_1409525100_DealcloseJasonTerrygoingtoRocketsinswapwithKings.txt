                    Guard Jason Terry is headed back to Texas, where he had his best success as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. Word Sunday had him en route to the Houston Rockets.

Terry, 36, reportedly will be dealt from the Sacramento Kings in a cap-room trade, according to CBS Sports.

Headed to Sacramento: Alonzo Gee and picks. In addition to Terry, the Rockets will get two second-round picks, according to Yahoo! Sports.

After eight seasons with the Mavericks, Terry joined the Boston Celtics as a free agent in 2012. He was the NBA&#39;s Sixth Man of the Year in 2009 and 2011, a sign of his expected role with the Rockets.

The deal promises to continue stirring the fire between the two Lone Star State rivals. Terry also could find success in the Rockets&#39; up-tempo offense while helping fill a need for a guard with playoff experience.

Gee might not last long in Sacramento, where observers believe the Kings will waive him to free up cap space.
