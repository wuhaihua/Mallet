                    The Texans are showing J.J. Watt the love and the money.

Houston has agreed to a six-year, $100 million contract with their All-Pro defensive end that includes $51.876 million in guaranteed money, the Houston Chronicle&#39;s John McClain reported early Tuesday. McClain reported&nbsp;the deal will make&nbsp;Watt the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL, surpassing&nbsp;the $96 million contract former Texans end Mario Williams received from the Bills.



Watt, 25, had two years plus the franchise tag remaining on his rookie contract. He recorded 10.5 sacks last season, about half his NFL-high 20.5 sacks in 2012. His tackle total remained steady, with 65 in 2013 compared with 69 in 2012. He also has recovered two fumbles in each of his first three pro seasons. He has not missed a game (regular season or playoffs)&nbsp;in his career.

This year, Watt will be paired with No. 1 overall draft&nbsp;pick Jadeveon Clowney. The Texans are banking on the tandem putting big-time pressure on quarterbacks.
