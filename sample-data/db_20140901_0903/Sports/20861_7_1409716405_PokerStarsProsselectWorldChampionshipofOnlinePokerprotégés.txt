                    Team PokerStars Pros Vanessa Selbst, Bertrand &ldquo;ElkY&rdquo; Grospellier, Andre Akkari and Eugene Katchalov recently selected their official Prot&eacute;g&eacute;s for the upcoming World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP).

The choices are the outcome of special freeroll tournaments along with a social media campaign conducted by the site which invited players from around the globe to submit video content explaining why they should be singled-out to receive Prot&eacute;g&eacute; status.



Robert Glenister of the United Kingdom, Allan Justino of Brazil, Russia&rsquo;s Arseny Shurapchikov and Olga Ermolcheva of the Ukraine will each receive individualized poker training from one of the participating Team PokerStars Pros as they prepare for their free-entry WCOOP events this month.

The four have been entered into freezeout WCOOP Events #1, #22 and #66 (a package worth over $5,500) and will be competing in a unique leaderboard format with the winner coming away with a 2015 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure package. The package up for grabs includes the buy-in to the PCA Main Event in the Bahamas as well as one week of lodging and food expenses for the winner.

European Poker Tour host Joe Stapleton will host a Google Hangout with the four Prot&eacute;g&eacute;s on Friday, September 5&mdash;two days before the virtual cards go in the air for the WCOOP kickoff event.

PokerStars could be gauging the initial response from the inaugural Prot&eacute;g&eacute;s Contest to plan future promotional events along the same lines.

The site&rsquo;s blog readers are encouraged to &ldquo;stay tuned&rdquo; for additional information on how to participate in a $1,000 Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Freeroll, which could mean that more events of this nature are planned in the future.
