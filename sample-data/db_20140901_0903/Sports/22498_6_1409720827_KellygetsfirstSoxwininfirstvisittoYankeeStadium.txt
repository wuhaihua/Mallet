Kelly gets first Sox win in first visit to Yankee Stadium Kelly gets first Sox win in first visit to Yankee Stadium September 3, 2014, 12:00 am NEW YORK -- Tuesday night marked a couple of firsts for Red Sox  starter Joe Kelly.
It was his first visit to Yankee Stadium, and his first win as a member of the Red Sox.
Kelly pitched 6 2/3 innings and allowed three runs on five hits with four walks and six strikeouts and picked up the victory in a 9-4 Red Sox win over the Yankees.
"This is the first time I've been here,'' said Kelly, who noted he was on the DL when his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals, visited the Bronx earlier this season.
"It's definitely an awesome stadium, an awesome venue. Walking out to the bullpen, I kind of had to look around and take it all in because it was my first time. I didn't want to let (the atmosphere) get to me; I just wanted to be able to know, remember how it felt, pitching here for the first time.''
And it helped that after six starts -- one loss and five no-decisions - to pick up a win to call his own.
It helped that the Sox provided early support. They got two runs in the top of the first and four more in the third.
"It's always great to get runs like that,'' said Kelly. "It was fun watching from the bench today, watching what those guys did with the bats.
It was incredible -- big hits, big homers. It was definitely fun and when you have a lead like that, you want to attack their hitters and get your guys back in (the dugout) if they're going hot like that.''
Kelly did that through the first four innings, allowing just one baserunner -- a leadoff homer by Martin Prado in the third. But in the fifth, he allowed a leadoff single to Carlos Beltran and suddenly had difficulty pitching out of the stretch.
He walked in one run and allowed another on an infield single to Derek Jeter before getting out of the jam by fanning Brett Gardner on a called third strike.
"I just started to feel myself rushing out there,'' he said, "jumping off the mound a little bit. I was getting really, really frustrated with myself. I got the bases loaded and walked one guy in and I was like, 'Forget it, I'll just go from the windup, which I felt comfortable with. It's something I'll have to work with in my next bullpen, just to be able to find that timing and release point coming from the stretch and being confident with it.''
A positive was that Kelly, who had his start two turns ago curtailed by some shoulder discomfort and acknowledged he was mindful of it in his last outing, didn't deal with that issue at all Tuesday.
"I didn't even think about it at all today, which was awesome,'' Kelly said. "It was a definitely a plus going into the game -- no worries, no care and just going out there and focusing on the hitter and making pitches.''
