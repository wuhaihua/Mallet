			Shotgun Paddy's first major aim of the new National Hunt season will be the Coral Welsh National at Chepstow over the festive period.The Emma Lavelle-trained seven-year-old won the Classic Chase at Warwick last season and went down only narrowly in the four-mile National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham.It is well publicised the gelding needs soft ground as his optimum and the Chepstow contest seems an obvious target.Dan Downie, racing manager for owners Axom Racing, said: "Shotgun Paddy may have one run over hurdles to get him under way."His aim in the first half of the season will be the Welsh National. Everybody knows he must have soft or heavy ground too be seen at his best and he stays all day, so it looks the right race for him."Axom's members have some exciting prospects to look forward to this season, including Irving, who was sent off 7-2 joint-favourite for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle but could only finish ninth behind Vautour."Irving will probably start back in the Elite Hurdle at Wincanton," said Downie."There's a race at Kempton that he could go for if he's ready in time, but we're favouring the Elite at the moment."We've also got Far West and Vibrato Valtat going novice chasing this season, so it's a really exciting time."
