                    KANSAS CITY, Mo. &mdash; Pitcher Brandon Finnegan, who was the Kansas City Royals&#39; first-round pick in the June draft out of TCU, will be among the September call-ups, the club said Sunday.

The previous two Royals players to make their major league debut the same year they were drafted were Bo Jackson in 1986 and Jeff Granger in 1993.



No player drafted this June has played in the majors so far this season.

Finnegan has a 1.33 ERA, allowing four earned runs in 27 innings in 13 appearances with Double-A Northwest Arkansas and Class A Wilmington. He has struck out 26 and walked four.

The Royals also will call up outfielders Terrance Gore, who has 47 stolen bases in 54 attempts with two minor-league clubs, and Lane Adams, who hit .269 with Northwest Arkansas.
