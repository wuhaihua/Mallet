			Karl Burke is thinking of giving Odeliz one more run before she heads to Canada for her long-term objective, the Grade One EP Taylor Stakes at Woodbine on October 19.The Denny Cordell Lavarack & Lanwades Stud Fillies Stakes at Gowran on September 21 could be the race that fits in nicely into Burke's plans for the filly who has finished in the first four in her last four Group races.Her latest creditable effort came in the Atalanta Stakes at Sandown on Saturday when she only found the classy French filly Fintry too good."We probably feel we didn't get the run of the race. We were boxed in on the rail further back than ideal. If we could have latched onto the French filly we would have given her a race, but that's racing. Our filly and the French filly are very good," said the Middleham handler."She's come out of the race perfect, no problems at all."The long-term plan has always been the EP Taylor in Canada. There's no change in that. It's just a question of if we give her one more run and that could possibly be the Lanwades Stud Stakes over nine furlongs."That would still give us three weeks to Canada, so that looks the ideal slot for her."
