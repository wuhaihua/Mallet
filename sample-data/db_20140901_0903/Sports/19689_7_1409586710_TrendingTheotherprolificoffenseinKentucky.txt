                    Each week, SN college football writer Bill Bender will look at the must-know statistical trends across the nation.&nbsp;

Kentucky and prolific offense often aren&#39;t in the same sentence, unless one is talking about John Calipari&#39;s latest recruiting class. &nbsp;
Let&#39;s talk football. Kentucky led the nation with an average of 13.1 yards per play in Week 1, a 59-14 win against Tennessee-Martin.&nbsp;

The Wildcats were one of four schools that  in Week 1. That elite group:&nbsp;

Kentucky: 656 yards, 13.1 yards per play
Oregon: 673 yards, 10.7 ypp. &nbsp;
Arizona: 787 yards, 10.6 ypp.&nbsp;
Nebraska: 784 yards, 10.6 ypp.&nbsp;

Those other offenses are known for piling on the statistics, and at least for a week, Kentucky is in that conversation. Quarterback Patrick Towles totaled 407 yards, and Nebraska transfer Braylon Heard had two carries for 116 yards and two TDs.&nbsp;

We&#39;ll find out if second-year coach Mark Stoops&#39; offense is for real soon enough. The Wildcats host Ohio on Sept. 6 before a trip to &ldquo;The Swamp&rdquo; to visit Florida on Sept. 13.&nbsp;
