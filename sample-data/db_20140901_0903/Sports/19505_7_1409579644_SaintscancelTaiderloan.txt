			Southampton have cancelled Saphir Taider's loan from Inter Milan and questioned the midfielder's commitment.The 22-year-old arrived in the summer as part of the deal which sent Dani Osvaldo on loan to the Italian club but departs without making a senior appearance.Osvaldo's position is unaffected by Taider's exit.A statement on the Southampton website read: "Having failed to live up to the high levels of commitment expected of Southampton players, the loan arrangement has been cut short by the club."
