                    HAMPTON, Ga. &mdash; Danica Patrick earned a career-best sixth-place finish on a night when at times it didn&rsquo;t appear she would finish on the lead lap.

Patrick fell a lap down twice Sunday in the Oral-B 500 before rallying for a sixth-place finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway, topping her career best of seventh at Kansas in May.



The Stewart-Haas Racing driver was fourth on the final restart and got shuffled back to sixth in the final two laps, costing her a chance to make history. The highest finish ever for a female driver in Cup came in 1949 when Sara Christian finished fifth in a race at Heidelberg (Pa.) Raceway in the first year of NASCAR.

&ldquo;It was a solid, solid finish,&rdquo; Patrick said. &ldquo;I was hoping for a top-five, right down there at the line with Carl (Edwards).

&ldquo;But sixth place is definitely something to be happy about, and I was hoping for a solid top-15. That was much better.&rdquo;

It was just Patrick&rsquo;s fourth top-10 in 71 career Cup starts. After staring 27th, she didn&rsquo;t appear on pace for a top-10 early in the event. She fell a lap down and got the free pass during a caution on Lap 38. She then needed another free pass to get back on the lead lap on Lap 124.

Her Stewart-Haas Racing teammate Kevin Harvick set a blistering pace early in the event.

&ldquo;When you have Kevin Harvick who is so fast, &hellip; it&rsquo;s very hard to start 27th and not be perfect &mdash; the car was definitely too tight at the beginning &mdash; and not have Kevin Harvick catch you,&rdquo; Patrick said.

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just so fast around here. We fought hard and we came back, and the second time I got lapped, I (had gotten) the lucky dog so I had to start last. Again, you&rsquo;re put in a tough spot.&rdquo;

Patrick holds the record for the top female finisher in the Indianapolis 500 (third) and the Daytona 500 (eighth).

In her rookie Cup season, she finished 27th in the standings. This year, she is 28th in the standings with 11 races left in the season.

&ldquo;Since that solid run like this at Kansas, we&rsquo;ve been so much faster and qualifying much better,&rdquo; said Patrick, who has three top-15 starts in her last six races. &ldquo;It was whether something fails or I make a mistake or there is an accident or something like that. There was just so many things that kept putting us out of contention and wrecking our weekends.

&ldquo;This weekend, we just didn&rsquo;t have that. We fought hard at the beginning and were in a good place at the end. &hellip; We&rsquo;ve all been looking for a really good weekend after what we&rsquo;ve been going through a lately.&rdquo;

Patrick said that crew chief Tony Gibson made some changes during the race that brought her car to life, changes that reverted back to a setup that Patrick felt most comfortable.

&ldquo;The car was really good,&rdquo; Patrick said. &ldquo;I had one lap where I felt like I was playing a video game out there. I was just driving around the top side of everybody.

&ldquo;It was a little more human-like after that. Gibson and everybody did a good job.&rdquo;

Atlanta often is a track where drivers with open-wheel backgrounds run well because of the high speeds and multiple grooves.

Next week at Richmond will provide a different challenge at a tough short track.

&ldquo;I am just so happy for the team,&rdquo; Patrick said. &ldquo;We have had pretty fast cars for quite a while now and not really great finishes for it. &hellip;&nbsp;I have sucked at Richmond every time, so I sure hope I can run well at Richmond now.&rdquo;
