Mandatory Credit: Jaime Valdez-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The first AP Poll of the season has been released, well the first one since anyone has played actual games.&nbsp; Considering the preseason polls are little more than a best guess as to how teams will perform, it takes a few weeks for the polls to take shape.&nbsp; The Oregon Ducks however, caught the attention of the AP writers.  After a 62-13 trouncing of FCS South Dakota, the Oregon Ducks found themselves looking at the second week of the AP Poll with a smile on their face.&nbsp; Sure the Ducks still sit third behind Florida State and Alabama, but the Oregon Ducks captured the second most first place votes after their victory. Florida State sits number one overall having grabbed 46 of the first place votes.&nbsp; While the Crimson Tide is ahead of the Ducks in the poll, Alabama only secured 1 first place vote after looking sluggish against a medicore West Virginia squad. The Ducks welcome Michigan State to Autzen this weekend for the College Gameday Game of the Week.&nbsp; Despite the cupcake opponent in week 1, the Oregon Ducks are looking to turn heads early on in 2014.&nbsp; Going up against the Big Ten super power should be a great measuring stick test for both teams. With the Ducks having Nation Championship aspirations, everything could be on the line in week two.&nbsp; A loss could set them on the outside looking in when it comes to the end of season, four team playoff. Kickoff on Saturday is at 6:30 pm EST on Fox.&nbsp; Look for Marcus Mariota, Thomas Tyner, and Byron Marshall to continue the success they found in week 1 against the Spartans.
