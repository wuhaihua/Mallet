White Sox rest Jose Abreu for precautionary reasons White Sox rest Jose Abreu for precautionary reasons  MINNEAPOLIS — Jose Abreu could be in line for four days off after he wasn’t in the White Sox lineup on Tuesday night.
Coupled with no games on Monday and Thursday, the White Sox may elect to not play Abreu again on Wednesday night, manager Robin Ventura said. Ventura said Abreu isn’t injured but he’s shown signs of soreness in the past few games. Over the weekend, Abreu said he had soreness in high on his left leg near his hip.

Abreu has a .320/.381/602 slash line with 33 homers and 99 RBIs in 525 plate appearances this season.
“You see him running around, limping and things like that,” Ventura said. “Just lingering things, you hope a couple days here that could help him for the rest of the way.
“He’s not injured, but every time you look at him it looks like he might get injured. He wants to play but I think just making sure he doesn’t do anything worse. For right now, just give him a day.
“With (Monday) off and (Tuesday) hopefully that’s enough. I don’t know if he’ll want to sit (Wednesday) but we’ll see.”
