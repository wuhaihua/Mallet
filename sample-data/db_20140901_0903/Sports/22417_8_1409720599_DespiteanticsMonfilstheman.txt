Despite antics, Monfils the man Despite antics, Monfils the man 

                                        
                                        
                                    
                            
                        
                        NEW YORK --         Gael Monfils remains one of the most spectacular athletes in professional sport. The 28-year-old Frenchman is also a piece of work. An example:

We take you back to this year's French Open, three weeks after Monfils retired from his semifinals match against         Grigor Dimitrov in Bucharest, Romania, with a sprained ankle. In his first court appearance afterward, on a rain-slicked Court Philippe Chattrier, Monfils put on a gymnastics clinic. In a         Kids' Day dance-off with fellow French player         Laurent Lokoli, there were handstands, backward somersaults and some down-and-dirty steps that would have         broken both ankles of a lesser man.





     

Naturally, Monfils won his first four matches in Paris -- including one over No. 15-ranked         Fabio Fognini -- and took the first two sets off         Andy Murray in the quarterfinals. That Monfils won a total of five games in what turned out to be a five-set loss surprised no one. Like the ubiquitous box of Russell Stover candies, you never really know what you're going to get with Monfils. Tuesday, he was rolling along against Dimitrov, of all people, when he went clown-crazy. Down love-40 at 4-all in the second set, he moved up halfway between the baseline and the service box, giving Dimitrov pause. Even as he began his walk to the changeover chair,         Monfils slapped Dimitrov's serve into the back wall at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Would it shock you to learn that Monfils won his fourth-round match against the ascendant No. 7 seed 7-5, 7-6 (6), 7-5? Actually, this was a low-key match by Monfils standards. Maybe that's why he's through to his second US Open quarterfinal and sixth of his career. And, in his 11th year as a professional, he has now recorded two same-year major quarterfinals for the first time.

Monfils, the very picture of consistency, has won each and every one of the 12 sets he's played.

"It's because I love to play here," Monfils said in his on-court interview. "Such a good energy. I feel good. I'm happy, so I deliver a good game."

On the certifiably hottest day of the summer in New York (it touched 92 degrees and the humidity was brutal), Monfils schooled the 23-year-old Dimitrov with patience more than anything. He broke the Bulgarian in the 11th game of the first set and closed out at love. Then, after saving two set points in a second-set tiebreaker to get to 6-all, Monfils induced Dimitrov -- with a series of short but disarming bloop shots -- to bang two forehands long.

And so the No. 20 seed is envisioning a quarterfinal match with No. 2         Roger Federer, who was to play No. 17         Roberto Bautista Agut in the first night match.

For Dimitrov, count this Slam as disappointing. He broke through with his first career major quarterfinal at the Australian Open and followed it up with a semifinal appearance at Wimbledon.

It was a sweet win for Monfils, who is playing here without a coach. His former mentor, Roger Rasheed, happens to be Dimitrov's coach. For now, Monfils said: "I'll keep it like this."

No. 1 is done     

Catherine "CiCi" Bellis, the darling of this US Open and the No. 1 seed, is out of the junior girls' singles tournament.

The 15-year-old from San Francisco, who became the youngest player to win a main-draw match in 18 years, ran into a bigger, stronger player, Natalia Vikhlyantseva of Russia. The 2-hour, 9-minute match, played on the Grandstand, ended at 7-6 (9), 2-6, 6-1.

As the score suggests, the first-set tiebreaker was epic. Vikhlyantseva converted her sixth set point with an ace down the middle at 105 mph. The Russian's fastest serve, 114 mph, was 15 mph faster than Bellis' best offering.

Bellis and partner Marketa Vondrousova are the No. 1 seed in the girls' junior doubles event.

It's Serena's fault(s)     

Serena Williams, by broad consensus, has the greatest serve the women's game has ever seen. But Tuesday, that powerful stroke let her down.

Serving at 4-5 in the second set of a women's doubles quarterfinal, she hit consecutive double faults, and she and sister         Venus fell to No. 4 seed         Ekaterina Makarova and         Elena Vesnina 7-6 (5), 6-4.

Their Wimbledon exit was similar, as a visibly wobbly Serena hit four straight double faults. This time, however, she appeared to have her wits about her in the match that was played before a good-sized crowd on Louis Armstrong.

Serena called a medical timeout in the second set and WTA trainers treated her right ankle and re-taped it. This could be significant because Serena meets No. 11 seed         Flavia Pennetta in a quarterfinal match Wednesday. She could see Makarova again in the semifinals, if the Russian can get by         Victoria Azarenka.

Venus and Serena have won 13 Grand Slam doubles titles.

Davis Cup teams announced     

There will be some star power when the Davis Cup semifinals begin Sept. 12-14 in Paris and Switzerland, if the players announced Tuesday morning actually play.

Federer and         Stan Wawrinka are scheduled to play on a hard court in Geneva against an Italian team that features Fognini. Meanwhile, on the clay at Roland Garros, the French team of         Jo-Wilfried Tsonga,         Richard Gasquet and Monfils takes on the Czech Republic, which is led by         Tomas Berdych.

Federer, Wawrinka and Monfils were still alive in the US Open at the time of the announcement.
