Marshawn Lynch speaks ... no, really Marshawn Lynch speaks ... no, really 
                
                
           
                    RENTON, Wash.&nbsp;&mdash; Marshawn Lynch only stared when asked about his contract situation. His football-related answers were brief at best.

The only time the Seattle Seahawks running back gave an expanded response was when he was speaking about his foundation.

Lynch spoke with the media for the first time since the Super Bowl after Tuesday&#39;s practice and his answers were shorter than his infamous three availabilities during Super Bowl week.

He did not answer any questions regarding his contract situation or the reasons behind his holdout from the first week of training camp. Lynch reported for camp after his deal was slightly restructured to include more guaranteed money for the 2014 season.

He said his goal for this season was &quot;to have fun.&quot; Asked if he can see Seattle&#39;s offense changing this season with Percy Harvin being healthy along with the desire to get running backs Robert Turbin and Christine Michael a bit more involved, Lynch said, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll find out.&quot;

Lynch has been the workhorse for Seattle&#39;s offense since his arrival via trade during the 2010 season. Lynch has 1,066 carries for 4,624 yards and 41 touchdowns in the regular season since joining the Seahawks.

Lynch&#39;s dealings with the media have been rare. He started talking during last season&#39;s playoffs only because he was facing the potential of a large fine from the NFL. During Super Bowl week, Lynch took part in the mandatory three media availabilities but spoke for less than eight minutes during each of the three days.

He intends on fulfilling the obligations this season.

&quot;I&#39;m going to do what I&#39;m doing now boss,&quot; Lynch said.

Lynch opened up when talking about his foundation that helps children and families in his hometown of Oakland, California. Lynch has put on various fundraisers and regularly hosted football camps for inner-city children.

&quot;Because even if I wasn&#39;t in the position I&#39;m in now, I would have tried to get into something like what I&#39;m doing with my foundation,&quot; Lynch said.
