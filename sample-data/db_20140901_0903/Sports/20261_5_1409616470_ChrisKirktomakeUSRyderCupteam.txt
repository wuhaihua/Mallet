Chris Kirk to make U.S. Ryder Cup team? Chris Kirk to make U.S. Ryder Cup team? Joe Maiorana-USA TODAY SportsGolf    Chris Kirk undoubtedly played the biggest final two rounds of his career on Sunday and Monday at the Deutsche Bank Championship and may have played his way into the Ryder Cup. &nbsp;when. He outplayed numerous tour players including the world&rsquo;s No. 1, Rory McIlroy, leading Kirk to shooting 12-under par overall in his final two rounds and to win the second of four PGA Tour FedEx Cup Playoff events.  Tom Watson will make three captains picks for the U.S. Ryder Cup squad on Tuesday Sept. 2. Kirk was No. 14 in the U.S. Ryder Cup rankings, five spots away from an automatic bid. The nine that are on the team already are Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed and Zach Johnson. Bubble players include Kirk, Keegan Bradley and Ryan Palmer who finished at tied for 16 with 8-under par, Ryan Moore who shot 6-over for the tournament, Hunter Mahan who won last week giving him a chance at a spot, Brendon Todd who missed the cut this weekend and Webb Simpson who shot 9-under for the tournament. The possibilities are endless for Watson. Kirk looks like he has the best shot. While he finished tied for 53rd last week at The Barclays, he showed how hot he can get this weekend at the Deutsche Bank. Mahan may have won last week, but he evidenced his inconsistent play again this weekend with a 1-over finish at the Deutsche Bank. Ryan Palmer finished tied for 5th at the PGA Championship, but hasn&rsquo;t impressed since. Keegan Bradley has looked like a favorite for a captain&rsquo;s pick spot as he played in the 2012 Ryder Cup with Phil Mickelson. Bradley shot 1-under at The Barclays and 8-under par at the Deutsche Bank Championship despite missing the cut at the PGA Championship. Tom Watson undoubtedly has his hands full, but Kirk looks to be a lock for the U.S. squad. &nbsp;
