For a minor league player, versatility is often seen as the path to the majors, but         Milwaukee Brewers prospect Nathan Orf took that to a completely different level Sunday as he played all nine positions for the Class A Brevard County Manatees.

     

An infielder by trade, Orf began the game at catcher and ended it after recording an out in his first ever professional appearance as a pitcher.

In order, Orf played catcher, first base, second base, third base, shortstop, left field, center field, right field and finally pitcher.

Manatees manager Joe Ayrault took Orf out of the game after he induced a groundout to third and the crowd at Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida, gave the super-utility player a standing ovation, according to MiLB.com.

Orf went 0-for-2 with a walk and made four defensive plays at three different positions, according to MiLB.com.

Playing in their season finale, the Manatees lost 7-3 to the Dunedin Blue Jays.

While it's unusual for a player to play all nine positions in a single baseball game, it's not unprecedented.         San Francisco Giants star         Buster Posey         completed the feat while playing in college at Florida State.
