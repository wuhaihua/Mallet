								Chicquita nears return
							
						
					
				
			
			Last year's Irish Oaks winner Chicquita is on course to make her eagerly-awaited seasonal debut in the Moyglare "Jewels" Blandford Stakes at the Curragh on September 14.The filly was trained by Alain de Royer-Dupre when she landed the Curragh Classic and joined Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable after being sold for six million euros at a dispersal sale at Goffs in November.Should all go well on her comeback then she could go to Longchamp for either the Prix de l'Opera or the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe."Hopefully the plan is to start her at the Curragh in the mile and a quarter fillies race," O'Brien told At The Races."Everything has been going well so far and we will hopefully start her there and go from there, but it's so far so good with her."We will start there and then there's the Arc weekend when she has the fillies race or the Arc. I suppose we'll get her started first, see how that goes, and then a pick a race after that."
