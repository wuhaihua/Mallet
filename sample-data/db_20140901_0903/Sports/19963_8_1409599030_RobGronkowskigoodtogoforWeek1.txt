Rob Gronkowski good to go for Week 1 Rob Gronkowski good to go for Week 1 He's back.New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski said he has been cleared to play in the season opener against the Miami Dolphins Sunday."I'm ready to go," Gronkowski told reporters Monday in front of his locker. "I'll be playing."Gronkowski is nearly nine months removed from a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered Week 14 against the Cleveland Browns. He underwent reconstructive surgery Jan. 9, had been limited throughout training camp and was held out of all preseason games while he recovered."My mentality now is I'm ready to go," Gronkowski said. "I'm ready to be out there. I'm ready to hit. I'm ready to start going."After other injuries to his forearm, back and ankle restricted him to only 18 games in the past two seasons, Gronkowski is expected to play limited snaps Sunday as he returns to game shape. His addition to New England's offense, however, provides a huge boost for quarterback Tom Brady, especially in the red zone. In 60 career games together, the two have connected for 42 touchdowns.Gronkowski missed the first six games of 2013 rehabbing a forearm injury, but caught 39 passes for 592 yards and four touchdowns in seven contests before sustaining the season-ending knee injury Dec. 8.
