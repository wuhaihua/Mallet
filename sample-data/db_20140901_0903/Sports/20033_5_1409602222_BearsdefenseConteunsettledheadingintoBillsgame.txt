Bears defense, Conte unsettled heading into Bills game Bears defense, Conte unsettled heading into Bills game  The distinct feeling is that the Bears are holding the door open for Chris Conte at free safety. The issue is whether or not the veteran will be able to step through it and win back a job for which the Bears brought in myriad challengers.
Coach Marc Trestman delayed announcing any starters at safety, although Ryan Mundy has appeared to be a lock at strong safety with solid, generally mistake-free work in the deep middle. Danny McCray moved past rookie Brock Vereen early in training camp and started the first three preseason games.

But while McCray was primarily a special-teamer in his four years with Dallas, Conte played in 31 games over the past two seasons, starting all of them at free safety after winning that job for nine games in 2011 before suffering an ankle injury.
“I think we’re going to still wait and see. We’re rotating the guys around. And we’ll talk more about that on Wednesday. And we’ll get them started in the right direction. I’d just rather wait another day-and-a-half. But we’ve got four guys that we moved around and…he’s been allowed to get work. He got work today, so we have to see where he is as well going into Wednesday’s practice.”
Conte’s only playing time was in the Seattle game, during which he suffered a concussion and was only available again this week.
