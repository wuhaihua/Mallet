                    If  says he&#39;s ready to play in Week 1, then who are we to argue?&nbsp;

Gronk told reporters on Monday that he&#39;ll be good to go for the Patriots season opener in Miami, though he noted he won&#39;t play a full complement of snaps.&nbsp;

But guess what -- it doesn&#39;t matter! Even a half-game Gronk is better than a full-game other TE (except&nbsp;and&nbsp;), so for the owners who took the plunge on Gronkowski on draft day, your gamble has paid off, at least for one week.

The only worry is that Gronkowski is rushing back too fast and will aggravate his injury, but obviously there&#39;s nothing we can do about that. All we know is that Gronk will be on the field,&nbsp;&nbsp;and that&#39;s all we need to know to start him. It&#39;s an added bonus that the Dolphins allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to TEs last year.



participated in non-contact individual&nbsp;drills during practice on Monday, and it&#39;s believed that if he has no symptoms and passes his baseline tests throughout the week, he&#39;ll suit up&nbsp;for the Broncos&#39; season opener against Indianapolis.

Like Gronkowski, Welker is another guy you should start as long as he&#39;s active. Obviously, there are concerns that another big hit could knock him out for the rest of the game, but that&#39;s true for every player. Worries about Welker are more long-term, so, if anything, Welker owners should hope he plays and has a good game. Then, they should try to trade him.

If Welker doesn&#39;t suit up in Week 1, look for&nbsp;to get more snaps and be a major sleeper.
