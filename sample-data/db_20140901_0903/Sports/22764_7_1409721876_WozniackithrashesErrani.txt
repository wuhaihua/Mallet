			Caroline Wozniacki reached her first grand slam semi-final since the 2011 US Open with a comprehensive rout of Sara Errani at Flushing Meadows.No 10 seed Wozniacki, who reached the final in 2009, needed only 65 minutes to beat Errani 6-0 6-1.Errani, the 13th seed, was unable to hold her serve throughout the match as Wozniacki dominated from the baseline.Wozniacki will now face Peng Shuai, a player who she has beaten five times in six meetings, for a place in the final."It was really tricky conditions with the wind but I tried to stay aggressive," Wozniacki said."You always go out there and are a little bit nervous. I served really well after that."Wozniacki has endured a mixed year in which she has struggled for consistency - however in New YorkÂ she has shown the sort of form that took her to the top of the world rankings."It means so much to me," said Wozniacki."It's been a pretty up and down year for me, and to be here in the semi-finals of the US Open again is just incredible."
