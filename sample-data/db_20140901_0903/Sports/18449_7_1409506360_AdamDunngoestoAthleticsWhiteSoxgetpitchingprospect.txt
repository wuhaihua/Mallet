                    Adam Dunn will get another chance to play for a postseason contender, thanks to Sunday&#39;s trade that sent him to the Oakland Athletics.

Sunday is the final day for teams to acquire players and have them eligible for postseason play.

Dunn, 34, takes his power potential to a team pushing for a division title with dreams of the World Series. In the deal, the A&#39;s sent right-handed pitcher Nolan Sanburn to the Chicago White Sox. The Sox also sent cash considerations to the A&#39;s, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

No hitter for average, Dunn has 20 homers and 54 RBIs in 106 games. He is limited in use to a designated hitter role but also can be used at first base and, in a pinch, as a corner outfielder. His batting average is .220, worst than his .237 career average, and is vulnerable to strikeouts.

It&#39;s power the A&#39;s need. They traded their best power hitter to the Boston Red Sox in acquiring left-handed starter Jon Lester for outfielder Yoenis Cespedes a month ago.

Sanburn is 3-1 as a Class A reliever. He is in his third pro season after being a second-round pick in the 2012 MLB draft. He averaged a strikeout per inning through 72 appearances this season.

Dunn had to OK the deal because of his no-trade clause. The San Francisco Giants also had interest in Dunn, according to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports.
