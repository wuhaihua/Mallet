With the additions of Maryland and Rutgers this season, they have no expanded to 14 teams, with fan bases throughout all parts of the northeast and midwest regions.  As the games were going on over the weekend with games involving teams from the conference, there was a commercial that was consistently shown, letting everyone see just how much the conference has expanded its reach throughout certain parts of the country. Well of course, they also set the commercial to different themes, and one of them that was used was that of the highly popular HBO series, &lsquo;Game of Thrones.&rsquo; In case you did not know, this makes since given the fact that the author of the book series, George RR Martin, is a Northwestern alum. The commercial is pretty well done, and you can view it in the video below.
