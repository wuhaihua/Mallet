			Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo has signed for Spanish side Valencia on an initial one-year loan deal, with a view to make the move permanent next summer.Negredo scored 23 goals in his first season in England following his move from Sevilla, but the last of those came in January, with his form suffering a severe downturn.The emergence of Stevan Jovetic has moved Negredo further down the pecking order at City, and despite stating his desire to keep the former Sevilla hit-man, City boss Manuel Pellegrini has allowed Negredo to return to his homeland.Negredo follows Micah Richards out of the door at City, after the England defender joined Serie A side Fiorentina on loan until the end of the season.La Liga side Valencia have an obligation to purchase the Spain international at the end of the loan period.
