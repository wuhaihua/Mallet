								Mauresmo: Pressure on Novak
							
						
					
				
			
			Amelie Mauresmo says all the pressure will be on Novak Djokovic in Wednesday night’s highly-anticipated showdown with Andy Murray at the US Open.The pair go head-to-head in New York in the quarter-finals, the first time Murray has taken on one of his big-four rivals since hiring Mauresmo as his coach ahead of Wimbledon.The long-time rivals headline the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium in what is their first clash ina grand slam since last year's Wimbledon final.The Scot goes into the match having chalked up his first victory over a top-10 player since last year’s Wimbledon, beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round.And Mauresmo was hugely encouraged by that straight-sets victory ahead of what promises to be a much tougher battle against the world No 1.She said: "For me the most important thing is how he played (against Tsonga). I think it's the best match I've seen him play since I came into the team."He should be satisfied about it. The level is going up towards the second week of the tournament. He definitely has to now look forward to the next one.Pressure"I think he should really go out there and express fully what he's capable of doing. The pressure is probably a little bit more on Novak, which is normal, he won Wimbledon."Even if he didn't have a great summer, he showed from the beginning here that he's ready for these big ones. I think it's definitely one to embrace."Murray did a good job of staying positive throughout the match against Tsonga, recovering quickly from lapses at the start of the second and third sets.There was still plenty of shouting and swearing, some in the direction of Mauresmo and the rest of his team.The former world number one was coy about whether she will try to curb Murray's on-court behaviour, as predecessor Ivan Lendl did to a certain extent, but revealed the two have discussed it."I think it's his way of dealing with things," she said. "He knows himself pretty well now and I think he knows how to handle himself on the court. We're talking about it sometimes but it's not a big deal."Watch all the action from the US Open live on Sky Sports 3, with coverage from 4pm.
