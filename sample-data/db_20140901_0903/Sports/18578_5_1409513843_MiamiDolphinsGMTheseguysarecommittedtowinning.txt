Mandatory Credit: Kevin Hoffman-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Miami Dolphins were just one win away from making the playoffs last year even though they were not a great team by any stretch. The Dolphins ultimately faltered in the end of the season, losing two games in a row that ousted them from the playoffs.  Considering that the team boasted the worst offensive line in the league, allowing 58 sacks on Ryan Tannehill, it was impressive that they were in the running for the playoffs at all. Compounding the Dolphins problems was the media circus surrounding the Jonathan Martin and Richie Incognito bullying scandal. Ultimately the Dolphins rid themselves of both players, and are looking to move past the hoopla and have a successful season this year. Ryan Tannehill is coming into his third season with the team, and will look to bring them to the playoffs for the first time in five seasons. With a revamped receiving corps and offensive line, the Dolphins seemed poised to shock the NFL and potentially win the AFC East this season. Miami Dolphins general manager Dennis Hickey spoke with the media today, and he has high expectations for this upcoming season. Hickey on his team: &ldquo;These guys are committed to winning. They&rsquo;re passionate. They&rsquo;re excited to take the field.&rdquo; &mdash; Adam Beasley (@AdamHBeasley) August 31, 2014 The Dolphins were 8-8 last year and finished 3rd in the AFC East behind the Jets and Patriots. Considering that the Bills and Jets brought in a ton of new talent this offseason as well, the AFC East may become one of the most competitive divisions in the league.
