                    Hitting a walkoff homerun probably feels pretty sweet, but what about calling the homer seconds before it happens on live TV?

That&#39;s exactly what MLB Network&#39;s Greg Amsinger did during the Giants and Rockies game on August 27. The two teams were knotted up at 2-2 in the ninth inning when Buster Posey stepped up to the plate for the Giants.&nbsp;Amsinger jokingly said he had &quot;that feeling in my bad knee&quot; and suggested Posey might go yard right before it happened.



Even better than calling the shot is Amsinger&#39;s reaction once they cut back to the studio. The analyst seemed more surprised than anyone.

To answer Amsinger&#39;s question, &quot;how hot was that?&quot; Pretty hot, G-money, pretty hot.
