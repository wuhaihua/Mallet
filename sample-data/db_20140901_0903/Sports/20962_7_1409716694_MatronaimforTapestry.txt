			Aidan O'Brien has two good reasons to give Tapestry her next start in the Coolmore Fastnet Rock Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on September 13.Ireland's champion trainer wants to run her on home soil and over a shorter trip following her shock victory over Taghrooda in the mile and a half Yorkshire Oaks."We probably wouldn't like to travel her again for her next start, so it is very possible she'll stay at home and it's very possible she'll run in the Matron (over a mile)," O'Brien told At The Races."We'd maybe rather stay at home and not go a mile and a half. She can step up in trip again after that."She'll obviously have an option Arc weekend after that or she'll have an option to miss that and go to America, so there's a big chance she'll stay home and go for the Matron."
