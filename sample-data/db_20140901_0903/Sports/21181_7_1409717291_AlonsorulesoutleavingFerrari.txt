			Fernando Alonso has ruled out leaving Ferrari despite another year of frustration with the Scuderia and the flattery of McLaren making their interest in re-signing him public.The Spaniard, a two-time title winner with Renault prior to a tumultuous single year at McLaren alongside Lewis Hamilton, is still widely regarded as the best driver in F1 but has cut an increasingly frustrated figure this year with Ferrari unable to keep pace with runaway championship leaders Mercedes after four successive seasons of playing second fiddle to Red Bull.But after committing the second-half of his F1 career to Ferrari, the 33-year-old Alonso is not for turning."It's not my intention at the moment to move, I want to win here and finish the job that we start some years ago," Alonso told Sky Sports News HQ’s Rachel Brookes in an exclusive interview ahead of this weekend’s Italian GP.“There has been a lot of talk since last summer but from my mouth there never came any interest to leave Ferrari or any words saying l would join another team. There was a lot of speculation, which is not disturbing but it created a little bit of tension and stress. Yet you also feel happy and proud that the best teams have an interest in you,” he added.Marco Mattiacci, who replaced the ousted Stefano Domenicali as Ferrari Team Principal in April following their dismal start to F1’s new turbo era, announced last week that both Kimi Raikkonen, who has endured a torrid season in the ill-handling F14 T, and Alonso would be retained for 2015. According to the team, Alonso is under contract until 2016, although paddock gossipers have speculated that his deal contains a release clause directly related to the team’s position in the Constructors’ Championship – third at present, but just ten points ahead of Williams.Alonso’s renewal of vows with Ferrari is likely to be good news for Jenson Button, with the Englishman kept in limbo while McLaren pursued the possibility of luring Alonso back to Woking.Sky Sports News HQ's exclusive interview with Fernando Alonso will be played in full from 10am with the Spaniard discussing his future, the arrival of Marco Mattiacci as his new boss, and Lewis Hamilton's title fight with Nico Rosberg
