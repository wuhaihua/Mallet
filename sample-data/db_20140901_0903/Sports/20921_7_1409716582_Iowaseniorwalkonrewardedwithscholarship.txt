                    Four summers ago, Kyle Denning was a freshman&nbsp;walk-on, helping out Iowa&#39;s scout team during practices.

It&#39;s not an easy job, by any means, to learn an opposing team&#39;s offensive schemes and run them a few minutes later, but it&#39;s even harder to repeat that process&nbsp;every three days throughout a seven-month-long season.

Denning&#39;s hard work has not gone unnoticed, though.&nbsp;This winter,&nbsp;he&#39;ll be a scholarship player for the Hawkeyes.

Head coach Fran McCaffery announced earlier this week that he would be rewarding the senior&#39;s hard work and dedication with a scholarship for his final season. The news came as a surprise to Denning, who had hoped it might happen someday.

&quot;I&#39;ve always had it in the back of my mind that I could maybe work toward a scholarship,&quot; said Denning. &quot;It has always been a goal of mine to get a scholarship, and I&#39;m extremely thankful to have earned one my senior year.&quot;

&quot;I was thrilled,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s a big relief for my parents because it helps them out financially. My mom cried when I told her.&quot;

Roster flexibility allowed McCaffery to extend the offer to Denning, but there were a few other factors that weighed more heavily on the coach&#39;s decision.

&quot;What we like to do is if a player is a solid citizen and an excellent student, we like to reward them with a scholarship, if we have one available,&quot; McCaffery said. &quot;In this particular case, and last year with&nbsp;Darius Stokes, they both earned it.&quot;

Denning, who is expected to graduate in May, hopes to make the best of his scholarship offer this season, and wants to become a coach after he leaves Iowa.
