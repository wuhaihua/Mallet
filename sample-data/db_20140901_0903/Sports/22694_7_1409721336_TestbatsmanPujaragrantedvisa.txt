			Derbyshire have confirmed that Cheteshwar Pujara has been granted a visa.The 26-year-old India batsman will arrive in the UK ahead of next week's County Championship match with Glamorgan.Derbyshire chief executive Simon Storey said: "We knew the deadlines were tight but – because it's such a key signing for the club – we have worked hard to make it happen."As well as giving the team a boost going into the final games of the season, Pujara's signing is also an important part of our strategy to build on the work of our India Club and engage with a new generation of Derbyshire cricket fans here in the city."It's been a pretty tense period as we waited for visa approval and we're really grateful to Chris Williamson MP who has been helping us track progress on the visa and giving us confidence that we were on course for a timely completion."Pujara, who boasts a Test average of just over 49 and a first-class average of just below 59, will play for Derbyshire in their final three county fixtures of the season.
