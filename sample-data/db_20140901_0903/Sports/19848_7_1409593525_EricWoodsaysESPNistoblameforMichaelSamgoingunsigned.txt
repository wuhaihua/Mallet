                    Michael Sam, the first active openly gay player in the NFL, hasn&#39;t been picked up for a practice squad because of ESPN. Or at least that&#39;s what Buffalo Bills&nbsp;center Eric Wood tweeted on Sunday.

Wood suggested lack of interest in Sam stems from the media distraction caused by ESPN.


@RossTuckerNFL blame that on espn. No one wants the distraction

Sam was cut from the St. Louis Rams on Saturday, and after no one claimed him off waivers it seemed inevitable he would land on a practice squad. However, Sam still remains a free agent despite outperforming expectations during preseason play.

ESPN has been following Sam closely since he&nbsp;opened up about his sexuality. Taking into consideration the bizarre reports&nbsp;on&nbsp;Michael Sam&#39;s shower habits, it&#39;s not surprising some players find the media frenzy distracting.

Sam has been taking it all in stride since finding out he did not make the Rams&#39; 53-man roster:


The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I&#39;ve always known. The journey continues.
