                    Golf and college basketball rarely overlap, save for the occasional charity golf tournament, but Tom Izzo made sure the worlds collided last week when&nbsp;Lance Bennett, Matt Kuchar&#39;s caddie on the PGA Tour, lost his wife unexpectedly.&nbsp;

When word began spreading about Bennett&#39;s loss, someone made mention that he was a Michigan State fan. That was all the convincing Izzo needed. He went on a mission to track down Bennett&#39;s phone number to send his condolences.

It took Izzo about a day to finally get in contact with Bennett. After dialing the number, his first call went to voicemail. Bennett answered the second call even though he didn&#39;t recognize the number.&nbsp;

The two men ended up talking for about 15 minutes, but Izzo&#39;s kind gesture is likely one that Bennett will never forget.
