3 & Out: Practice squad, long snapper, and linebackers 3 & Out: Practice squad, long snapper, and linebackers September 2, 2014, 6:30 am In this week's edition of '3 and Out,' Patriots Insider Tom E. Curran focused on some roster moves headed into the regular season.
1) Patriots sign Boyce and Bequette to practice squad: "Even though they haven't done what we anticipated them to do," said Curran. "they say, at least they know what they're doing if we have to pop them out there. But I can't imagine that they are happy with either buy being passed, Boyce by Kenbrell Thompkins and most likely Brian Tyms and Bequette by Michael Buchanan among others."
2) Patriots sign long snapper Charley Hughlett: "This young man is ready to snap," said Curran. "but they're going to have to make a move because he's on the practice squad. Somebody will have to come off the active roster. That can be done as late as Saturday night when the team is down in Miami."
3) Patriots appear to be thin at linebacker: "If you're going to go against a run-heavy team, you have guys like Ja'Gared Davis and Deontae Skinner on the practice squad to pull up if you need to put down a safety, release him and sign him back to the practice squad.  That's how the operation will work."
