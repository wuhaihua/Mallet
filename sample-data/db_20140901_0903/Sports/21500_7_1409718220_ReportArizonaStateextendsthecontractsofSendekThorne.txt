                    TEMPE, Ariz. &mdash; Arizona State has agreed to contract extensions for men&#39;s basketball coach Herb Sendek and women&#39;s coach Charli Turner Thorne, a person familiar with the deals told The Associated Press.

The person spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because the deals have not been announced.



Sendek&#39;s extension would run through the 2018-19 season. His current contract goes through 2016, with an annual salary of $1.2 million.

Turner Thorne&#39;s extension would go through 2017-18. She is currently under contract through 2014-15.

Both deals will need to be approved by the Arizona Board of Regents.

Sendek, 51, led the Sun Devils to a 21-12 record last season and back into the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2009. He is 141-121 in eight seasons and was the Pac-10 coach of the year in 2009-10.

Turner Thorne has coached Arizona State for 17 seasons and is the school&#39;s career leader in victories with 325, second-most in Pac-12 history. She took a leave of absence for the 2011-12 season and, after a down year in 2012-13, led the Sun Devils to a 23-10 record and into the second round of the NCAA tournament last season.
