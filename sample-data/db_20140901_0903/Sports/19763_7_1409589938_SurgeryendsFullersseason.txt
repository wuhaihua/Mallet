			Gloucestershire bowler James Fuller is out for the rest of the season as he needs surgery to correct a foot problem.Seamer Fuller has been out since the end of May, and was undergoing treatment all summer for a stress reaction, but he aggravated the problem when playing in a recent Second XI match.He took 18 wickets in six LV= County Championship games before going down with the injury.Director of cricket John Bracewell said: “We needed to test it out to see if it was getting better so we could make a decision on whether an operation was necessary.“We will now get that done and dusted so that James has the winter to recover and will hopefully be fully fit by the beginning of next season.“It was particularly unfortunate because he was showing every indication of having a good season.“While the injury is termed a stress reaction, it might as well have been a stress fracture because the symptoms are so similar and the recovery period just as long.”
