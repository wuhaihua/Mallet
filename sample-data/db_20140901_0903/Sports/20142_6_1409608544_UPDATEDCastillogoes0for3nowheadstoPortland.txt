ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Phase one of the indoctrination for Rusney Castillo is complete. What happens next -- and where -- is uncertain.
Castillo went 0-for-3 with a walk in four plate appearances for the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, who defeated the GCL Yankees 8-1 on Monday and won the Gulf Coast League championship in a best-of-three series.
The Sox will now get Castillo additional minor league at-bats with Double-A Portland, which begins a first-round Eastern League playoff series in Binghamton, N.Y., on Wednesday and Thursday. The series will shift to Hadlock Field Friday, and if necessary, Saturday and Sunday.
The Red Sox could have minimized Castillo's travel responsibilities by first assigning him to Triple-A Pawtucket, which will host International League playoff games on Wednesday and Thursday, and then sending him to Portland for the weekend. But they chose to have him report directly to the Sea Dogs in Binghamton.
In Monday's game, Castillo played center field for the first time since signing with the Red Sox, having served as the DH in his debut Sunday.
However, despite playing five innings, he didn't record a chance in the outfield as nothing was hit to him.  UPDATED WITH CASTILLO'S NEXT ASSIGNMENT: 5:30 p.m.
