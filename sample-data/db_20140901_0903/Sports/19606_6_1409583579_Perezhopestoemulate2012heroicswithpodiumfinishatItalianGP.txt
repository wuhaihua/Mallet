		Force India driver Sergio Perez is hoping to emulate the performance he delivered at the 2012 Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix when he achieved a podium at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza here.
The Mexican driver finished second two years ago and said he will try to do the same at this weekend's Italian GP.

"We will certainly try. It's going to be a good track for us. It's important to qualify in the top-10 to have a chance of scoring good points. It's difficult to overtake here and if you are out of position it's hard to recover," said Perez.
"The race is another favourite of mine. Everybody enjoys coming here because it's such a beautiful location. I raced here a few times before Formula 1 and always had good results. I was on the podium two years ago -- it was one of my best races in Formula 1 and a very special memory."
The 24-year-old finished eighth to bring in four points for the team in the Belgian Grand Prix Aug 24.
"We had to score points to keep in touch with the teams ahead of us in the championship so we went quite aggressive in the race -- flat out all the way. It was a nice feeling to score my first points at Spa because I love the track. Getting two cars in the points is the target for all the races to come."
