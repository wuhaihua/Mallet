		India's top singles player Somdev Devvarman's decision to concentrate on ATP tour at the expense&nbsp;of upcoming Asian Games has come under sharp criticism from&nbsp;the All India Tennis Association, which termed the player's&nbsp;move as "not correct".
"It is not a correct decision and a disappointing one.&nbsp;Somdev said the Federation did not ask for his availability&nbsp;before naming the Asian Games squad. We said that since he is&nbsp;country's number one player, he was expected to play. We said&nbsp;that at least play the team event but he was adamant," a&nbsp;peeved AITA general secretary Bharat Oza told PTI today.
"We tried our best. But what to do, what alternative is&nbsp;there," Oza sounded helpless.

Somdev, who won two gold medals at last edition of the&nbsp;Asian Games in Gunagzhou, wants to improve his ranking as he&nbsp;has slipped to 143 following a prolonged poor run.
Somdev will lead India's challenge in the Davis Cup to be&nbsp;held from September 12-14 in Bangalore and Asian Games is set&nbsp;to begin in five days time after the World Group play-off tie.
"We had discussion with Anand and Zeeshan Ali (coach) and&nbsp;felt we have a chance in team event. We can't do anything but&nbsp;the government expects the top players to play. We can't&nbsp;force, we can only request. We even informed him that we will&nbsp;be answerable to the government, which may take objection to&nbsp;it," Oza said.
Oza, the new Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association&nbsp;President, also said, they cannot think of taking any&nbsp;disciplinary action.
"Tennis is an individual game. They do not play under&nbsp;national federation. We also understand that playing on ATP&nbsp;Tour is their bread and butter. So what can we do? The only&nbsp;thing we have in hand is Davis Cup selection.
Asked if the players were still getting financial help&nbsp;from the government, Oza said for the 2010 Commonwealth Games&nbsp;they got funds but not after that.
"We present details to the government every year before&nbsp;the budget for helping players, spelling out their travel and&nbsp;coaching requirements but the tennis players have not got&nbsp;anything after 2010 Games," Oza said.
AITA also said that reserve player Divij Sharan will&nbsp;replace Somdev in the squad.
"Divij can play in the mixed doubles. It will be good for&nbsp;him. Sometime back, he was in top-100, we want to give him&nbsp;recognition, that is why we had selected him."
Asked if it would have been better to select a singles&nbsp;player in place of Somdev, Oza said Yuki Bhambri, Saketh&nbsp;Myneni and Sanam Singh are all good enough to handle singles.
