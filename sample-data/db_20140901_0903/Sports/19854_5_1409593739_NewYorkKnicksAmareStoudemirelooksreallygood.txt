New York Knicks' Amare Stoudemire looks 'really good' New York Knicks' Amare Stoudemire looks 'really good' Apr 15, 2014; Brooklyn, NY, USA; New York Knicks forward Amare StoudemireNBA    It appears good news just keeps rolling in for the New York Knicks. The team cleared salary with the Wayne Ellington trade, they&rsquo;ve potentially picked up the steal of the NBA Draft&rsquo;s second round in Cleanthony Early and they retained a much svelter Carmelo Anthony who signed a long-term extension with the franchise this offseason.  He isn&rsquo;t the only member of the New York Knicks franchise who will report to training camp in tip-top condition though as power forward Amare Stoudemire is said to look &lsquo;really good&rsquo;. A bust ever since Stoudemire signed his mega-contract with the Knicks, Amare has struggled with injury though appeared to show flashes of greatness during stretches last season. It was a welcome sight, not only for Stoudemire himself but for the Knicks as well. Of course, now in a contract year, Amare Stoudemire&rsquo;s tenure with the organization could be coming to a close in the near future though Steve Kyler of Basketball Insiders says the former All-Star looks &lsquo;really good&rsquo; and is in fine shape.

No matter how you slice it, a healthy and fit Amare Stoudemire is good news for the New York Knicks.
