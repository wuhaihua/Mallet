Hamilton vows not to give up until it's impossible Hamilton vows not to give up until it's impossible 
Lewis Hamilton has vowed not to give up on his championship ambitions this season until it is mathematically impossible for him to win the title.
The Briton has suffered a run of bad luck recently with brake failures, engine fires and team-mate clashes meaning he's scored just 30 points out of a possible 75 over the last three races.
Team-mate Nico Rosberg however has scored 55, extending the gap between the two to 29, a deficit Hamilton is hoping to claw back starting this weekend in Italy.
"My aim for the weekend, of course, is to claw back the gap in the Drivers' Championship," said Hamilton.
"It's as big as it's been all season so I've got a lot of work ahead &ndash; but anything can happen in this sport. I won't give up until the flag drops in Abu Dhabi and there's plenty of points [200 to be precise] to be won before, so it's far from over yet."
It won't be easy for Hamilton though as Rosberg has a similar goal and of course has the advantage of a race win and more in terms of points.
"It's still all to play for in the championship and with double points in Abu Dhabi anything can happen," said the German.
"I'm focused on taking the maximum points possible in the remaining seven races and I know the team is too."
