Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY SportsNFL   Greg Robinson of the St. Louis Rams has gone from second overall pick to second string. According to Jim Thomas of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, via Twitter, Robinson is No. 2 on the depth chart at both guard position> Davin Joseph listed as starter at RG. Robinson, the No. 2 overall draft pick in May, is listed second-team behind LG Saffold and LT J. Long. &mdash; Jim Thomas (@jthom1) September 2, 2014 Rodger Saffold is set to start at left guard and Davin Joseph is at the top of the depth chart on the right side.  Robinson, the former standout tackle at Auburn, was taken second overall in May&rsquo;s draft, but the Rams moved him inside. Joseph signed in May and allows the Rams to take it more slowly with Robinson, who is having a bit of a difficult transition from Auburn&rsquo;s spread no-huddle attack to the more complicated protection schemes at the NFL level. The 21-year-old was a first-team All-SEC pick last season for Auburn, which advanced to the final BCS National Championship game. He opted to leave Auburn after his sophomore season. He redshirted in 2011, started 11 games at left tackle in 2012 and played all 14 games at the position> At 6-foot-5 and 332 pounds, Robinson came to Auburn as one of the top guard prospects in the country before being moved to the edge of the offensive line while in college. Robinson is the highest-drafted Auburn offensive lineman ever, moving ahead of Ken Rice, who was taken eighth overall by the St. Louis Cardinals.
