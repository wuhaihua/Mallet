"After a long and wonderful career I have decided to retire," Waters said in a statement. "I want to thank the coaches, players and fans of the three great organizations that I had the pleasure of working for. First the Dallas Cowboys for giving me my first and last chance of working in the NFL. I will always be grateful. Also the New England Patriots for the most successful season in my career. It was a great ride. Lastly the Kansas City Chiefs where I had pleasure of enjoying eleven wonderful seasons, which I will never forget. I want to thank the many family, friends and my hometown of Waxahachie, Texas for being great supporters. Finally I want to thank my kids for being my greatest motivations. I fought hard daily to make you proud [of] me. If the rest of my life can be half as good as the last 15 years, I will be one of the luckiest people on earth. Thankfully Brian Waters."
Waters spent 11 seasons with the Chiefs and played last season with the Cowboys. He made six Pro Bowls over the course of his career.  Former Patriots guard Brian Waters has announced his retirement from football after 13 years in the NFL.
