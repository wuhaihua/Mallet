The &ldquo;This is SportsCenter&rdquo; spots have been consistently amusing for years and that streak just continues with this new ad starring Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz (and the usual assortment of random mascots, cheerleaders and other folks). In this one, Cruz and Graham are participating in what looks like a fantasy football draft. The twist? They&rsquo;re actually drafting SportsCenter anchors. Genius. Cruz and Graham have been taken in their fair share of fantasy football drafts, and have probably gotten some grief from fans who were mad at them for not helping their FF team, so this is their chance to turn the tables. As always, the ad is cleverly conceived, marvellously executed and eminently chuckle-worthy. Solid. Bonus points for not going with the hacky goal-post dunk or salsa dance jokes. It must have been tempting to resort to the obvious but that&rsquo;s why the SportsCenter spots are the best. They never come from exactly the angle you expect. They always deliver the mildly bizarre deadpan goods. This one may not be a classic like the Rickie Fowler color blindness spot but it&rsquo;s a worthy entry in the series. Keep it up guys.
