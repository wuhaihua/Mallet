What impact can Case Keenum have on the Rams? What impact can Case Keenum have on the Rams? Aug 28, 2014; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum (7) attempts a pass during the first quarter against the San Francisco 49ers at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Case Keenum was a local favorite with the Houston Texans. He graduated from University of Houston, where he threw for over 5,000 yards and 40 touchdowns in three of his five college seasons. They Texans used Keenum when Matt Schaub&rsquo;s ego collapsed in ways similar to&nbsp;the former Vikings Stadium roof. Keenum&nbsp;produced solid statistics but couldn&rsquo;t get wins?  ESPN.com Texans&rsquo; reporter wrote, &ldquo;They are getting a quarterback who knows what he needs to do but struggles to do it.&rdquo; Keenum is all brains with the wrong instincts. The Texans&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t straighten out those instincts during his rookie season. Via ESPN.com, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have trouble reading defenses; he has trouble reacting and making the right decisions once he has.&rdquo; Keenum is quick to use his feet to avoid the rush &mdash; typical of young quarterbacks. He&rsquo;s quick to use his successful college skill set to succeed in the NFL, which doesn&rsquo;t work &mdash; also typical of young quarterbacks. It&rsquo;s a matter of coachability. Keenum needs to make a greater effort to break his bad habits. If he can&rsquo;t, he can kiss his starting aspirations goodbye. He&rsquo;ll be out of the league if he&rsquo;s committing these mistakes as a league veteran. Nick Wagoner, ESPN.com Rams reporter wrote, &ldquo;The Rams mean it when they say they are committed to&nbsp;Shaun Hill&nbsp;as the starter. I think it would take something pretty drastic in terms of his performance or an injury for that to change. That means Keenum is coming in to serve in a backup role behind Hill.&rdquo;
