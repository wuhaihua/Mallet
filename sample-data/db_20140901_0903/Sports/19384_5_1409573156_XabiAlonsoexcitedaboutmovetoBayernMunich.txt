At an introductory press conference, Alonso talked about his excitement to come and play for the Bundesliga&rsquo;s biggest team.  &ldquo;I was so excited about it all,&rdquo; Alonso said, via Sky Sports. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour and a privilege to be here in Munich. &ldquo;As soon as the clubs reached an agreement, I jumped into a plane. I was surprised I made my debut so soon, but I think it was a decent start.&rdquo; Alonso has had remarkable success throughout his career, winning the Champions League with Liverpool and Real Madrid. Bayern Munich are regular contenders for the trophy, and winning it all with a third club would be a dream for Alonso. &ldquo;That would be a dream,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a great career so far and Bayern is a new experience for me now, and it feels good. &ldquo;I like Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s style a lot and I think that I and the club can benefit greatly from him.&rdquo;
