The 49ers gave rookie running back Glenn Winston a chance, but the Cleveland Browns are giving him a job.

The Browns claimed Winston off waivers from the 49ers, according to a source close to Winston. He led the 49ers during the exhibition season with 113 yards rushing and a touchdown on 19 carries.
Winston will be joining guard Ryan Seymour, whom the Browns also claimed off waivers from the 49ers, a source confirmed. Winston and Seymour were among the 49ersâ€™ final cuts, as they reached the 53-player limit on Saturday.
Winston, who was kicked offf the Michigan State football team in 2009 after two assaults, took a long journey to the NFL. The 49ers signed him on Aug. 4 after running back Kendall Hunter's season-ending knee injury.
Seymour spent the final six games, including playoffs, on the 49ers' 53-man roster last season after he was claimed off the Seattle Seahawks' practice squad. According to a source, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh pleaded with Seymour on Saturday to sign with the 49ers' practice squad if he did not get claimed off waivers.
