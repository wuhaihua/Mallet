Former Bulls center Nazr Mohammed works out for Heat Former Bulls center Nazr Mohammed works out for Heat  Luol Deng might not be the only former Chicago Bull suiting up in South Beach next season.
Unrestricted free agent Nazr Mohammed worked out for the Miami Heat and met with team executives last Thursday. Mohammed, 36, played 80 games in his second season with the Bulls last year, averaging 1.6 points and 2.2 rebounds behind the Bulls' talented frontcourt of Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson and Carlos Boozer. He became expendable when the Bulls signed free agent Pau Gasol and brought over former first-round draft pick Nikola Mirotic and signed him to a three-year deal.
According to the Miami Herald's report, the Heat are also interested in free agents Emeka Okafor and Andray Blatche to help fill the void left by Greg Oden.

Mohammed has played for eight different teams in his 16-year NBA career, and he's got some recent history with Miami. Though LeBron James signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers this summer, it was he who Mohammed shoved to the floor during Game 3 of the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals after James threw Mohammed down following a hard foul. Mohammed was ejected for the incident while James received a technical foul for the play.
Deng, who the Bulls traded to Cleveland in January after 10 seasons in Chicago, signed a two-year, $20 million deal with the Heat in July. And though James is gone, Deng's arrival as well as the return of Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and a host of other players should continue to make Bulls-Heat one of the more hotly contested rivalries in the NBA.
Mohammed wouldn't have a major impact behind Bosh and Chris Andersen, but it would add a second Bulls player in the rival colors.
