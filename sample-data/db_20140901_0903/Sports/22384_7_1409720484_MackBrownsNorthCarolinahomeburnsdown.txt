                    Mack Brown&rsquo;s home in North Carolina burned down, according to KVUE in Austin, Texas.

The former Texas coach recently moved a lot of his Longhorn memorabilia to the home, according to the report,&nbsp;which is located closer to the ESPN studio in Charlotte where he works as a college football analyst.

On Tuesday, Brown &mdash;&nbsp;who also spent 10 seasons as head coach at North Carolina &mdash;&nbsp;addressed the fire on Twitter.


Thx for your thoughts and prayers about the loss of our house. Tough deal, but thanks. Blessed everyone is fine and we are moving forward.
&mdash; Mack Brown (@ESPN_CoachMack) September 2, 2014


Brown was Texas head coach for 16 seasons before stepping down at the end of last season. He was 158-48 with the Longhorns that included a BCS title in 2005. He is 244-122-1 overall. &nbsp;
