St. Louis Rams claim Case Keenum on waivers St. Louis Rams claim Case Keenum on waivers Aug 28, 2014; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum (7) attempts a pass during the first quarter against the San Francisco 49ers at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsNFL    It&rsquo;s the circle of&nbsp;quarterbacks. Patriots&rsquo; rookie Jimmy Garoppolo emerged just as Sam Bradford got inured. Garoppolo&rsquo;s strong performances allowed the Texans to get former Patriots&rsquo; backup Ryan Mallett. The arrival of Mallett in Houston meant the departure of Case Keenum. Now, Keenum has&nbsp;been claimed on waivers by the St. Louis Rams.  Keenum is by no means&nbsp;the proclaimed starter. Shaun Hill is the incumbent. Keenum isn&rsquo;t even a sure thing to make the roster. If he&nbsp;can get to speed, then he could potentially be the Rams&rsquo; backup over Austin Davis. He will, however, start as the third-string quarterback and work his way up. He threw for 1,760 yards, nine touchdowns and six interceptions last season for Texans. He finished 0-8 as starter with a very poor performing Texans&rsquo; squad. Via ESPN&rsquo;s Adam Schefter, the Rams did a great deal of research on Keenum in the last 24 hours. Keenum performed as well as he could with the team he was given. To his credit, no other quarterback on the roster played as well as he did. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Rams are done with their moves at quarterback. Keenum was a second-string behind Ryan Fitzapatrick for a reason &mdash; and Fitzpartick is expected to be one of the worst NFL starting quarterbacks in the league.&nbsp;It seems more like a desperation move than anything.&nbsp;They will likely continue to pursue more viable options by trade.
