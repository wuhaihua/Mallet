Wilson will be opening day starter Wilson will be opening day starter 
SARASOTA, Fla. -- Cincinnati right-hander     Paul Wilson will start on opening day when the Reds meet the     New York Mets on April 4.  Manager Dave Miley said Wednesday that left-hander Eric Milton and right-hander     Ramon Ortiz, Cincinnati's top two offseason additions, will follow Wilson in the rotation.  Wilson was 11-6 last season with a 4.36 earned run average in 29 starts.  There is still competition for the last two spots in the rotation, with     Brandon Claussen,     Aaron Harang, Jeriome Robertson and     Josh Hancock among the candidates.     Luke Hudson fell out of the competition because of tendinitis in his right shoulder that will require rest and rehabilitation.  "He won't throw until he has done all that we ask him to do without pain or stiffness," Reds trainer Mark Mann said.  The Reds also optioned infielder William Bergolla, pitcher Daylan Childress and pitcher Brian Shackelford to Triple-A Louisville. They optioned pitchers     Ben Kozlowski,     Bubba Nelson and      Elizardo Ramirez to Double-A Chattanooga.  Left-hander Phil Dumatrait and catcher Miguel Perez were optioned to Class A Sarasota. Infielders Travis Chapman and A.J. Zapp, outfielder Kenny Kelly, catcher Brian Peterson and pitcher Jared Fernandez were assigned to the Reds' minor league camp.
