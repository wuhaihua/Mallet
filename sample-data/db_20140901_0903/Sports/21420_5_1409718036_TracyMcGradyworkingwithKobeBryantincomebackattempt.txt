Mandatory Credit: Richard Mackson-USA TODAY SportsNBA    After trying his hand at pitching in minor league baseball, two-time NBA scoring champion Tracy McGrady has continued to say he has no interest in a potential NBA comeback.  However, that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports, McGrady has actually been working out with Los Angeles Lakers&rsquo; guard Kobe Bryant in hopes that he can make an NBA comeback. &ldquo;Yes, I was working out with K.B. to get in shape and see how my body feels,&rdquo; McGrady told Yahoo Sports in an email Tuesday night. Bryant and McGrady, 35, worked out three days a week for a period of time in August, several sources, including McGrady, told Yahoo. At least two NBA teams were contacted over the summer about their potential interest in McGrady, but none registered a desire to further explore the possibility, league executives told Yahoo Sports. 35 normally isn&rsquo;t too old for a player as talented as McGrady to play but with the injuries he&rsquo;s had over his career, it will be hard for him to get back into the league. McGrady probably won&rsquo;t be remembered the way he should because of those injuries and the lack of talent surrounding him during his four seasons in Orlando (2000-2004) but he may have been the best scorer in the league during that time &ndash; he was first in points per game in both the 2001-2002 season (32.1) and the 2002-2003 season (28.0). Over the course of his career, McGrady averaged 19.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 43.5% from the field, 33.8% from beyond the arc and 74.6% from the free throw line. Bryant averaged&nbsp;13.1 points, 6.3 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 42.5% from the field, 18.8% from beyond the arc and 85.7% from the free throw line last season. Bryant was selected by the Charlotte Hornets (New Orleans Pelicans) with the 13th-overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft and dealt to the Lakers. He has spent all 18 of his NBA seasons in Los Angeles. In his career, he has put up&nbsp;25.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.5 steals per game while shooting 45.4% from the field, 33.5% from three and 83.8% from the charity stripe.
