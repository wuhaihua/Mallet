                    Usually, the #AskSpector Tweetbag runs on Mondays, but this is Tuesday, and here&#39;s a new edition of the #AskSpector Tweetbag. A rip in the space-time continuum? Of course not. It&#39;s just that it was Labor Day weekend, so with a holiday on Monday, the column runs on Tuesday. You may have guessed by now that the words at the top of these columns are just to fill space before answering your questions, and a lead-up to a reminder of how you can ask questions to be answered here, so let&#39;s just get to that. It couldn&#39;t be easier to send an #AskSpector question -- all you have to do is go to Twitter, type a question, affix the #AskSpector hashtag (or reply to a solicitation for questions), and voila, you&#39;re done. Sit back, relax, and wait for the answer here. Speaking of which, here are this week&#39;s questions and answers.


@jessespector #AskSpector What do you do this winter if you&#39;re the Reds?
&mdash; Howard Megdal (@howardmegdal) September 1, 2014


Start with the obvious, and exercise Johnny Cueto&#39;s $10 million option for 2015. Filling out the rest of the rotation, I need to know more about Homer Bailey&#39;s health outlook before deciding whether to shop either Mat Latos or Mike Leake in an effort to boost the lineup. Even if I&#39;m not 100 percent convinced that Bailey is going to be himself in 2015, I might trade one of the other pitchers as they enter their final arbitration years, and get some good young talent back. Hope like hell that Tony Cingrani can contribute and fill out a rotation with Cueto, Latos or Leake, Bailey, a second-tier free agent and Alfredo Simon.

Trade Brandon Phillips. For anything. He&#39;s got three years and $39 million left on his contract, and if somebody will take that off your hands, they are doing you a favor. Take whatever you can get in addition to that favor, sure, but recognize that you&#39;re better off taking Phillips&#39; money and spending it on starting pitching, while getting a lower-cost bad player for second base. Kelly Johnson is a free agent this winter. Hint, hint.

I would do some theological research and pray to as many deities as I can that Bailey, Jay Bruce and Joey Votto are all healthy and play up to their potential. If not, whatever I&#39;m doing here is a waste of time.

I would try to sign Nelson Cruz to play left field and smash balls over fences, particularly in my home ballpark that is conducive to doing so. Melky Cabrera also could be a neat fit in Cincinnati. I would probably fail to get either, and wind up trying something like a Nate Schierholtz/Jonny Gomes platoon.

I would launch Skip Schumaker into the sun.


@jessespector you think the Reds have any chance next year? #AskSpector
&mdash; Nick Richey (@nrichey83) September 2, 2014


Yes, because they&#39;re not going to be horrible, and any team that&#39;s not horrible is going to have a chance to be in the race if health issues cooperate. They&#39;re not going to be favorites, and I probably won&#39;t be picking the Reds as a playoff team next year, but they&#39;ll be in the &quot;wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they made it&quot; category.


@jessespector assuming Jeter gets 2 retired, who is the next Yankee to get a number retired? #askspector
&mdash; Math Happens (@MathHappens51) August 30, 2014


The Yankees will be retiring 2 &mdash; it&#39;s not an &quot;if&quot; question. I think 51 should go up next for Bernie Williams, before Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, who I would imagine get the honor eventually. Paul O&#39;Neill also belongs, given that Yankees fans all but rioted when they gave 21 to LaTroy Hawkins. Oh, and then there&#39;s a certain guy who won two MVPs as a Yankee but isn&#39;t playing this year because Major League Baseball went outside the law to get a guy who sells drugs to children to squeal on him. What was that guy&#39;s name? Why can&#39;t I remember him? You know who I mean, though, the guy who opted out of his contract during the World Series that one time and annoyed everybody by making it about himself.


@jessespector If you&#39;re the Orioles, do you trade Matt Wieters in the off-season? #AskSpector
&mdash; Dave S (@BmoreDaveS) August 30, 2014


I would not be actively seeking a deal, but if someone comes along with a great offer, sure. Wieters is coming off elbow surgery, and even though this is his last winter before free agency, it&#39;s hard to trade someone when you know you&#39;ll be getting back less than you otherwise might. The Orioles are likely to be better off keeping Wieters into next season, thinking about trading him if they&#39;re not in the race, or holding onto him, trying to work out a long-term deal, and cashing in if he leaves with a compensatory draft pick for the qualifying offer he&#39;d receive. Caleb Joseph has done nicely for himself, but Wieters should still have the starting job waiting for him when he&#39;s healthy.


@jessespector Why is a bullpen called a bullpen? (I know, google, but I prefer #AskSpector)
&mdash; Tadd Haislop (@TaddHaislop) September 1, 2014


Actually, Wikipedia over Google, and I happen to like a lot of the possible explanations listed for the origin of the term bullpen. I like the literal approach, that it&#39;s a parallel to bulls being kept in a pen. That makes me think of Bugs Bunny.




@jessespector When do you think the NL will get the DH?
&mdash; Mary Lawlor (@MaryL1973) August 30, 2014


Eventually, but I don&#39;t know exactly when. It&#39;s a bargaining chip, because it would be creating more high-paying jobs for the union in the National League. The possibility of bringing the DH to the Senior Circuit represents huge leverage for the owners, but there is no way to know when they would cash it in.


@jessespector #AskSpector who wins a World Series first. Marlins or cubs.
&mdash; Evan (@Evan_B22) September 1, 2014


Obviously the Cubs, as the scrolls of the North Side Church of McFly have told us that 2015 is the year.


@jessespector What are realistic options for the Mets at LF/SS next season? #AskSpector
&mdash; Sam (@Crazy4NYSports) August 30, 2014


There are too many to list, because it depends what direction the Mets decide to go at each position. There are incumbents, trade candidates, and free agents. Seriously, if we jumped in a time machine right now, and went to Queens next April, I would be surprised to see Mike Trout at shortstop and Clayton Kershaw in left field, but there are few combinations of people who actually play those positions that would catch me off guard.


.@jessespector is Phil Kessel fast enough to turn the lights out in his bedroom and get under the covers before it gets dark? #AskSpector
&mdash; Chemmy (@felixpotvin) September 1, 2014


Unless Cool Papa Bell changed his name to Phil Kessel, then probably not, although in Bell&#39;s day, the technology did not exist that would make it possible for Kessel to actually do this. Perhaps his bedroom lights are on dimmers, and once he hits the switch, he has a second or two to get under the covers as the lights gradually turn down. I&#39;ve never actually seen a setup like this, but it&#39;s plausible, if you&#39;re the kind of person who wants to say that they are fast enough to get under the covers before the lights are out, or if you are scared of tripping over things in your bedroom in the dark. If the latter were the case, though, you probably would buy The Clapper, get into bed, and then clap the lights off.



Can we talk for a second about how the commercial for The Clapper includes a commercial for Chia Pet?

&nbsp;


@jessespector Of all the sports in the world, which sport has the best opening day and why? #AskSpector
&mdash; Mark (@CBJTherapy) September 1, 2014


NASCAR, with Daytona. What other sports league starts the season with its very biggest event? It&#39;s fantastic.


.@jessespector hi can you send out good vibes to @willvrag the @RaysBaseball photog for @TBTimes_Sports - he has cancer. cc @TBTimes_JSmith
&mdash; Christine L Mendon&ccedil;a (@chrislmendonca) September 2, 2014


Cancer is the worst. Beat it and get well soon!


@jessespector Why do evil people hate pumpkin flavored drinks? #AskSpector
&mdash; Greg Kessler (@GJFKessler) September 1, 2014


Drink whatever you want. I don&#39;t care if you like swigging down whatever chemicals Starbucks dumps into your coffee, or whatever combinations of ingredients it takes to pumpkin up your beer. I just want to stop hearing about how great pumpkin is as a beverage. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s just something that people use to distract themselves from the fact that winter is coming and it&#39;s miserable, and we&#39;re all going to die someday. That&#39;s what the pumpkin is emblematic of, after all &mdash; Halloween, the jack o&#39;lantern, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, and grim death. Enjoy your beverage.


@jessespector what should i have for lunch?
&mdash; ctrent (@ctrent) September 1, 2014


Chicken salad on rye, untoasted, with a side of potato salad and a cup of tea.



It&#39;s the lunch of winners!


@jessespector Why am I not watching college football? #AskSpector
&mdash; Chris Creamer (@sportslogosnet) August 30, 2014


I&#39;m sure you have your reasons, but if I had to guess, I would say that it&#39;s because you&#39;re busy enjoying life in other ways, and it&#39;s quite possible that at the moment I&#39;m getting around to answering this question, there isn&#39;t any live college football to watch.


@jessespector #AskSpector CFB or NFL, which do you prefer? Also, if Brian Boyle falls and no one is around to hear it does he make a sound?
&mdash; Tim Crescenzo (@TCrescen) August 30, 2014


I prefer pro football to college, but I will watch anything. Yes, if a person falls, they make a sound.


@jessespector will the Sharks win the Pacific Division? Western Conference? And/or the Cup? #AskSpector
&mdash; GJ Berg (@LadyStanley) August 31, 2014


No. No. Also no.


@jessespector Who has the best baseball network as far as great coverage of baseball: ESPN, MLB Network, Fox Sports, or TBS? #AskSpector
&mdash; Troy Johnson Jr. (@TroySports1) August 31, 2014


This is all about personal preference. For me, it&#39;s MLB Network.


@jessespector #askspector Is there a Beatles song that would appropriately describe the way Everton&#39;s season has gone thus far?
&mdash; Andrew John (@andyt4579) August 31, 2014


Helter Skelter seems to fit.


@jessespector Do you think Dilson Herrera got here so fast? Or he is ready?#AskSpector
&mdash; Ramli (@rxerezburgos) August 30, 2014


It hurts nobody if the Mets to use September to see what they&#39;ve got in Herrera, and so far, he looks like what you might expect -- a talented, young player who has not worked out all the kinks in his game. It should be good for him to see that at the major league level, and then he can fight for a job in spring training, probably be kept on the farm to limit his service time, and then called up in the middle of next summer unless he blows everyone away big time. I think he is ready for the chance he is getting right now.


@jessespector If James Bond were a fan of the EPL, who would he cheer for? #askspector
&mdash; Blaynecicle (@Blaynecicle) August 31, 2014


Liverpool, perhaps? &quot;You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; could be a pretty bad Bond movie, too.


@jessespector Do u like gladiator movies? You ever seen a grown man naked?
&mdash; Murdoch (@Brainsonwall) August 31, 2014


Yes and yes. I&#39;ve never been to a Turkish prison, though, and I don&#39;t care one way or the other when it comes to Greco-Roman wrestling.

&nbsp;


@jessespector How much longer til we see Canadian Rules Baseball?
&mdash; Matt Riegler (@MattRiegler) August 31, 2014


&nbsp;

Just as soon as Toronto realizes that it&#39;s the Blue Jays&#39; best chance to ever win anything. It&#39;ll be pretty interesting to see baseball played with three bases.

&nbsp;


@jessespector Family Guy or American Dad??
&mdash; Astros Future (@AstrosFuture) August 31, 2014


&nbsp;

I&#39;m not particularly a fan of either one. Family Guy is better than Knockoff Family Guy, though.

&nbsp;


@jessespector #AskSpector Would you take a couple bad season of pitching if meant that you would be dating Kate Upton.
&mdash; Casey Dulson (@Casey_Trouble) September 1, 2014


&nbsp;

So, you&#39;re basically Indecent Proposal-ing me. I&#39;m happily married, but the money that would come from trading lives with Justin Verlander for a couple of years would be life-changing. At the same time, I can&#39;t imagine what Kate Upton and I have in common. She seems to like sports, so that&#39;s cool, but she&#39;s also way younger than me. I don&#39;t want to date her. I don&#39;t want to date anybody. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m not single. It&#39;s really nice on this side. The real question is if I can have an eight-figure salary for a couple of years, while also living out the dream of pitching in the major leagues. Those things are more appealing to me.

&nbsp;


@jessespector Boxers or Briefs? #AskSpector
&mdash; Rob (@RobMc82) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

Boxer briefs.

&nbsp;


@jessespector #askspector is anyone more overrated than Van Morrison?
&mdash; crago (@ryancrago) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

Yes. Pearl Jam, for sure.

&nbsp;


@jessespector Rex Hudler or Bert Blyleven?
&mdash; Jeff Parker (@RoyallySpeaking) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

Also more overrated than Van Morrison, yes.

&nbsp;


@jessespector #AskSpector how many eggs are too many to eat in a single day?
&mdash; CorneliusHardenbergh (@HBAdventure) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

It really depends on your specific digestive system. I try to avoid eating more than two dozen eggs in any single day. So far, I have been successful.

&nbsp;


#AskSpector better NHL market Nordiques 2.0 or 2nd team in Toronto?
&mdash; Jabber (@Jabber28) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

Quebec would be a better choice than adding another Toronto team.

&nbsp;


Have all of those UTV tapes been destroyed?? RT @jessespector: Last call for #AskSpector questions for this week!
&mdash; MJ (@mhj_5) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

All the tapes I ever had from Penn&#39;s campus TV station were on VHS, and I neither have a VCR nor do I know where the tapes are. So, while they may not have been destroyed, video archives of &quot;QuakerTalk&quot; are unavailable, which is probably for the best for all of us.

&nbsp;


@jessespector Are you a Marius or a Sulla guy? Would you credit Marius with inventing line changes? #AskSpector
&mdash; TheJPF (@JohnPaulFutbol) August 30, 2014


&nbsp;

I remember those names from a long-ago history class, but I can&#39;t say I have a favorite. I credit Mariusz Czerkawski with inventing line changes.

&nbsp;


@jessespector what&#39;s the one food item you wish was fried but isn&#39;t? #askSpector
&mdash; Troy Machir (@TroyMachir) September 2, 2014


&nbsp;

This is a trick question, right? You can get fried ice cream, of all things. Fried beer exists! If you want it fried, you can get it fried. I&#39;ve never seen fried peanut butter and jelly. I know it exists. I&#39;d like to try that.

&nbsp;


@jessespector Are you a fan of sprinkles or extra icing on cupcakes or both #AskSpector
&mdash; James Centifonti (@JCentifonti) August 26, 2014


&nbsp;

Both, of course. Who wouldn&#39;t say both? Between the two, I&#39;d rather have sprinkles with a normal amount of icing.

&nbsp;


@jessespector What won the #Boobs #Butts Twitter experiment? #AskSpector
&mdash; Carcel Mousineau (@CarcelMousineau) August 30, 2014


&nbsp;

So, last week, I decided to do a little experiment, using Twitter&#39;s analytics, to see which would generate more of a response: boobs or butts. I tweeted &quot;boobs,&quot; and then I tweeted &quot;butts,&quot; and then I watched the numbers. It was very close, but boobs came out the winner.

&nbsp;


@jessespector What do you think about boobs and butts? #askspector #boobs #butts
&mdash; 95Sports (@95Sports) August 28, 2014


&nbsp;

I think they&#39;re great.

&nbsp;


@jessespector #AskSpector I like to compare teams to a full balanced meals. If GMs did this they would be more successful..Why don&#39;t they?
