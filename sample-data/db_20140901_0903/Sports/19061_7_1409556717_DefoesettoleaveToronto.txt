			Former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe may be heading back to the Premier League after just five months playing for Toronto FC in the MLS.Defoe has been linked with a move away from Toronto following the sacking of Ryan Nelsen as coach after their 3-0 defeat by the New England Revolution on Saturday. Toronto general manager Tim Bezbatchenko confirmed that the club have received an offer for the striker from an undisclosed club, but Sky sources say a move to join former manager Harry Redknapp at QPR is unlikely.  Redknapp signed the 31-year-old, who has scored 15 goals in 16 league games for Toronto, while in charge at his previous two clubs Tottenham and Portsmouth.Bezbatchenko said: "We have received an offer and have discussed it internally."When you have scored as many goals as he has, and have the reputation and background that he has, then it's not uncommon to receive these offers."We have received multiple offers before, and in the course of this year, so I want to confirm that we are in talks."We are not 100 per cent committed in what we are doing and we have to sit down and talk about what is the best plan of action."
