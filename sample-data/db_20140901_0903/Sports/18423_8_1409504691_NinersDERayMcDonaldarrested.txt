Police in Northern California say         San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman         Ray McDonald has been arrested on domestic violence charges.

     

San Jose police Sgt. Heather Randol says the 29-year-old defensive end was taken into custody early Sunday after officers responded to a home in an upscale neighborhood at 2:48 a.m. local time.

McDonald was jailed on felony domestic violence charges.

He has been playing for San Francisco since he was drafted as a third round pick in 2007.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced tougher punishments last week for players convicted of domestic violence.
