Brady on Mankins, Mallett deals: 'These things are never easy' Brady on Mankins, Mallett deals: 'These things are never easy' September 2, 2014, 9:15 am It made sense that Tom Brady wasn't all too pleased about the trade that sent Logan Mankins to Tampa Bay. When you spend nearly a decade with a guy as one of your most reliable body guards, you're bound to grow attached.
But whatever emotions were spent in the moments following last week's deal aren't worth rehashing, Brady told WEEI on Tuesday.
“I haven’t really spoken to anybody about it,” Brady said. “I have my own personal feelings that obviously are very personal to me. Whatever those are, I just want our team to be the best it can be for this year. I love Logan, Logan was a great friend of mine. Nobody stood for Patriot football more than him. But he’s moved on. I hope he’s happy. We’ll keep in touch."
The common theme last week inside the Patriots locker room following the Mankins deal was that football players are people, too. Almost every player who spoke to members of the media about Mankins spoke about what kind of man he was. Mankins was a great football player, sure, they said. But it's what he brought as a teammate and friend off the field that stood out to many of them.
It was difficult for them to see him go.
Though Brady is going into his 15th professional season, he said it's never easy watching a buddy's locker cleared out. 
“Absolutely not,” Brady said. “I’m a very person-to-person type of person. I am a very emotional person. I don’t think those things have ever gotten easier for me. And I don’t think they ever will. But you’ve got to come to grips with it also, and learn to deal with things in a mature way.
“We as players, the business side of things, we’re there to play, we aren’t there to run businesses. We’re there to enjoy the camaraderie with our teammates, enjoy the playing experience with our teammates. We play for one another, and you deal with whatever comes up and then you move forward. I think that’s part of the sport. Being that it’s happened, I know it’s going to happen next year, too, I know it’s going to happen the year after that, the year after that — for as long as you continue playing here you’re going to be dealing with this.
“But now we’ve got a chance to move forward, to move forward with the start of the year. And you’ve got to bring the best attitude you can when it matters to the most, which is now.”
The timing of the trade -- less than two weeks before the start of the regular season -- was tricky. One the one hand, it left the offensive line without its most experienced starter with little time to re-adjust. On the other, it forced Mankins' former teammates, Brady included, to swallow hard and move on quickly.
With the season-opener against the Dolphins on the horizon for this Sunday, the Patriots can't spend much time shaking their heads in disbelief.
“We’ve got a game to win," Brady said. "I can’t really think too much about what happened in the past. Like I said, yeah, I dealt with whatever feelings I had last week, but I’ve moved on. I’ve got to move on, because that’s what this team expects me to do. With Miami coming in, the only thought on my mind is how I can be the best quarterback against them, and how I can can try to go out there and lead my teammates and be a great example, and be a great motivator, and bring the enthusiasm and energy for the team. Because without that then we have less opportunity to win. And you guys know me, I like winning.”
The hits kept coming for Brady over the weekend.
Another of his close friends on the team, backup quarterback Ryan Mallett, was traded away in a deal with the Texans that sent the former third-round pick to Houston in exchange for a conditional seventh-round selection. 
Brady said there wasn't much time to sit and reflect with Mallett over the three years they spent together before Mallett took off. 
“All these things that happen, they happen really quick,” Brady said. “I know coach said there were 800 transactions or something on Saturday. You show up to work one day, everyone’s there, you’ve got 90 guys or whatever, then the next day you show up and there’s 53. There’s not really time to sit around the table and talk about how great things have been . . . In Ryan’s particular situation he’s moving on with his life, and the Patriots move on. You wish each other luck. We’ll always keep in touch. I keep in touch with Matt Cassel and Damon Huard and Brian Hoyer. I keep in touch with all these guys, because they’re my friends. It’s not football, it’s personal. Those guys will be friends for the rest of my life, certainly Ryan will be, too."
As was the case with Mankins, Brady knows he can't let the changing nature of his friendship with Mallett disrupt this week's preparations.
“These things are never easy," Brady said. "It doesn’t take away from any personal relationship. It’s a business relationship that the organization has with particular players. Like I said, everyone deals with them differently. But the way that we deal with it is we choose to deal with it, you move on, and certainly this week and yesterday and on, we’re just focused on the Miami Dolphins, and how we can go out there and put together the best plan to go out there and kick some butt on Sunday.”  It made sense that Tom Brady wasn't all too pleased about the trade that sent Logan Mankins to Tampa Bay.
