                    WACO, Texas &mdash; Quarterback Bryce Petty didn&#39;t play after halftime of No. 10 Baylor&#39;s season opener because of a bruise to his lower back.

Petty was clearly in discomfort several times in the first half against SMU on Sunday night. He took a shot early in the game.

Seth Russell took over at quarterback after halftime.

While it wasn&#39;t exactly clear when Petty got hurt, he grabbed at his lower back and side several times while playing the entire first half as the Bears took a 31-0 lead. He was gingerly moving at the end of several plays.

Petty completed 13 of 23 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for another score, and got up slowly after being hit going into the end zone on a 5-yard score.
