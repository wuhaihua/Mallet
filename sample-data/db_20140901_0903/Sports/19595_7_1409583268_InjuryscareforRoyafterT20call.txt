								Injury scare for Roy after T20 call
							
						
					
				
			
			Jason Roy has allayed fears he could miss the NatWest Twenty20 International against India after confirming the blow he took to his hand is not serious.Roy was the top run scorer in the NatWest T20 Blast competition this summer, piling up 677 runs at an average of 48.35 and a sensational scoring rate of nearly 160 runs per 100 balls.But he was hurt in Surrey's clash with New Zealand A on Sunday and had to be taken to hospital for scans after being hit on the hand.An X-ray revealed that Roy had avoided a break and the big-hitting Surrey batsman has revealed he should be available for selection for the one-off T20I at Edgbaston on September 7."I tried to bat on for a bit, but then got a bit worried about it," he said."So I went for an X-ray to make sure I got peace of mind."It should be absolutely fine in a couple of days. A bit of ice (treatment) and rest, and it should be sweet."The uncapped 24-year-old is one of four players in the T20I squad not involved in the current Royal London One-Day Series to be named, joining Essex all-rounder Ravi Bopara, Yorkshire seamer Tim Bresnan and Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor.“This is a huge opportunity for me,” Roy added."It's a dream of mine since I was a pup. I hope I can get a few runs and win a game for them."Bresnan's availability could be in question, though, after he was omitted from the Yorkshire side to face Lancashire in the Roses Match as a precaution - he has been bothered by a pectoral injury.Taylor will be involved with the Nottinghamshire Outlaws in their Royal London Cup semi-final on September 6 and will only join up with the England squad if that game concludes on time, without the need for the reserve day.Eoin Morgan will captain the side at Edgbaston in the absence of Stuart Broad, who is scheduled to have surgery on his knee this week.Also missing from the squad defeated by Sri Lanka in this format back in May are Ian Bell and Michael Carberry.Selector James Whitaker said: "This one-off NatWest International T20 provides us with an opportunity to look at players who have impressed recently in domestic cricket and gives them a chance to test themselves on the international stage against high quality opposition."Squad: Eoin Morgan (capt), Moeen Ali, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler, Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Jason Roy, James Taylor, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes.
