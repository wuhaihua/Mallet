Power play Power play September 2, 2014, 10:45 pm NEW YORK - The Red Sox aren't going anywhere but home in October.
On Tuesday night, they played like they were trying to ensure that the Yankees find themselves in the same predicament.
In the opener of the next-to-last series between the two rivals this season, the Red Sox blasted three homers and beat up the Yankees, 9-4.
Daniel Nava homered for the first time since April and Xander Bogaerts added his first home run since the end of July two batters later. Mookie Betts rounded out the power attack in the next inning, homering for the third time on the current road trip.
Betts and Bogaerts combined for seven hits. Bogaerts enjoyed the first four-hit game of his career while Betts produced his fourth multi-hit game in the last five contests.
Before the home runs began to fly, the Red Sox had built a 2-0 lead off Shane Greene in the first on a run-scoring double by Yoenis Cespedes and a sacrifice fly by Mike Napoli.
Napoli would add a second sacrifice fly in the ninth, plating Yoenis Cespedes (three hits) who had tripled.
All that offense made the night easier for starter Joe Kelly, who cruised through the first four innings allowing just one hit -- a solo homer to Martin Prado to open the third.
Kelly began to falter some in the middle innings, issuing two walks in the fifth, including one with the bases loaded to force in another run.
Another run scored on a bases-loaded single by Derek Jeter, who was initially ruled out at first before the Yanks challenged the call and got it overturned.
Kelly earned his first win in six starts with the Red Sox, pitching into the seventh before giving way to Tommy Layne.
 
STAR OF THE GAME: Xander Bogaerts
Bogaerts had his first career four-hit night -- including a homer -- to continue to build on the hot streak he's put together since coming off the disabled list Saturday. In the four games since, he's collected six hits -- four of them for extra bases.
HONORABLE MENTION: Mookie Betts
Betts continued to wield a hot bat, collecting three hits -- two singles and a homer -- to go along with a hard lineout to left, and just for good measure, a nice catch crashing into the wall in the bottom of the fourth to take away extra bases from Mark Teixeira.
GOAT OF THE GAME: Shane Greene
The Yankees' are still alive in the wild card race, but Greene, New York's starting pitcher, didn't get the homestand off to a good start, shelled for six runs before the third inning was over.
TURNING POINT: The three-run homer by Daniel Nava in the third took a 2-0 Red Sox lead and turned the game into a romp at 5-0.
BY THE NUMBERS: The homer by Nava was his first in four and a half months, dating back to April 15.
QUOTE TO NOTE: "This season has been a weird one, a tough one. But I keep coming to the park every day and working toward days like this.'' -- Xander Bogaerts, after his first career four-hit game.  NEW YORK - The Red Sox aren't going anywhere but home in October.
