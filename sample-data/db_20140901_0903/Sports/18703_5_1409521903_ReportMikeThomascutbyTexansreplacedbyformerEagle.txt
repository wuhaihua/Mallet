The #Texans cut WR Mike Thomas after claiming former #Eagles WR Damaris Johnson, source says. &mdash; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) August 31, 2014 Mike Thomas, 27, was drafted in the&nbsp;fourth-round by the Jaguars in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was traded to Detroit in 2012 for&nbsp;a fifth-round selection in the 2014 draft.  According to NBC Sports, the Texans have signed former Eagles wide receiver, Damaris Johnson&nbsp;to replace Thomas. Johnson, 24, was undrafted from Tulsa in 2012 but quickly signed with the Philadelphia Eagles.  Johnson had 21 catches in two seasons with the Eagles and returned a punt for a touchdown. The Eagles wanted to trade Johnson before the roster cutting on Saturday, but according to NBC Sports, they weren&rsquo;t able to due to lack of interest for Johnson. Johnson now joins a Texans team that just signed New England Patriots quarterback Ryan Mallet and is in their first year under former Penn State coach Bill O&rsquo;Brien. Johnson joins receivers Andre Johnson, DeAndre Hopkins and Keshawn Martin among other wideouts on the team this season. &nbsp;
