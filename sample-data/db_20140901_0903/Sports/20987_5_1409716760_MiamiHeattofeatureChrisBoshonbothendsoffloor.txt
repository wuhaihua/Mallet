Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY SportsNBA    When Chris Bosh decided to sign with the Miami Heat in 2010, he knew he&rsquo;d essentially become the third wheel behind LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.  Such a role didn&rsquo;t seem to bother him, though playing Tito to both James and Wade didn&rsquo;t last long as Chris Bosh eventually emerged as the Miami Heat&rsquo;s second option on offense given the health woes of Dwyane Wade. Of course, being a featured player wasn&rsquo;t new to Chris Bosh considering he was the face of the Toronto Raptors franchise before joining the Heat. Now it&rsquo;s something that he&rsquo;ll likely have to embrace yet again with James no longer in South Beach and Wade a shell of his former self. Will he be up for the challenge? It certainly seems that way and the Miami Heat plan to make Bosh a centerpiece of their team moving forward as he&rsquo;ll be heavily featured on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court says Chuck Myron. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll gun for 30 every night, since that&rsquo;s not in his personality, nor is it in Erik Spoelstra&rsquo;s personality to allow him to do that, but Bosh will be featured heavily on both ends of the floor. It&rsquo;s understood the Miami Heat are not going to be the dominant team they&rsquo;ve been recently, though Chris Bosh had no problems leading a suspect Toronto Raptors team to the postseason and shouldn&rsquo;t have much trouble doing the same in South Beach, especially given the help surrounding him. He may not be the prototypical franchise player, but he has certainly earned his stripes and shown an ability to lead before.
