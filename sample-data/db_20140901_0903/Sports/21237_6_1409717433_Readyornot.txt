Ready or not? Ready or not? September 2, 2014, 12:30 pm Rob Gronkowski says he's ready to go, but do the Patriots feel the same way?
Asked about Gronkowski's status in a conference call on Tuesday, coach Bill Belichick explained that there has not been a final decision made as to whether or not the 6-foot-6 tight end will take the field in Miami on Sunday.
"I'm glad that Rob's optimistic about this situation," Belichick said. "We'll go through the week of practice and take a look at everything, everybody, and see where everybody's at and try to do what we feel like is best for the team. With all due respect to Rob -- I'm glad he feels the way he does -- but, in the end, we'll have to make the decision we feel like is best for the team and we'll do that as we go through the week."
