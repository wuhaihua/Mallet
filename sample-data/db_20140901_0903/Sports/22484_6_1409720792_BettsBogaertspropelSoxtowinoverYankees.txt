Betts, Bogaerts propel Sox to win over Yankees Betts, Bogaerts propel Sox to win over Yankees September 2, 2014, 11:45 pm NEW YORK - One is trying to use the final month of the season to salvage what has been an otherwise disappointing year. The other is trying to take advantage of a late-season opportunity to stake his claim for next season.
Together, for one night at least, Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts looked unstoppable in a 9-4 Red Sox triumph over the New York Yankees.
Bogaerts enjoyed the first four-hit game of his career and continued to flourish since returning from a seven-day stint on the concussion DL.
Betts, meanwhile, had three hits and a terrific catch running into the center field wall.
Both contributed solo homers to the Red Sox' 12-hit attack.
In four games since returning from the DL, Bogaerts has seven hits -- five for extra-base hits -- but he's reluctant to make too much of the current hot streak.
"I'm just working with the hitting coaches and trying to get my comfort zone back,'' said Bogaerts, "trying to feel comfortable at the plate, and trying to stop thinking too much -- just let it go. I kind of got away from my approach and I'm trying to get back to that and be on time and just not missing pitches.
"In between at-bats, you make the adjustments that you need to. Just stay with your approach, stay with a plan.''
Bogaerts is still not 100 percent physically after missing a week with a concussion. His body aches because of the inactivity he had, but at the very least, the time away from the game enabled him to refresh himself mentally.
"Definitely, it was a mental breather,'' he said. "Not playing for a while and just being able to relax, that definitely helped the mental side.''
"Looking at what he's done since he's returned to us,'' said John Farrell, "it looks like a few days down rejuventated him some. He's hitting with some confidence now. It's good to see him bounce back and get on a little bit of a run here.''
Occasionally, Bogaerts reminds himself that he's just 21 and for all the hype and expectations, there's still plenty of time to become the special player many had forecast.
"This season has been a weird one, a tough one,'' he acknowledged. "But I keep coming to the park every day and working toward days like this. I'm really hard on myself sometimes and it's tough not to (expect more). But lately, I've thought a few times that I'm just 21. I'm not Albert Pujols or any of those guys yet. I've got to wait.
"Especially playing in the post-season last year, I think a lot of people thought I was 30 or something. But the reality is I'm just 21.''
Betts, too, is 21, and made his debut in this very ballpark just over two months ago. He's since been returned to Pawtucket twice, but in this, his third stint with the big league club, he seems to have found himself.
He singled in the first, homered in the fourth and singled again in the fifth for the first three-hit game of his career and fourth multi-hit game in his last five.
In this most recent stretch, since returning to the club in mid-August, he's hitting .315 (17-for-54) with three doubles, three homers and seven RBI in 15 games.
"I saw the ball well today,'' recounted Betts, "and tried to put some good swings on some good pitches.''
And the more Betts plays, the more comfortable he feels.
"Just being around and being in the atmosphere,'' said Betts, "you eventually settle in and just having the opportunity to play more has definitely helped. I think I've seen a lot of progress (in myself) -- a lot of things I've learned in the outfield, hitting as well, baserunning...Every aspect of the game. I've learned a lot.''
One player seeking retribution. Another trying to seize the moment. 
"The season's definitely has not been the way we all wanted, the way we expected it to be,'' said Bogaerts. "But there's a lot of talent coming up and hopefully we can blend together and have a good future.''
