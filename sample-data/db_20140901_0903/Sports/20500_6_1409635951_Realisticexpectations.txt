Realistic expectations? Realistic expectations? September 2, 2014, 12:45 am Rob Gronkowski is officially ready to come back.
Coming back from a serious knee injury, many wonder what condition Gronk will be in when he steps on the field on week one.
Andy Hart of Patriots Football Weekly joined Sports Tonight to share his expectations for the tight end.
"I think it's to put the ball in the endzone," said Hart. "A game without a touchdown for Gronk is a rare game.  We saw it last year, he could not have had a worse offseason with the back, broken arm, infections and everything. What did he do? He came out, he scored touchdowns, he changed the offense."
Are Hart's expectations realistic?
"I think it is, because his two greatest strengths are his size and his hands.  He still has those," he said.  
Bob Neumeier believes a healthy Gronk s key to the success of the Patriots.
"A healthy Gronkowski, to me, puts the Patriots on a pedestal with the Denver Broncos," said Neumeier. " I think Denver has the edge, but I think if Gronkowski comes back, and is the old Gronkowski or at least 90% of it, maybe they 're equal to or better than the Denver Broncos."
