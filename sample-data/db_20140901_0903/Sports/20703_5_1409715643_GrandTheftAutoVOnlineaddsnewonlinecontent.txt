Grand Theft Auto V Online adds new online content Grand Theft Auto V Online adds new online content Rockstar GamesGaming    Grand Theft Auto V was released as one of the largest video game experiences on consoles ever.&nbsp; The title was received very warmly by critics and has long been a staple amongst gamers repertoire.&nbsp; Rockstar has continued to support the game well past launch, and a new online update continues that trend.  While Grand Theft Auto V is nearly a year old, the content keeps on coming.&nbsp; Thank to new additions, this month, you can play through 16 new jobs, new races and contact missions, and earn double RP all week in a new Flight School Jobs Playlist. There are also two newly announced contact missions: Chop Chop (Contact: Trevor, Rank 43, 2-4 Players) &ldquo;Our friend Ronald is getting increasingly agitated about Merryweather Security&rsquo;s presence in the state, and a nervous Ron gets on my t***. Why don&rsquo;t you go to Sandy Shores Airfield, hack into the Merryweather Network, find their outposts and then take their choppers and blow &lsquo;em all to hell. Okay? Great!&rdquo; Effin&rsquo; Lazers(Contact: Martin, Rank 44, 2 Players) &ldquo;The market&rsquo;s about to be flooded with inferior product. I&hellip; WE&hellip; have too much invested in it to let that happen. I need you to get in some Lazer fighter jets and take out the planes holding product before they land. It sounds extreme, but these are desperate times.&rdquo; Rockstar has continued to redefine the support of a video game.&nbsp; While the remastered version is supposed to still be coming to current generation platforms, the company has made sure to pump out more content for the initial systems. Gamers rejoice!
