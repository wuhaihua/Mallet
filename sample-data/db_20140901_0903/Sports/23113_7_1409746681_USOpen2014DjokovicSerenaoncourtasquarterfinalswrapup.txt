                    Quarterfinal Wednesday at the 2014 U.S. Open brings both top seeds to Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Men&#39;s No. 1 Novak Djokovic will meet No. 8 Andy Murray in the night session&#39;s marquee match. Top seed Serena Williams, the only single-digit seed remaining in the women&#39;s draw, will face No. 11 Flavia Pennetta.



Murray beat Djokovic for both his Grand Slam titles, including the 2012 U.S. Open crown, so this isn&#39;t your typical 1-8 pairing. Murray, though, is coming off a grueling victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in steamy New York conditions&nbsp;a week after combating cramps in his first match.

&quot;That&#39;s really why we play the game. That&#39;s what you put the work in for, so that when you come to these events, and you do have to play against the best players, that you&#39;re ready,&quot; Murray told reporters. &quot;As much as it&#39;s incredibly tough and challenging, the match, that&#39;s what you enjoy.&quot;

Murray is expecting another slog against Djokovic, the 2011 champ and a finalist in the past four Opens.

&quot;A lot of the matches have been long games, long rallies, long points,&quot; Murray said, &quot;because we do a lot of the same things well.&quot;

The other men&#39;s match pits third seed Stan Wawrinka against No. 10 Kei Nishikori. Nishikori bounced No. 5 Milos Raonic in a classic nighttime marathon Monday into Tuesday.

Williams has made one early exit this week, having lost in doubles with sister Venus. History says Serena won&#39;t suffer a similar fate against Pennetta. Williams is 5-0 lifetime against her and has won all but one of the sets they&#39;ve played, and that was in a tiebreaker.

Williams also enters on an 18-match U.S. Open winning streak and has dropped only 17 games in this year&#39;s tournament.

No. 16 Victoria Azarenka and No. 17 Ekaterina Makarova will play in the other women&#39;s quarterfinal.

Azarenka &mdash; the woman Williams beat in the title matches at Flushing Meadows in 2012 and 2013 &mdash; will be playing for a spot in the semifinals alongside Caroline Wozniacki and Peng Shuai. Wozniacki and Shuai who won their quarterfinal matches Tuesday.

Azarenka has won the Australian Open twice and used to be ranked No. 1, but she&#39;s missed time this season because of foot and knee injuries. She delivered what might have been the answer of the tournament when a reporter used the word &quot;suffered&quot; while referencing Azarenka&#39;s recent health problems.

&quot;You&#39;re making it sound like ... I almost died and, you know, there was 10 sharks, and I got attacked, and I survived. And, you know, I saved a dolphin, as well,&quot; Azarenka said. &quot;It&#39;s not that complicated, really. What I enjoy is to play tennis. To be talking about what happened with my injuries, I mean, it&#39;s useless already.&quot;
