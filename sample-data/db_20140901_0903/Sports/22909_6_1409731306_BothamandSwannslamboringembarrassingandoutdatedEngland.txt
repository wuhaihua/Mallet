Botham and Swann slam 'boring, embarrassing and outdated' England Botham and Swann slam 'boring, embarrassing and outdated' England 
										
		Angry and sad at the way England have&nbsp;been outplayed in the ongoing ODI series against India, former&nbsp;captain Ian Botham and retired spinner Graeme Swann said the&nbsp;performance of the side led by Alastair Cook is nothing short&nbsp;of an "embarrassment".
"Rarely have I been so angry at watching an England&nbsp;cricket team perform. What I saw at Edgbaston was a joke. A&nbsp;total embarrassment from a team who should have designs on&nbsp;winning a World Cup in six months' time," Botham said in his&nbsp;column for 'The Mirror'.
"Instead, they'll be lucky if they win an egg cup between&nbsp;now and then playing like this. They just never learn and it&nbsp;upsets me to see them making the same mistakes time and time&nbsp;again. The one-day game has changed and we have failed to&nbsp;change with it," he added.

Botham's sentiments were echoed by Swann after England&nbsp;lost the fourth ODI by nine wickets here thereby conceding a&nbsp;0-3 lead to India in the five-match series: "It is boring and embarrassing cricket. We haven't caught&nbsp;up with the rest of the world. It is so outdated, outmoded and&nbsp;old fashioned and the whole strategy and outlook must change,"&nbsp;he said.
Botham said England have failed to catch up with the&nbsp;aggression that is required in the shorter formats of the&nbsp;game.
"When are we going to wake up and realise that positive,&nbsp;attacking cricket is what the 50-over game is about, not&nbsp;half-hearted prods to get to 250? There must be players out&nbsp;there who are capable of taking the risks needed to score runs&nbsp;at a faster rate, because this lot certainly aren't," he said.
Swann said England's lack of effort to change according&nbsp;to the present challenge has left him feeling agitated.
"If the England management, captain and selectors cannot&nbsp;see there is a burning issue that needs to be changed, then I&nbsp;am worried, angry and sad," he said.
Former skipper Alec Stewart also felt that England's&nbsp;tactics were outdated.
"We are playing one day cricket as if it is still 1995.&nbsp;We need a change of mindset, game plan and culture."
