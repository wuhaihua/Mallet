			Scotty Cardle believes the time is right to make a major impact on the British lightweight division.The Lytham St Annes man is preparing to battle Kirk Goodings for the English belt in Manchester on September 13, live on Sky Sports.This bout also serves as a British title eliminator, with the winner expected to challenge champion Terry Flanagan, and Cardle has been keeping a close eye on his domestic rivals.The 25-year-old faces the first acid test of his career, but feels well prepared after a run of 15-straight wins."I am going in at the deep end and it is a great challenge," said Cardle."I am looking forward to fighting Goodings. It is for the English title which is a good strap to have and a good belt for my waist. But as a British title eliminator that is what I am really happy with."It is a step-up and that is what I want. I watched Kirk in Sunderland once and became quite a fan of his boxing - I thought he was great - so I am looking forward to fighting him."I have sparred Flanagan before and if all goes according to plan in Manchester then I will get the British title fight before Christmas; I would love that."Cardle's clash with Goodings is part of a busy undercard for Scott Quigg's WBA super-bantamweight title defence against Stephane Jamoye at the Phones 4u Arena.Anthony Crolla will take on tough Mexican Gamaliel Diaz  as he nears a lightweight world title shot, while heavyweight Anthony Joshua will be targeting an eighth straight stoppage win.Sam Eggington faces fellow welterweight Denton Vassell in another British title eliminator, with Gamal Yafai also returning to action on the bill.
