								Federer hits top gear
							
						
					
				
			
			Roger Federer recovered from dropping his first set of the tournament to race into the fourth round of the US Open.The second seed made a slow start in a match interrupted by a thunderstorm but was hugely impressive thereafter in beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 4-6 6-1 6-1 6-1.Federer came into this tournament in superb form and had not been tested in his opening two matches so it was a big surprise when he only won one point in the first three games.At 5-2 to Granollers, the players were taken off because of the threat of lightning and a few minutes later a torrential downpour began.When they returned it was to the odd scene - certainly for Federer - of a virtually empty Arthur Ashe Stadium.Tournament organisers had decided to start the night session prematurely, much to the annoyance of many day session ticket-holders, who were unable to watch the conclusion of the match.Federer looked like he had repaired the damage when he retrieved the break but Granollers played a superb returning game to take the set.The turning point came early in the second set when Federer saved a break point with an ace to avoid trailing 2-0.HappyGranollers did not win another game until he was 3-0 down in the third set, Federer dominating from the back of the court and at the net.There was nothing the Spaniard, ranked 42, could do to turn things back in his favour and Federer clinched victory with his 57th winner after an hour and 58 minutes.The 33-year-old said: "I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good match and I'm happy I was able to come back and turn it around. Marcel started really on fire. The break helped me and I came out and played some great tennis."I felt he was in trouble, also. It's not very often that him and me are tired like this after two hours."Seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov also bounced back from a stuttering start as he toppled David Goffin in four sets.Dimitrov was shut out in the first set as the world No 56 Goffin came storming out of the blocks, howeverÂ the Wimbledon semi-finalist rallied to to win 0-6 6-3 6-4 6-1.Sixth seed Tomas Berdych was a 6-3 6-2 6-4 winner over Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili. He next plays 20-year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem after he defeated Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-2 6-3 to make the fourth round at a grand slam for the first time.
