Nebraska player makes behind-the-back catch Nebraska player makes behind-the-back catch Nebraska handily beat Florida Atlantic 55-7 Saturday, and in the third quarter, sophomore wide receiver Jordan Westerkamp made an absurd grab that&#8217;s already a strong candidate for catch of the year.
			
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
							
					
			
		
		
Westerkamp ran a fade route to the sideline and the pass was tipped by a Florida Atlantic cornerback. Westerkamp, thanks to what could have only been some sort of spider sense or other heightened level of awareness, caught the tipped pass behind his back and kept both feet in bounds.
 
CATCH OF THE YEAR. I&#8217;M CALLING IT.
