Dunn homers in debut with A's, says trade was 'easy decision' Dunn homers in debut with A's, says trade was 'easy decision'  Adam Dunn wasted no time making an impact on the Oakland Athletics' pennant run.
In his first plate appearance with his new team, the former White Sox slugger got just enough of a Chris Young pitch to launch it over the right field wall for a two-run home run against the Seattle Mariners. 
"I didn't hit it very good, but you got to play your elements," Dunn said after the game. "I know the ball travels here pretty good during the day so I'll take it."
Going deep in a debut is nothing new for Dunn as seen by this stat:

Adam Dunn has now homered in his: #Nationals debut (4/6/2009) #WhiteSox debut (4/1/2011) &amp; #Athletics debut (9/1/2014)

The 34-year old designated hitter was dealt from the South Side on Sunday for minor league pitcher Nolan Sanburn after spending four underwhelming years with the White Sox. Dunn, who's never played in a playoff game, waived his no-trade clause when he found out he could be heading to Oakland.

"I got an opportunity to go to the postseason," Dunn said. "It was a very, very easy decision. It's a great team. These opportunities don't come around too often."
Dunn shared his excitement of being with his new team after the game with this tweet: 
 

Wow!!! This is gonna be a heck of a ride. What an atmosphere! @joshreddick16#tooosweeet

Even the switch to an all white jersey with white shoes was something the Texas native embraced.
"I feel really fast in them," Dunn joked. "It'll take some getting used to. Good news is my golf shoes are white so it's not that big of a deal."
