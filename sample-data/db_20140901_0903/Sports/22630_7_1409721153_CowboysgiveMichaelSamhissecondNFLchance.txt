                    Michael Sam has gotten his second chance in the NFL.&nbsp;ESPN&#39;s Adam Schefter reports the rookie defensive end, released by the St. Louis Rams in their final training&nbsp;camp cuts, is getting an opportunity to make the Dallas Cowboys.

IYER: Why Cowboys were Sam&#39;s best (only?) post-Rams NFL option

Sam will undergo a physical for the Cowboys on Wednesday. According to the NFL Network&#39;s Ian Rapoport, they&#39;ve &quot;done their research and due diligence&quot; and their&nbsp;plan is to assign Sam to their practice squad&nbsp;assuming he passes the physical.

Sam was a seventh-round pick of the Rams in the 2014 draft down the road from the University of Missouri. The Rams&nbsp;chose to not sign Sam&nbsp;to their&nbsp;practice squad after undrafted rookie Ethan Westbrooks made St. Louis&#39; 53-man roster over Sam.

The Cowboys are thin on pass-rushing talent at 4-3 defensive end after not bringing back either Jasoh Hatcher and&nbsp;DeMarcus Ware in the offseason. Their best rookie end, DeMarcus Lawrence,&nbsp;is on the shelf eight to&nbsp;12 weeks with a broken foot. It made perfect sense for them to get a closer look at Sam.

HAISLOP: Sam can, will play in the NFL this season

Sam had 11 tackles and three sacks in four preseason games. He was impressive, and Rams coach Jeff Fisher said he was rooting for Sam. But in St. Louis, it came down to a numbers game &mdash; the Rams simply had more depth at&nbsp;defensive line&nbsp;then just about any team in the league. Sam did his part, but there wasn&#39;t enough room for him.

The Cowboys will now see if he&#39;s a fit in Dallas.&nbsp;
