Farrell: Jackie Bradley Jr. a 'work in progress' Farrell: Jackie Bradley Jr. a 'work in progress' September 2, 2014, 7:15 pm NEW YORK -- When Jackie Bradley Jr. was optioned to Pawtucket last month, Farrell vowed that Bradley would return to the parent club in September.
The fact that Bradley has continued to struggle mightily, even in the minors, doesn't alter that plan.
"Nothing has changed in that way,'' said Farrell.
Bradley has a slash line of .212/.246/.273 in 14 games with the Pawsox.
"Jackie was well aware when we sat down and described what was to be the focal point (to work on),'' said Farrell. "The reports have been mixed. There's days when he's executing in between the lines, as he's been working on (things). But it's still a work in progress.''
