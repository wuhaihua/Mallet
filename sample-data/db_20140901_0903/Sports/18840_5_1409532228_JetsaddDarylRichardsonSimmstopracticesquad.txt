Two of the players who were added on Sunday were among the teams final cuts &mdash; quarterback Matt Simms and former St. Louis Rams running back Daryl Richardson. Along with the additions of Richardson and Simms, the Jets added defensive tackle Tevita Finau, defensive lineman Kerry Hyder, safety Rontez Miles, tight end Chris Pantale and offensive tackle Brett Qvale to the practice squad. The signings bring the Jets practice squad roster to seven players. With the new practice squad rules, teams can have up to ten players on the practice squad so the Jets have three spots remaining.
