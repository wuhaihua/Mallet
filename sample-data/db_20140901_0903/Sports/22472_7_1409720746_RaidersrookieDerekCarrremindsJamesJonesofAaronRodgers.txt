                    Wide receiver James Jones knows a thing or two about elite quarterback play having played with Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay for six years.&nbsp;

Now in Oakland, Jones thinks his new starting quarterback, rookie Derek Carr, displays Rodgers-like qualities.

&nbsp;| 

&quot;He&rsquo;s really calm, really cool in the pocket,&quot;&nbsp;Jones told SFGate.com on Tuesday. &quot;He acts like he&rsquo;s been there before. I&rsquo;ve been calling him mini A-Rod since he got here.&quot;

The Raiders meanwhile don&#39;t really know much about elite quarterback play, but they do know about rookies&nbsp;&mdash; Oakland in&nbsp;recent years has been a revolving door of young talent with no results.&nbsp;

&quot;He&rsquo;s not your typical rookie,&quot; center Stefen Wisniewski told the site on the first day of camp when Carr arrived with knowledge of all offensive calls. &quot;He understands defenses at a very advanced level more than most rookies would. I think Derek gets way more prepared than most rookies would be.&quot;
