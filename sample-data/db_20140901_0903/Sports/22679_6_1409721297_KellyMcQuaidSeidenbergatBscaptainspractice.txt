Adam McQuaid (ankle surgery), Chris Kelly (back surgery) and Dennis Seidenberg (right knee surgery) all had last season end with injury, but looked fit and strong among the 21 skaters at the informal B’s practice session organized and run by Patrice Bergeron.McQuaid missed Boston’s last 34 regular season games and all 12 playoff games with several lower body injuries, and finally succumbed to ankle surgery in May that prematurely ended his season. Kelly waited until after the playoffs were over to have surgery on a herniated disc that forced him to miss Boston’s entire playoff run.Seidenberg blew out his right knee back in December, and was healthy enough to be able to return to play if the Bruins had qualified for the Eastern Conference Finals last spring.Included among the B’s participants were Bergeron, McQuaid, Kelly, Seidenberg, Daniel Paille, Loui Eriksson and Tuukka Rask along with prospective B’s skaters in Justin Florek, Bobby Robins, David Warsofsky and David Pastrnak. There were a number of non-Bruins personnel skating with the team as well.Shawn Thornton was decked out head to toe in Florida Panthers gear skating with his former teammates, and former B’s defenseman Hal Gill and Phoenix Coyotes D-man Keith Yandle also took part in the session before departing for their NHL cities.
