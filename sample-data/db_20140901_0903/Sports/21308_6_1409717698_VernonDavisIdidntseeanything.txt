Vernon Davis: 'I didn't see anything' Vernon Davis: 'I didn't see anything'  SANTA CLARA -- Tight end Vernon Davis was in attendance at Ray McDonald’s party in the early hours Sunday morning when San Jose Police arrived.
But Davis said he was not a witness to what transpired between McDonald and his fiancé, resulting in McDonald’s arrest on domestic violence charges.
“I didn’t see anything, I didn’t hear anything.,” Davis said Tuesday. “I don’t know what went on over there. I wish I could put my finger on it, but I don’t know. All I do know is Ray is a great guy. He’s awesome.
“He’s got great character. Everyone on the team knows that. He’s a guy of good integrity, great character, hard worker, good player, comes to work each and every day.”
McDonald was not made available to the media on Tuesday in the 49ers’ locker room at Levi's Stadium.
Upon posting $25,000 bail and being released from Santa Clara County Jail on Sunday, McDonald said it was a “crazy situation.”
“I can’t say too much right now,” McDonald said. “The truth will come out. Everybody knows what kind of person I am ... good-hearted person.”
Davis said a “big number” of 49ers players attended McDonald’s birthday party out of support for him. McDonald turned 30 on Tuesday. Davis said he didn’t know if it was “half or 75 percent” of the team that were there.
“I was actually leaving, on my way out,” Davis said. “I saw cops around. As far as what went on, I don’t really know.”
Davis posted a photo on his Instagram account earlier in the evening. Later, he deleted the photo that was taken at McDonald's party.
“Having a good time, just enjoying the team,” Davis said. “That's what I posted on my Instagram. Relaxing, enjoying the team.
“Took it down, just because -- just because.”
