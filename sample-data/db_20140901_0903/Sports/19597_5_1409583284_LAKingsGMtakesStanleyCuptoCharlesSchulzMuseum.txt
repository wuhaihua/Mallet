LA Kings GM takes Stanley Cup to Charles Schulz Museum LA Kings GM takes Stanley Cup to Charles Schulz Museum Jun 16, 2014; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Los Angeles Kings general manager Dean Lombardi speaks a rally to celebrate winning the 2014 Stanley Cup at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsNHL    The Los Angeles Kings are on the home stretch of a summer that&rsquo;s seen each member of the organization celebrate their championship by spending a day with the Stanley Cup, per NHL tradition. They get to do whatever they want with the Stanley Cup on that day (within reason of course, but that reason has been stretched considerably thin in the past). General manager Dean Lombardi decided to get creative with his Cup visit &mdash; his second in the last three years.  Charles Schulz, the late creator of Peanuts, was an avid hockey fan and that fact wasn&rsquo;t lost on Lombardi, who took the Cup down to the museum bearing Schulz&rsquo;s name, per the Los Angeles Times. What resulted was some pretty fantastic pictures. @LAKings GM Dean Lombardi receives some advice for the upcoming season. @NHL@HockeyHallFame#stanleycuppic.twitter.com/KNUlqcG8MK &mdash; Philip Pritchard (@keeperofthecup) August 31, 2014 &ldquo;Hang on Snoopy, Snoopy hang on&rdquo; #Snoopyshomeice.

It appears Lombardi is equally a fan of Schulz. In bringing the Cup to his museum, he has made a great tribute to the legendary career of Charles Schulz.
