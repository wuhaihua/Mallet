The 49ers on Saturday reworked the contract of defensive end Ray McDonald to lower his salary-cap number by $2.11 million for the upcoming season, a source confirmed.
McDonald, who was scheduled to earn $3.5 million in base salary, saw his salary reduced to the minimum of $855,000 and received a signing bonus of $2.645 million.
In addition, two voidable years were added to McDonald’s contract to spread out the hit on the salary cap. McDonald, who is still in essence is signed through 2016, had his salary-cap figure drop from $5.346 million to $3.23 million for the 2014 season.
On Sunday morning, McDonald was taken into custody by San Jose Police on felony domestic violence charges. He posted $25,000 bail and was released later that morning.
