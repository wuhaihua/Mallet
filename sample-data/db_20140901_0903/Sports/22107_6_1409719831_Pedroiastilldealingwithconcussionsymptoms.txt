Pedroia still dealing with concussion symptoms Pedroia still dealing with concussion symptoms September 2, 2014, 7:15 pm NEW YORK -- Dustin Pedroia, as predicted, remained out of the lineup for the third straight game, with no sign that he will see action before the Red Sox return home at the end of the week.
Pedroia suffered a concussion Saturday night at Tropicana Field when he collided with Tampa Bay infielder Logan Forsythe, absorbing a forearm to the left side of his head.
"He's still dealing with some of the symptoms,'' said Pedroia. "(Monday) when he tried some activity, he didn't feel quite right. It's hard for me to categorize specifically what he's feeling. There are some inconsistencies with his sleep. These are symptoms that are consistent with a concussion and we've got to be cautious with this and go day-to-day.''
Pedroia took some batting practice in the indoor cage Monday at Tropicana Field but felt some dizziness and stopped the activity.
