Gomez has sprained wrist, could miss several weeks Gomez has sprained wrist, could miss several weeks Jake Roth-USA TODAY SportsMLB    The Milwaukee Brewers find themselves in a tough spot in the playoff picture as the 2014 season winds down. It certainly is not the time for them to be without their best player, but that is exactly the situation facing them with the news on Tuesday that Carlos Gomez has been diagnosed with a sprained left wrist.  According to Daniel Kramer of MLB.com, the injury could keep Gomez out for several weeks: Outfielder Carlos Gomez has been diagnosed with a sprained left wrist, and the All-Star could be out of the lineup multiple weeks, manager Ron Roenicke said. The Brewers were informed the extent of the injury after Gomez met with head team physician Dr. William Raasch, who indicated there is no structural damage to the wrist. Roenicke said Gomez won&rsquo;t resume physical activity until at least Sunday, one week after sustaining the sprain during the third inning of a 15-5 loss in San Francisco. From there, Gomez will begin light swinging and slowly work his way back into late-game scenarios, pinch-running or as a defensive substitution. There is&nbsp;just a hair under three weeks left in the 2014 regular season; an injury that keeps Gomez out for multiple weeks could be one that keeps him out for the remainder of the season. With the Cardinals having just caught and passed the Brewers for first place, this news truly could not come at a worse time in Milwaukee. Gomez is batting .282/.348/.479 with 21 home runs and 65 RBI this season, good for 3.7 wins above replacement (WAR).
