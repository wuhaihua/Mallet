Jets' Rex Ryan: 'I have skin like an armadillo' Jets' Rex Ryan: 'I have skin like an armadillo' Aug 28, 2014; Philadelphia, PA, USA; New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan smiles on the sidelines during a game against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles won 37-7. Mandatory Credit: Derik Hamilton-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Rex Ryan is a defensive mastermind. In his five years with&nbsp;the New York Jets,&nbsp;he has proven that. It&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s&nbsp;not a defensive coordinator, he&rsquo;s the head coach, of course. And he hasn&rsquo;t exactly proven himself to be an offensive guru. One effort to combat the willing Jet&rsquo;s offense was Stephen Hill. The Jets&rsquo; selected Hill in the second round of the 2012 draft. Thus far, he has been a bust. But Hill&rsquo;s agent said that Ryan was a big part of&nbsp;Hill&rsquo;s failures thus far.&nbsp;Ryan responded to that criticism on Monday.  &ldquo;I have skin like an armadillo,&rdquo; Ryan said, and added that Hill&rsquo;s agent is entitled to his own opinion. The criticism was as follows: &ldquo;He&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t have a chance&nbsp;that first year with that whole Tim Tebow-Mark Sanchez&nbsp;fiasco,&rdquo; Herman said, via&nbsp;USA Today. &ldquo;His second year,&nbsp;Geno Smith&nbsp;was learning how to play quarterback. So they never threw the ball deep because they wanted to simplify things for Geno.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not necessary an attack on Rex Ryan and the Jets&rsquo; as it is an excuse for the disappearance and lack of emergence of Stephen Hill. So Ryan may not need that armadillo skin after all. Hill&rsquo;s agent thought the Cleveland Browns might be interested, but Hill is still a free agent. The Carolina Panthers have also shown interested by working out Hill, but nothing official has come of it.
