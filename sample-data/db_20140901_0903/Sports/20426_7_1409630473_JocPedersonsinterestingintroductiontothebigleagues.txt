                    Joc Pederson failed in his major league debut Monday night, but the Dodgers stud prospect may have&nbsp;already gained a measure of respect.

Representing the winning run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth&nbsp;against the Nationals, he&nbsp;got a full-count slider from Washington closer&nbsp;Rafael Soriano. Pederson took it and&nbsp;tried to sell it as Ball 4, but the pitch clearly was a strike. Game over: Nats win, 6-4.



Still, a breaking ball on 3-2 to a rookie&nbsp;with the game on the line, even if Soriano throws his slider a lot (28.4 percent, according to Fangraphs)? Maybe that&#39;s because earlier in the at-bat,&nbsp;Pederson drilled a pitch&nbsp;foul into the right-field box seats. Soriano and catcher Wilson Ramos took notice.

Pederson can expect similar tough pitching during his September call-up. The 22-year-old&#39;s reputation precedes him; he had&nbsp;a huge season at Triple-A Albuquerque with&nbsp;33 home runs, 30 stolen bases and a 1.017 OPS. The 30-30 feat was the first in the Pacific Coast League in 80 years.
