Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon injured hip in loss to LSU Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon injured hip in loss to LSU Aug 30, 2014; Houston, TX, USA; Wisconsin Badgers running back Melvin Gordon (25) rushes during the first quarter against the LSU Tigers at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    If you were watching Saturday night&rsquo;s game between the LSU Tigers and Wisconsin Badgers and wondering why star running back Melvin Gordon was not in the game in the second half, now you have an answer.  Gordon said on Monday that he suffered a minor hip injury on his final carry in the first half and Wisconsin held him back in the second half for precautionary reasons. Wisconsin head coach Gary Andersen said Monday that Gordon&rsquo;s had a minor hip flexor and that they &ldquo;were trying to be smart with him as the rest of the game went on.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t look too banged up when he ran 63 yards on his first carry in the second half to set up a touchdown as the Badgers went up 24-7, but he only touched the ball three more times after that for a total of three yards as Wisconsin lost 28-27. Gordon finished with 138 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, but his lack of action in the second half opened the door for LSU to come from behind and take the win away from Wisconsin who looked to be rolling with Gordon in the backfield. The hip injury that limited him in the second half on Saturday should not hinder him on Saturday against Western Illinois as he said he is &ldquo;healthy and ready to roll for Saturday.&rdquo; However, he may not get much action in the second half against the FCS opponent, but this would be for a good reason as Wisconsin could have a sizable lead and Gordon could have more than 150 yards and that point.
