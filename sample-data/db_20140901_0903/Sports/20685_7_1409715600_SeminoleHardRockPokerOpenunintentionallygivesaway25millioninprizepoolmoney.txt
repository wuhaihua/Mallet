                    Overlays are a reality in poker tournaments which have a guaranteed prize pool. Sometimes, an event fails to attract an anticipated number of entrants, leaving the host casino with the burden of ponying-up the extra funds.

That is exactly what is transpiring this week at the Seminole Hard Rock Poker Open Championship Event. Despite promotional assistance from the PokerStars&rsquo; and its Live Stream services, the $10 million overall guarantee fell short by&hellip; $2.5 million!



A total of 1,499 entered this year&rsquo;s $5,300 Main Event. With $300 of the entry fee earmarked as rake, the total funds collected for prize pool add up to roughly $7.5 million leaving a $2.5 million windfall for players. Last year, the same event boasted a player pool of nearly 2,400, for a prize pool of $12 million.

Although the event represents a serious added value for those who entered, it will inevitably force the tournament&rsquo;s organizers to rethink the guaranteed funds for next year&rsquo;s championship event.



If we divide the $10 million prize pool for the SHRPO Championship by 1,499 (the number of entries), the end result is roughly $6,671&mdash;meaning each player who entered received an added equity of $1,671.

Few if any large buy-in tournaments in the history of poker have offered such an enormous overlay to players. A few months ago, an error by a PokerStars.com employee who forgot to &ldquo;push a button&rdquo; to allow late registration resulted $260,000 overlay for those who entered the $200+15, $500,000 guaranteed online event.

Both the International Stadiums Poker Tour Wembley and the Partouche Poker Tour Main Events in 2013 and 2012 were forced to pitch in a significant amount of extra funds to meet overblown guaranteed prize pools.
