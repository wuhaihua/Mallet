                    LINCOLN, Neb.&nbsp;&mdash; Nebraska defensive end Randy Gregory is doubtful for this week&#39;s game against McNeese State because of a knee injury, putting junior Jack Gangwish in line for his first start.

Gregory, who led the Big Ten in sacks last season, left the Florida Atlantic game after the Cornhuskers&#39; first defensive series Saturday. Coach Bo Pelini said Monday that Gregory had a basketball injury from several years ago &quot;flare up,&quot; and it caused a clicking sensation in his knee.

Gregory underwent a procedure Sunday to remove scar tissue.

&quot;It was a non-contact injury,&quot; Pelini said. &quot;The doctors could tell from looking at the MRI that it was very old.&quot;

Pelini said Gregory probably could play against McNeese State, if needed. It&#39;s more likely he&#39;ll return for the Sept. 13 game at Fresno State.

&quot;We&#39;re not looking to rush him back right now,&quot; Pelini said. &quot;Make sure he&#39;s 100 percent, feels good, and when that time frame is, we&#39;ll see.&quot;

Gangwish had never played in a game until he took over for Gregory on Saturday. He was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hurry.

&quot;Jack did some good things,&quot; Pelini said. &quot;He did some things that he would want back and that we would want back. But he played hard. I think Jack is going to help us. He&#39;s getting better.&quot;

Gangwish said starting this week would be a dream come true for a kid who grew up in Wood River, Nebraska. He walked on in 2011 and found out last week that he would be put on scholarship this fall.

&#39;&#39;Coming in, I was hoping to be a guy that could contribute on special teams and maybe back up a position, but I really didn&#39;t ever even think that I&#39;d have an opportunity to start a game,&quot; Gangwish said. &quot;So if I get the start on Saturday, for me that&#39;s pretty incredible. That&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t expect.&quot;
