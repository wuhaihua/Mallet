                    BILBAO, Spain &mdash; Kenneth Faried scored 22 points and the U.S. rebounded from a rare deficit at halftime to beat Turkey 98-77 on Sunday in the Basketball World Cup. Anthony Davis finished with 19 points, all in the second half.

A night after beating Finland by 59 in its biggest rout while using NBA players in the former world championship, the Americans couldn&#39;t take control against Turkey until early in the fourth quarter.

They trailed 40-35 at halftime. Turkey led by six early in the third before the Americans could get the game into the quicker tempo they prefer and pull away to win the rematch of the 2010 gold-medal game in Istanbul.

But it was a much tougher one than expected after the Americans hammered Finland 114-55 while Turkey was being outplayed for most of its opener by New Zealand before pulling out the victory.
