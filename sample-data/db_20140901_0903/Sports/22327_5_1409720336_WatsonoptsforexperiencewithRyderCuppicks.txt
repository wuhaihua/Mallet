Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY SportsGolf    U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson opted for experience on Tuesday when he finalized his roster for the semiannual international competition to be held Sept. 23-28 at Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland. Watson named three Ryder Cup veterans as his captain&rsquo;s picks, selecting Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson. Bradley and Mahan were expected to be named, but Simpson was a late decision by Watson. &ldquo;It really came to me this morning,&rdquo; Watson told the Golf Channel (per CBSSports.com). &ldquo;I kind of had a revelation this morning.&rdquo; There was some thought that Watson might take Chris Kirk after his win over the weekend at the Deutsche Bank Championship. &ldquo;He took it like a man,&rdquo; Watson said. &ldquo;I have a fundamental belief in our team.&rdquo;  Bradley was 3-1-0 for the U.S. in 2012, Mahan went 3-2-3 in 2008 and 2010 and Simpson was 2-2-0 with the 2012 team. The three captain&rsquo;s picks join the nine automatic selections that were determined by points accumulated through the PGA Championship last month. The nine automatic picks were Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed and Zach Johnson. Bradley was 13th on the points list, Simpson finished 15th and Mahan was 25th.
