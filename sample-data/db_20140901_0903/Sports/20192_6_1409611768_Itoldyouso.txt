I told you so! I told you so! September 1, 2014, 6:00 pm Can I say, “I TOLD YOU SO?”
No?
I will anyway.
I told you Ryan Mallett would be cut. I know, I know; technically, he was traded for a conditional seventh-round pick. But come on. That's the same as getting a visit from the Turk.
Jimmy Garoppolo played better in four weeks than Ryan Mallet played in four years. And you could tell what was coming from the body language of Bill Belichick.  Whenever he talked with Jimmy G. on the sideline, you could see him  blushing and beaming with adoration.  Hey, he even put his right hand on Jimmy G’s hip. That public display of affection was a sure sign that the relationship was ready to move to the next level. And it has.
Can I give you another, “I TOLD YO SO?”
No? 
I will anyway.
A statement by Jackie Macmullen, not for air, has us talking about the trading of Rajon Rondo.
I told you a long time ago Rondo’s days in green were numbered. I do think he wants out of Boston, and why wouldn’t he? The Celtics couldn't get Kevin Love, and Carmelo returned to the Knicks. Why would Rajon want to stay? If I were him, I'd demand a trade.
The Celtics have no choice but to trade him because Rondo will bolt when he becomes a free agent. The problem is, Rondo’s value isn't what it used to be . . . or what Celtics fans think it is. He's coming off an ACL injury, he's in his contract year, and he has the reputation of having a bad attitude. Not to mention he is a so-so shooter and struggles at the foul line. The best the Celtics can hope for is for Rondo to play lights out this season before they trade him by the February deadline.
I don’t get to say, “I told you so” often, so thank you for humoring me. Even though really you really didn’t want to hear it in the first place.
