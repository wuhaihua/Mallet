Report: Chelsea offer up GK Petr Cech to Queens Park Rangers Report: Chelsea offer up GK Petr Cech to Queens Park Rangers    Queens Park Rangers haven&rsquo;t had the type of start they were hoping for upon a return to the English Premier League. It has led manager Harry Redknapp to reportedly be scrambling to strengthen the squad in hopes of staying up in the EPL beyond this season.  One of QPR&rsquo;s potential signings is a familiar name to many in London, as The Daily Mail is reporting Chelsea are offering up goalkeeper Petr Cech on a transfer deal. Cech&rsquo;s place in the Chelsea squad had not been in question over the past few years, but with&nbsp;Thibaut Courtois coming back to the club after a loan spell to Atletico Madrid, Cech has been out of favor with manager Jose Mourinho.&nbsp; QPR have an interesting goalkeeper situation of their own, with former English international Robert Green in net currently. However, adding a 32-year-old Cech to the fold would strengthen a shaky defense almost from the moment a potential signing would happen. Cech commands his box better than just about any keeper in the EPL, and his communication with defenders could be a huge help to a team struggling to keep the opposition> Through three weeks of the EPL season, QPR have let in five goals and scored just one. It lost 1-0 to Hull to open the season, then went to White Hart Lane and lost 4-0 before finding the net for the first time this season in a 1-0 win over Sunderland this past weekend. Sitting on three points has QPR 12th in the EPL table, but far from secure in its position> Adding Cech would help turn that around, but you have to wonder if Chelsea will be keen to see Cech on another EPL squad. Cech isn&rsquo;t the only rumored signing for QPR though, as Alex McCarthy is rumored to be moving to the &lsquo;Gers from Reading and there have been rumors of a move for Jermaine Defoe from Toronto FC in MLS and other crazy moves.
