They will have seven cornerbacks and five safeties, for now. That&rsquo;s a small army of defensive backs. But for Browns head coach Mike Pettine, it&rsquo;s about the quality of players, not the quantity. He needs every one of them.  &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s probably a little bit of both,&rdquo; Pettine said, via ESPN.com. &ldquo;We felt that these guys are talented NFL corners that were worthy of being on the roster.
