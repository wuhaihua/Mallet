                    HAMPTON, Ga. &mdash; Tony Stewart made his return to Sprint Cup racing Sunday night, and while it didn&rsquo;t go as he hoped, at least he was able to feel competitive for a short while at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

Stewart, who started 12th in the Oral-B 500, quickly moved into the top 10 and briefly ran in the top five before his car began to lose handling on his second run of the day, costing him several spots. That eventually led to a blown right front tire and an early exit after just 170 laps of 325 laps.



He ended up 41st out of 43 drivers that took the green. He left the track without comment after missing the last three races following the Aug. 9 accident where Stewart&rsquo;s sprint car struck and killed 20-year-old driver Kevin Ward Jr.

&ldquo;We all look at him to lead this and to guide us, and it was good to have him back,&rdquo; Stewart crew chief Chad Johnston said. &ldquo;We look forward to having him the rest of the year and getting him to victory lane.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very disappointing. His first week back, we were hoping for bigger things. We qualified well and had good speed in practice and had good speed at the beginning of the race and definitely not the outcome we were looking for.&rdquo;

Running 12th on a Lap-122 restart, Stewart got pinched into the wall by Kyle Busch. Stewart&rsquo;s car had cosmetic damage and the steering wheel was knocked off kilter by an inch.

&ldquo;We just got run over bigtime,&rdquo; Stewart told his team on their in-car radio.

In less than 40 laps, Stewart&rsquo;s car became incredibly tight and he was lapped after 10 more laps. Stewart then blew a right front tire, sending him to the wall and damaging the car beyond repair.

&ldquo;We drove up into the top five and thought we had a pretty good chance,&rdquo; Johnston said. &ldquo;We were just kind of biding our time taking care of our stuff and got into an incident there off of (Turn) 2 and knocked the toe out of it and had some pretty heavy right-side damage and ended up blowing a right front.&rdquo;

Even though he didn&rsquo;t make it to the finish, Stewart still just needed to get through the day. His last time in a racecar ended in tragedy, as Ward approached his car on foot following a wreck and Stewart&rsquo;s car struck him in an Empire Super Sprints event at Canandaigua (N.Y.) Motorsports Park. Ward was pronounced dead 45 minutes later.

Stewart addressed the Ward family while emotionally reading a statement Friday and then tried to go about his weekend. At the driver&rsquo;s meeting Sunday afternoon, Jeff Gordon put his arm around Stewart and talked to him on the way out.

At his car prior to the race, Stewart was hugged by executives by two of his car sponsors &mdash; Johnny Morris of Bass Pro Shops and Rusty Rush of Rush Truck Stops. About seven television crews and several photographers were around his car, but Stewart seemed able to ignore the spotlight and chatted with his crew and well-wishers.

The team had a prerace prayer, and Stewart addressed them on his radio just prior to the green flag.

&ldquo;Guys, be careful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be safe down there. I appreciate everything.&rdquo;

The team appreciated having the 43-year-old three-time Cup champion, who has 48 career wins, back in the car.

&ldquo;&ldquo;It was awesome,&quot; Johnston said. &ldquo;It was like he was never gone. We didn&rsquo;t skip a beat. He hopped in and had speed right off the beginning. &hellip; He&rsquo;s a champion, and that&rsquo;s what true champions do.

&quot;He proved that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a champion and he&rsquo;ll be a champion again.&quot;

Stewart, who is winless this year, didn&rsquo;t say much on the radio after pulling it into the garage. He has one shot left to make NASCAR&rsquo;s Chase for the Sprint Cup but will need to win next Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway.

&ldquo;We thought we had a shot of winning. &hellip; We&rsquo;ll just have to lick our wounds and go to Richmond and see if we can do it there, and if so, it will be pretty exciting,&rdquo; Johnston said.
