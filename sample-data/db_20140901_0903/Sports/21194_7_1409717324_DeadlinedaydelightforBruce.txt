			Steve Bruce says Hull City 'got what we wanted' on a productive deadline day at the end of a busy summer window.With transfer business shut down in the Premier League until the New Year, Bruce can look back with pride at what he has been able to achieve.He has spent big, breaking the club’s transfer record in the process, but has welcomed 11 additions into his ranks.Some of those have been familiar faces, such as Jake Livermore, and some deals were wrapped up well before a final flurry of activity, such as Tom Ince, Robert Snodgrass and Michael Dawson.Hull were, however, to be the big movers on Monday, with Abel Hernandez joining for around £10million, Mohamed Diame for £3.5m and Gaston Ramirez and Hatem Ben Arfa arriving on season-long loan deals.In all, Bruce splashed out £36.25 million on reshaping a squad that he hopes can now consolidate in the top flight and push on into the top-half of the table.He has addressed issues from back to front, with steel added down the spine of the side as well as a considerable goal threat from creativity on the flanks and proven marksmen down the middle.Bruce told Sky Sports News HQ on his deadline day dealings: “On paper there are some really, really good signings we’ve made today.“I think what summed the day up was when I rang Ben Arfa to see where he was and he was stuck in York, and you’re thinking ‘What’s he doing in York?’ That was a bit fraught, but overall we’re delighted with what we’ve done.“We’ve managed to bring what seems like four players on the day, but two or three of them have had a week’s work gone into them.“We got what we wanted.”
