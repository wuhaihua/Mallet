Saina to train under former coach Vimal Kumar in run up to Asian Games Saina to train under former coach Vimal Kumar in run up to Asian Games 
										
		Saina Nehwal has demanded to train with former coach Vimal Kumar ahead of the Asian Games &mdash; and her current coach Pullela Gopichand has given her the go ahead.
According to a report in The Times of India, Saina has decided to move to Bangalore to train after informing Gopichand of her decision during the World Championships in Denmark.

"Yes, I am going to Bangalore tomorrow. I want to train with Vimal Kumar Sir. His tips during the Uber Cup were quite helpful. But after the Asian Games I will come back here. I just want to try and train with him. I hope it will be helpful for me. I told Gopi Sir during the World Championships and he said OK," Saina is quoted as saying in the report &mdash; which also mentions sources as saying that a loss of form convinced the 24-year-old to rethink her coaching options.
It's still a mystery whether there is a long-term arrangement in place for Saina to train under Kumar even after the Asiad &mdash; but as of now, it's only a 15-day stint in the run-up to the tournament in Incheon.
Saina had opted for a similar change of coach in 2011 when she went to train under Baskar Babu &mdash; but that lasted for only three months before she returned to Hyderabad under the tutelage of Gopichand.
