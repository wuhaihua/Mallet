Kanye West performs at Made In America Festival (Video) Kanye West performs at Made In America Festival (Video) Entertainment    Over the weekend, rapper Kanye West performed at the Made In America music festival. It was an event held on both coasts, with part taking place in Philadelphia and the other being hosted in Los Angeles. West performed in both cities, and video of his performance in Philadelphia was uploaded to Mr World Premiere TV. For as crazy and annoying as West can be sometimes, there is no denying his musical talent and the fact that he is a remarkable live performer. In the vide you see a toned down set from West, who doesn&rsquo;t carry all the theatrics of a Kanye West concert into the festival, but you would barely notice. Festival performers also usually have tighter time restrictions and are on a pretty locked schedule as well. And yes, it does include a patented Kanye West rant against the media.   Here is the set list: Black Skinhead I Don&rsquo;t Like (Chief Keef cover) Mercy Cold Can&rsquo;t Tell Me Nothing New Slaves Power Blood on the Leaves Stronger Runaway Run This Town (JAY Z cover) Diamonds from Sierra Leone Heartless Jesus Walks All Falls Down Touch the Sky All of the Lights Good Life Bound 2 Encore: Blood on the Leaves (Reprise) [h/t] Mr World Premiere TV, Has It Leaked, Rhyme Junkie
