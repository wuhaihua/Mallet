Mosley critical of Mercedes publicly blaming Rosberg Mosley critical of Mercedes publicly blaming Rosberg 
Former FIA president Max Mosley has criticised Mercedes for publicly blaming Nico Rosberg in the wake of his clash with team-mate Lewis Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix.
The team released a statement following a crisis meeting last Friday in which they stated that Rosberg&nbsp;"acknowledged his responsibility" and that "suitable disciplinary measures" had been taken.
The Briton agreed that the German should have been punished for his actions, but doesn't believe it should have been made public.
"In every respect but one I think Mercedes dealt with the incident in the right way," he told the Daily Mail. "If they decided to fine or punish Rosberg they should not have announced it. It's as if the team are blaming him publicly. That's not really right."
Mosley isn't one to shy away from controversy and was at the helm of the FIA throughout many difficult times, including that of the 'Spygate' scandal. Many have suggested the stewards, under his control, would have investigated Rosberg, but he disagrees and has backed them for classing it a 'racing incident'.
"The way I see it, and I'm on the outside now, is that the very experienced race director [Charlie Whiting] and the stewards decided not to act because it was a 'racing incident'. That was more or less that. It was a minor incident with serious consequences. What the drivers did or not say afterwards is not clear. On that basis the FIA could not get involved.
"It's then a matter for the team. A lot goes on behind closed doors. What is unusual is announcing it. Personally, I wouldn't have done that.'"
