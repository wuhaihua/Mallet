Talking Points: Rays 4, Red Sox 3 Talking Points: Rays 4, Red Sox 3 September 1, 2014, 5:30 pm ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The talking points of the Red Sox' 4-3, 10-inning loss to the Rays on Monday:
STAR OF THE GAME: Matt JoyceJoyce had had a rough afternoon in first four plate appearances: Two strikeouts, a flyout and a fielder's choice. But when it counted most for the Rays, he came through. In the bottom of the 10th, with the bases loaded, he launched a single to left over the head of outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, producing a walk-off victory for the Rays.
HONORABLE MENTION: Evan LongoriaLongoria is having a subpar season but always seems to come up big against the Sox. It was no different Monday, as he delivered a two-run single in the third inning, giving Tampa a 3-1 lead at the time.
GOAT OF THE GAME: Jemile WeeksIt's impossible to know what would have followed, but Weeks made a most inauspicious debut for the Sox. He entered the game in the top of the 10th inning as a pinch-runner, representing the potential go-ahead run in a tie game. In no time, however, was caught leaning the wrong way, picked off by Grant Balfour.
TURNING POINTIn the fifth inning, the Sox got a one-out double from Xander Bogaerts, but the shortstop got greedy and was thrown out trying to steal third base. That was the last baserunner in scoring position until the eighth inning.
BY THE NUMBERSYoenis Cespedes produced an RBI single in the eighth, giving him 23 RBI in 28 games with the Red Sox.
