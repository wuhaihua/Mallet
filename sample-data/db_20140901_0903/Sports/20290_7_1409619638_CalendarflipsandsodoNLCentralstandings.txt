                    ST. LOUIS &mdash; For the first time since early April, the Brewers are no longer in first place in the NL Central. They&rsquo;ve been usurped by a team that, just a couple days ago, was trying to figure out how in the world they would stop a four-game losing streak.&nbsp;

Such is September baseball.



Milwaukee lost again on Monday, for the sixth time in a row since starting their current road trip with a win at San Diego. The 4-2 loss to the Cubs at Wrigley Field, combined with St. Louis&rsquo; come-from-behind 5-4 win at home against the Pirates, moved the Cardinals a game up on the Brewers.&nbsp;

St. Louis&rsquo; four-game skid ended on Saturday afternoon, but it feels like a lot longer ago than that for the Cardinals.&nbsp;

&ldquo;Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you can see it in the clubhouse,&rdquo; said Cardinals rookie Kolten Wong, whose two-run, pinch-hit home run in the seventh tied the game. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s just a little more loose, having a little more fun. We&rsquo;re just going out there and playing, and whatever else happens, happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;

If Matt Holliday continues his hot streak, St. Louis should like what happens. In the Cardinals&rsquo; past three contests, Holliday has three home runs, 12 RBIs and a .636 average.&nbsp;

That&rsquo;s, um, pretty OK.&nbsp;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m OK with him just going off all month long and just doing what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; Cardinals starter Lance Lynn said with a smile.&nbsp;

The division could have been a little crazier, had the Pirates held onto the 3-0 lead they built after two innings Monday. Had the Pirates topped the Cardinals, the Brewers and Cards would have been tied for first, with Pittsburgh a single game back. As it stands now, the Cardinals are in first, a game ahead of the Brewers and three up on the Pirates.&nbsp;

There&rsquo;s plenty of time for chaos to reign, though. The Cardinals have two more against the Pirates in this series and seven more games against Milwaukee this month. The Brewers and Pirates play a three-game set Sept. 19-21, and all three of those teams face the youth-infused Cubs and feisty Reds multiple times down the stretch.&nbsp;

&ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;re in first place, it means a lot, especially this time of year,&rdquo; Lynn said. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s all said and done, we want to be in first place at the end of the month. We&rsquo;re in there at the first of the month, hopefully we&rsquo;ll be there the end of the month.&rdquo;
