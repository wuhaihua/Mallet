								Hernandez set for Real loan
							
						
					
				
			
			Manchester United and Real Madrid have agreed a season-long loan deal for striker Javier Hernandez which is expected to be completed on Monday, according to Sky Sportsâ€™ Spanish football expert Guillem Balague.The Mexico international has grown increasingly frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities at Old Trafford and has been linked with several clubs during the transfer window, including Valencia and Juventus.Real Madrid have been linked with former Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao throughout the summer, but his club, Monaco, are thought to be holding out for a hefty loan fee for their prized asset.Falcao's compatriot James Rodriguez has already moved to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer but Real appear to have turned their attention to 'Chicharito' to boost their striking options.Speaking ahead of Villarreal's match against Barcelona, Balague said: "Manchester United and Real Madrid have agreed a one-year loan deal for Chicharito Hernandez to be a player of Real Madrid."Some may say that is surprising because they have lost a midfielder in Xabi Alonso, but they also lost (Alvaro) Morata and Ancelotti decided if they were going to get anybody it will be a Number 9."That's it, Real Madrid have got another striker."Hernandez joined Manchester United from FC Guadalajara four years ago and has scored 59 goals in 154 appearances.The 26-year-old's anticipated departure is the clearest indication that Danny Welbeck's future lies at Old Trafford following reports linking him with a move away from Manchester United this summer.
