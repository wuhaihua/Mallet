While Barcelona dominated with 72% of the possession, Villarreal were stubborn and put in an impressive defensive display, before teenage substitute Sandro Ramirez finally got his side in front in the 82nd minute. Villarreal, who finished 7th last season, were unable to hit the target during the match, compared to Barcelona&rsquo;s 20 attempts with 8 on target. Newcomers Claudio Bravo, Jeremy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitic all started, while youngster Munir El Haddadi was preferred to Neymar, who is still recovering from the back injury suffered during the World Cup. Neymar was brought on with a third of the game remaining and almost made an immediate impact, setting up a chance with one of his first touches. Eventually, the Villarreal resistance was broken when 18 year-old Sandro Ramirez tapped in from close range. While Barcelona did not get a scoreline they deserved, they continued their perfect start to the season and have set the standard to rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. Once Luis Suarez is back from his ban and Neymar returns to full fitness, the Barcelona side look like certain contenders for the La Liga title.
