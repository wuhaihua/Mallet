Mandatory Credit: Sam Sharpe-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The opening weekend of the 2014 college football season is almost over, and on Monday night, the Louisville Cardinals and the Miami Hurricanes will have the national spotlight all to themselves to cap everything off. And the &lsquo;Canes will be displaying a bit of a new look when they take the field.  This offseason, much like we saw from Florida State on Saturday night, the Hurricanes were given new uniforms by the folks at Nike, and when they take the field against the Cardinals, they will be sporting their first pair of the new digs. Here is a look at what Al Golden&rsquo;s team will be wearing on Monday night, courtesy of the best model they could find, star running back Duke Johnson.

Last season Miami started the season off 7-0, having many believe that the program was back to their usual, dominant selves. However, they then took a trip to Tallahassee and were blown out by the rival &lsquo;Noles, and the wheels fell off from there. What do you think of the Miami uniforms?
