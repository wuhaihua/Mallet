			A superb unbeaten century from Adam Lyth helped Yorkshire tighten their grip on their County Championship fixture with Roses rivals Lancashire at Old Trafford.Opener Lyth made 182 not out as the Tykes, currently sitting on top of the Division One table, closed day two of a critical fixture for both counties on 396-5, meaning a lead of 118 runs.Alex Lees (40) and Kane Williamson (46) also made useful contributions for the visitors, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow smashed 60 from just 64 balls with eight fours and a six.Adil Rashid was then unbeaten on 44 at stumps, he and Lyth – who by the end of Monday’s play had faced 318 deliveries and hit 17 fours and a solitary six – putting on an unbroken stand of 115 that has put the White Rose county in a seriously strong position at the halfway stage of the match.Yorkshire’s nearest challengers in the table are Nottinghamshire, though their push to take over at the summit hit a snag when they surrendered a first-innings lead in a see-saw game against Durham.The visitors - who had been reduced to 59-4 the previous evening - were  bowled out for 188 at Chester-le-Street, John Hastings finishing with 4-64 while Paul Collingwood claimed 3-26.Despite holding a 65-run advantage when they came out to bat again, Durham were soon in trouble as Gary Keedy rolled back the years. The veteran left-arm spinner, making his first appearance for Notts, picked up four wickets to reduce the hosts to 137-7.However, Collingwood dug in to make an unbeaten 38 in two hours at the crease and, along with Paul Coughlin (36 not out), he helped carry his side to 196-7 by the close, meaning they will begin day three 261 runs ahead.Meanwhile, Warwickshire’s title charge was frustrated by rain and bad light at Lord’s, as they were only able to add 24 runs to their overnight total before declaring on 362-8 against Middlesex.Rikki Clarke missed out on a first championship century of the summer as he added only a further run before falling to Toby Roland-Jones for 94.Jeetan Patel also fell, bowled by Tim Murtagh for eight, but Keith Barker was 72 not out by the time visiting captain Varun Chopra decided to end his side’s first innings early. However Middlesex were unable to begin their reply due to poor overhead conditions. In the other Division One game taking place, relegation-threatened Northamptonshire closed a shortened day two on 135-4 in reply to Somerset's total of 314.Only 29 overs of play were possible at Taunton and Stephen Peters (46) and James Kettleborough (49) looked to be making good progress when they carried their opening partnership onto 109.But Craig Overton removed both well-set batsmen and then also had Kyle Coetzer caught behind for 11 as the visitors slipped to 135-4 by the time umpires called a halt to proceedings due to bad light.
