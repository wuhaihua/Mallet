			Carla Bianca completed a four-timer with a hard-fought triumph in the Xtravision & HMW Supporting Irish Autism Action Dance Design Fillies Stakes.The Dermot Weld-trained filly, wearing the Moyglare Stud colours carried to victory by Dance Design in the 1996 Irish Oaks, continued her progression to land Group Three honours over nine furlongs.The 5-4 favourite asserted in the closing stages to hold Pearl Of Africa by a length with Alive Alive Oh third.Weld said: "That's four now back-to-back for this filly. She was slow in the spring to get going, but has progressed with every run and it was a nice performance today."The Blandford is a possibility for her and the faster the ground the better for her."I thought nine furlongs was her correct trip, but the way she came home today pleased me most of all because she has a lot of pace."I liked the way she came home in the last half-furlong."
