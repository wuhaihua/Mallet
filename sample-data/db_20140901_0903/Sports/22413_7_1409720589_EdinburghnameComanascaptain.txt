			Edinburgh has announced experienced back row Mike Coman will captain the team this season with Scotland international lock Grant Gilchrist as his deputy.New Zealand Coman, who turns 27 later this month, signed for Edinburgh on a two-year contract during the 2013/14 campaign, and was captain of the side when Greig Laidlaw was playing for Scotland."It's a massive honour, we've got an exciting team and I'm really looking forward to the season ahead,” Coman said"The first time I led a team was Nelson Bay under-16s and, more recently, I was captain of Hawke's Bay for the last four years."What makes a good captain? Staying calm in tough situations and having an idea of how your players are feeling outside of the game.“You have to take care of your playing ability so that the boys can follow – take pride in your performance.”Gilchrist became a full time professional player in season 2011/12 and the 24-year-old went on to win his first Scotland cap during the 2013 RBS 6 Nations.He also led Scotland in two of this summer's Tests, against Argentina and South Africa.Edinburgh Rugby head coach Alan Solomons said: "Mike has a lot of experience in a leadership role, captaining his former club Hawke's Bay, and stood in to lead Edinburgh last season when Greig was on international duty."Grant has come on in leaps and bounds in terms of leadership and this will be another step in developing those qualities."I look forward to working very closely with them both."
