How preseason favorites fared in Week 1 of high school football How preseason favorites fared in Week 1 of high school football  So how rough was Week 1 for the 2014 preseason favorites? 11 out of the CSN High School Lites Top 25 Power Ranking teams lost including 4 of the Top 10 led by previous #1 ranked Bolingbrook (0-1) who had an early punt blocked and returned for a Hinsdale Central (1-0) touchdown and the Raiders never really recovered.
Several teams also opened the season against Out of State opponents to mixed results. Mount Carmel (0-1) lost to nationally ranked St. Joseph from Philadelphia 28-27 at Toyota Park on Sunday as part of the annual Preseason Prep Bowl Kickoff. Glenbard North (0-1) traveled to Centerville, Ohio and lost 33-28. Loyola Academy (1-0) put up a 44-0 win over Milwaukee (Wisc.) Marquette while Stevenson (1-0) defeated Indian Hills (Wisc.) 35-0.
East St. Louis (0-1) also traveled to Cincinnati last Saturday and lost to nationally ranked St. Xavier 35-20. The Flyers headed back home on Sunday and will now travel to Lombard on Saturday to take on Montini Catholic (0-1). In case your wondering, that's over 1,200 miles traveled in seven days for East St. Louis.

CSN's The Drive's Providence Catholic (1-0) and head coach Mark Coglianese showed in it's 21-10 win last Friday night over rival Joliet Catholic (0-1) that the Celtics passing attack will be a real force in 2014. Senior QB Justin Hunniford completed 25-of-31 passes for 266 yards and two touchdowns while both senior Notre Dame commit WR Miles Boykin along with Iowa commit TE Nate Vejvoda headline a deep group of receivers. The Celtics defense also played well in the win, limited the Joliet Catholic power running game to just 61 yards rushing for the game.
Glenbard West (1-0) also came into it's game against Wheaton South (0-1) knowing that this is the last regular season game in a what has been a terrific local rivalry game. With the DuPage Valley expanding to nine teams starting next season the schedules wouldn't allow the series to continue. So who will the Hilltoppers play to start the 2015 season? None other than Class 8A power Bolingbrook.
Simeon (0-1) lost a heart breaker 28-26 on Sunday night in the finale of the annual Preseason Prep Bowl Classic at Toyota Park as St. Rita's Mike Tiernan intercepted a Simeon two point conversion pass for the win. Despite the loss the Wolverines and head coach Dante Culthbreath look to have a pretty strong team for 2014. Keep an eye on a large offense line led by senior OT Joel VanAllen (6-foot-5, 270 pounds) along with junior OT Terrell Maklin-Dupree (6-foot-5, 320 pounds) plus speed on both sides of the football in 2014.
Most impressive win of Week 1? Hard to argue against Chicago Phillips (1-0) going on the road to defending Class 3A state champion Stillman Valley and pulling off a 51-0 rout of the Cardinals as senior QB DeWayne Collins threw 6 touchdown passes in the win. Phillips and head coach Mike Lawson will be a force to watch in the Chicago Public League and in particular in Class 4A come state playoff time.
