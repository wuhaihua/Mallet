Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY SportsxSoccer    Apparently there&rsquo;s a need for more than one mascot if you are Zenit St. Petersburg from Russia. That&rsquo;s because earlier this weekend the Russian club announced the signing of a deal with 20th Century Fox that included adding venerable cartoon character Bart Simpson to the fold as an official mascot. Zenit signs one of the biggest stars in the world just before the transfer window closes!! http://t.co/OBR9UeD4zs pic.twitter.com/JlqAXn1dZc &mdash; FC Zenit in English (@fczenit_en) September 1, 2014 Yes, that&rsquo;s FC Zenit manager Andre Villas-Boas sitting next to whomever is in the Bart Simpson costume for an official signing photograph.  Naturally, FC Zenit decided to play up the signing of the world&rsquo;s most famous cartoon character within its own press release. From the press release: Bartholomew Jo Jo (Bart) Simpson first appeared onscreen in 1987 and because of this he has decided to take 87 as his number. The footballer arrived a few days ago at Pulkovo and went to the club&rsquo;s office to meet with the general director of Zenit, Maksim Mitrofanov. Bart had his medical exam at the MMC SOGAZ department The Nevsky Corinthia Palace, went to Petrovksy, the new store &ldquo;Zenit Arena&rdquo; and then made his way out to Udelny Park. Considering the ongoing Every Simpsons Ever marathon on FXX and the push for the Simpsons by 20th Century Fox in general, this type of move shouldn&rsquo;t be all that surprising. However, it just goes to show the lengths some teams will go to get publicity and make a buck or Rubel in this case.
