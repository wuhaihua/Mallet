                    Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch has a bit of a Skittles obsession.

In his earlier days, his mother would give him his &quot;power pellets&quot; &mdash; Skittles &mdash; during games. This tradition became so well known opposing players even mocked him for it. (Bad move, Arizona Cardinals.)

Lynch&#39;s endorsement became official prior to last year&#39;s Super Bowl victory and he even tossed Skittles from a duck boat during the Seahawks parade.

In a season-opening ad, Lynch works Skittles into his offseason conditioning routine in a way you&#39;ve never seen.



Worst-case scenario? Lynch drops the weights and has more &quot;power pellets&quot; than he probably knows how to handle. This is what you&#39;d call a &quot;good problem.&quot;
