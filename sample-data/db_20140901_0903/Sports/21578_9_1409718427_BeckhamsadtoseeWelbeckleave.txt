            David Beckham says he is sad to see Danny Welbeck leave Manchester United but believes he will shine at Arsenal.Striker Welbeck, who came through the Old Trafford youth system, joined the Gunners for &pound;16m on transfer deadline day."Arsenal have a very good, young talented English player," said former United midfielder Beckham."To see him leave Manchester United is sad. He had been there since he was eight and his heart was in Manchester."Welbeck is currently away with the England squad ahead of their friendly with Norway on Wednesday as they prepare for next Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland."The biggest bonus is for Danny Welbeck," said England boss Roy Hodgson."When you are a player of his calibre and find yourself at United with competition for places, you don't always get the starts you would like."He is going to a club where he will hopefully get more starts and playing time."BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty:"With the presence of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, as well as British record &pound;59.7m signing Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata and youngster Adnan Januzaj, Van Gaal has an embarrassment of riches that enabled United to sanction the sale of Welbeck to rivals Arsenal."However, they have looked short of strength and numbers in central defence and central midfield. Have they put the roof on the house while the foundations remain in need of serious attention?"Welbeck made his senior debut for United in 2008 and went on to start 53 Premier League games for United, with a further 39 appearances from the bench.However, competition for places has increased under manager Louis van Gaal, who was appointed in May.The Dutchman brought in Colombia striker Radamel Falcao from Monaco in a &pound;6m loan deal on Monday, while Argentina winger Angel Di Maria was signed for a British-record &pound;59.7m from Real Madrid last month.Di Maria is wearing the number seven shirt this season, previously worn by Beckham, who played for United between 1992 and 2003.Former England captain Beckham, speaking as an ambassador for Sainsbury's School Games which starts in Manchester on Thursday, added: "Di Maria is obviously a very talented player. "He has played in the World Cup and won the Champions League but my advice to him wearing the number seven shirt is to enjoy it because wearing that shirt is without a doubt one of the proudest moments I have had in my career."
