Coach Jim Harbaugh said he expects veteran special-teamer Kassim Osgood to return to the 49ers' 53-man roster on Tuesday.
Harbaugh said on his KNBR radio show that he anticipates Osgood being back on the team with the likelihood that nose tackle Glenn Dorsey will be placed on injured reserve/designated for return. That move would create a roster spot for Osgood's return. Osgood was among the 49ers' final cuts on Saturday.
The 49ers would also like at some point to get back Bubba Ventrone, a special-teams player who was also released on Saturday.
