Pats sign QB for practice squad; Boyce, Bequette retained Pats sign QB for practice squad; Boyce, Bequette retained September 1, 2014, 1:30 pm FOXBORO -- Defensive end Jake Bequette and wide receiver Josh Boyce -- both draft picks by the Patriots in recent years -- have been re-signed to the team’s 10-man practice squad.
The others being kept on retainer are quarterback McLeod Bethel-Thompson, linebacker Ja’Gared Davis, safety Kanorris Davis, running back Jonas Gray, defensive lineman/long-snapper Charley Hughlett, offensive lineman Chris Martin, defensive lineman Deonate Skinner and defensive back Daxton Swanson.
Bethel-Thompson is the only player with no previous employment experience in New England. He’s a third-year player from Sacramento State, who has been with Miami (2011), Minnesota (2012-2013) and San Francisco (2013). The 6-foot-3, 230-pounder was originally signed by the 49ers on July 28, 2011, as a rookie free agent. He was released by San Francisco at the end of training camp and joined the Miami practice squad in late December. Bethel-Thompson spent the entire 2012 season as the third-string quarterback for Minnesota. He was released by the Vikings in October of 2013 and was claimed and awarded to San Francisco, where he spent time on both the 53-man roster and the practice squad.
Gray and Swanson both had particularly solid camps for the Patriots.
It’s a little surprising the team didn’t bring back sixth-round guard Jon Halapio for developmental purposes. Also, defensive lineman Jerel Worthy, acquired from the Packers during camp and released on Saturday, is another player with practice-squad eligibility.
