			Wolverhampton have cancelled the contract of Polish star Piotr Pawlicki after his latest withdrawal from an Elite League meeting.Wolves chief Chris Van Straaten took the action after receiving several messages on Monday morning stating Pawlicki would be unavailable to race in their home match against Leicester.Van Straaten said: “Enough is enough. It’s just not fair on the team, the promotion and most importantly the supporters.“It’s with a heavy heart we have made this decision, it cannot be allowed to go on and it’s probably because he is such a wonderful talent on a speedway bike that we have allowed it to go on this long. We haven’t seen him in Wolverhampton colours since August 4.”
