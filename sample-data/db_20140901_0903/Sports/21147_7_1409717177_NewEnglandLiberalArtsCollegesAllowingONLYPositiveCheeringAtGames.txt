Surely, NESCAC will be asking their athletes in the near future to refrain from showing emotion while on the field of play.Perhaps a &#8216;must play rule&#8217; should be implemented, or eliminating rivalries from the conference completely.Smiling must also be a staple of the NESCAC athletic foundation. Look out players and fans, if you frown, you could be tossed Bobby Cox style. Not having fun because you are losing by four goals? Put a smile on!They must think negative political ads are the bane of America&#8217;s existence.Treat your fans and student-athletes like their 10-year-old children some more, NESCAC. I&#8217;m sure they greatly appreciate it.
