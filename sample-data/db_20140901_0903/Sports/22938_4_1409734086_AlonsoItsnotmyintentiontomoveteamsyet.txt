Alonso: 'It's not my intention to move teams yet' Alonso: 'It's not my intention to move teams yet' 
Fernando Alonso has rebuffed recent claims he is set to leave Ferrari for McLaren next season as the Woking outfit makes a final push to secure his services.
The Spaniard insists he wants to win the championship with Ferrari and see through a period of change at the Italian outfit.
"It's not my intention at the moment to move," he told Sky Sports ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.
"I want to win for Ferrari, I want to win here and finish the job that we started some years ago and we will see what the future comes."
Alonso is often linked with other teams. In 2013 it was suggested he would join Red Bull after his manager confirmed talks took place. He is now linked with McLaren.&nbsp;
Alonso says the speculation creates tension between him and Ferrari, but he's happy to know that he remains in demand.
"Obviously there has been a lot of talk from the summer of last year, the start more or less, but from my mouth never came any interest to leave to Ferrari or any words saying that I will join another team," he added.
"There are a lot of speculations which is not disturbing but it creates a bit of tension around and stress.
"But also you feel proud, you feel happy that the best teams have interest in you and they say it in public. "
