49ers starter in jail on domestic violence charge 49ers starter in jail on domestic violence charge San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald is in jail Sunday morning, held without bail on a felony charge of domestic violence, according to Santa Clara County Department of Corrections records.McDonald, 29, was booked into the jail at 5:30 a.m. Sunday."The 49ers organization is aware of the recent reports regarding Ray McDonald and we take such matters seriously," the 49ers said in a statement Sunday morning. "As we continue to gather the facts, we will reserve further comment."McDonald's arrest, first reported by NBC Bay Area, comes just three days after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell implemented a massive overhaul to how the league handles players involved in domestic violence incidents. The first incident will result in a six-game suspension, while a second incident carries an indefinite ban with a minimum of one year.The changes came after Goodell and the NFL faced fierce criticism after Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice received a two-game suspension after assaulting his now-wife in February.McDonald has been a full-time starter for the 49ers since 2011, and has been with the team since 2007.
