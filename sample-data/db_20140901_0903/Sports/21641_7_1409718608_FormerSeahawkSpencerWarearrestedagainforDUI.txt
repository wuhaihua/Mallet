                    SEATTLE&nbsp;&mdash; Former&nbsp;Seahawks running back Spencer Ware was arrested early Tuesday for investigation of driving under the influence.

KIRO-TV reports&nbsp;jail records show Ware was booked into the Kent city jail at 3:21 a.m. He has not been charged. The case was referred to the Maple Valley prosecutor&#39;s office.

Ware was waived in Saturday when the Seahawks roster was trimmed to 53. He played two games for the Seahawks in 2013 after skipping his final year of eligibility at Louisiana State University to enter the NFL draft.

This was Ware&#39;s second DUI arrest this year. He was arrested in January in Seattle. That case was dismissed after a judge suppressed evidence gathered after he was stopped by the State Patrol.

Ware is scheduled to appear in Maple Valley Municipal Court on Sept. 8.
