                        The         Texas A&M Aggies, buoyed by their victory over         South Carolina, moved up 12 spots to No. 9 in the AP Top 25 after the opening weekend of college football.

     

The top four in the rankings --         Florida State,         Alabama,         Oregon and         Oklahoma -- are unchanged, but the No. 1 Seminoles and No. 2 Crimson Tide lost some support in the first poll of the regular season after close victories against heavy underdogs.





Texas A&M began the post-Johnny Manziel era with a 52-28 victory at South Carolina. The loss dropped the Gamecocks from No. 9 to No. 21.

The         Georgia Bulldogs, led by running back         Todd Gurley, rose six spots to No. 6 -- even earning two first-place votes -- after an impressive 45-21 victory over then-No. 16         Clemson, which tumbled seven spots to No. 23.

Florida State went from 57 first-place votes to 46 after pulling out a 37-31 victory against Oklahoma State. Meanwhile, Alabama dropped 44 points in the media-panel voting, getting just one first-place vote, after beating West Virginia.

Oregon received five first-place votes, Oklahoma two and No. 12         LSU got one after rallying to beat then-No. 14 Wisconsin, which fell four spots in this week's poll.

Louisville was the only new team in the poll this week, entering at No. 25 after beating Miami, 31-13, in the Cardinals' ACC debut.
