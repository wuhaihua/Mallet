                    Having disposed of Finland on Saturday, the United States men&#39;s basketball team returned to action Sunday in Spain. Their opponent: Turkey.

Solid defense and 58 percent shooting sealed a 114-55 victory in the team&#39;s opener. The Turks proved tougher opponents early in Sunday&#39;s game in Bilboa, Spain.

U.S. shooters weren&#39;t a dialed in as they were against the Finns. They also weren&#39;t as sharp, making turnovers and finding themselves a step off in the offensive zone.

With the usual dose of caution, coach Mike Krzyzewski said the Turks &quot;showed great heart&quot; in their Saturday victory over New Zealand. Observers believe Turkey&#39;s big men could pose a problem for the Americans.

To be realistic, Turkey struggled against a lightly regarded team in its opener. Its backcourt could be in real trouble against a fast, deep American team.

Omar Asik, a center for the New Orleans Pelicans, is the best-known player in Turkey&#39;s lineup.
