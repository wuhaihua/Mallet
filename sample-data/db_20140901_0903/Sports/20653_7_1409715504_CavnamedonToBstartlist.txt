			Mark Cavendish will look to add to his tally of ten Tour of Britain stage wins next week after being named in a strong Omega Pharma – Quick-Step line-up.Although the Belgian team have yet to confirm their six-man squad, Cavendish was included on a provisional start list for the race alongside Mark Renshaw, Niki Terpstra, Michal Kwiatkowski, Michal Golas and Julien Vermote.The 29-year-old Manxman is the second big-name Briton to have been selected for his home tour, after defending champion Sir Bradley Wiggins was chosen to lead Team Sky.Cavendish has won three stages in each of the last two editions of the race, but will face stiff competition to continue that run this year given that Marcel Kittel, his arch rival, has been called up by Giant-Shimano.Cavendish is still searching for peak condition following shoulder surgery in the wake of his crash in July's Tour de France, but he hinted at a return to form by winning two stages of last week's Tour du Poitou-Charantes.The Tour of Britain takes place from Sunday, September 7, to Sunday, September 14, starting and ending with sprints stages in Livepool and London respectively.Other marquee names to have been included on the provisional start list include Ireland’s Nicolas Roche, Tour de France stage winner Lars Boom and in-form Frenchman Sylvain Chavanel.Omega Pharma - Quick-Step's provisional Tour of Britain team: Mark Cavendish (GB), Michal Golas (Pol), Michal Kwiatkowski (Pol), Mark Renshaw (Aus), Niki Terpstra (Ned), Julien Vermote (Bel).
