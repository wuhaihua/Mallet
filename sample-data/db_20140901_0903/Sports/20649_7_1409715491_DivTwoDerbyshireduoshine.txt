			Worcestershire showed the character that has taken them to the top of Division Two to leave the LV= County Championship match against Derbyshire at Derby in the balance at the end of the third day.The visitors were still behind the game going into day three 135 runs adrift but by the time the seventh-wicket pair of  Joe Leach and Shaaiq Choudhry were parted, they were closing in on a lead.A stand of 117 in 37 overs between Leach (71) and Choudhry (44) lifted Worcestershire to 385 and a lead of 29 with Mark Footitt taking 6-115.Ben Slater (65) and Billy Godleman (52) scored half-centuries in an opening stand of 125 - Derbyshire's highest in the championship.However, they both fell before the close to leave the home side 116 in front at 145-2, giving both teams a chance of victory on the last day.Sam Northeast and Gareth Rees starred for Kent and Glamorgan respectively with the bat as their clash appears set to end in a draw.Kent, resuming on their overnight score of 205-4 and still trailing by 124 on first innings, saw their best hope of adding impetus into the game perish within 20 minutes when Darren Stevens departed for 30.Northeast notched 102 off 202 balls for his second ton of the championship season to help Kent to 329 at the end of their first innings.But Rees, scoring his first championship 50 since the last week in April from 91 balls and with six fours and a six,  finished the penultimate day 72 not out as Glamorgan reached 150-3, with a lead of 92 runs, at stumps.Glamorgan's rookie spinner Kieran Bull was the pick of the bowlers, claiming 4-62.
