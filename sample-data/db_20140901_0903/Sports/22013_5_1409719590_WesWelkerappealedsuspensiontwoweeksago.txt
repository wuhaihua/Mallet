Wes Welker appealed suspension two weeks ago Wes Welker appealed suspension two weeks ago Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsNFL    After he was suspended for four games for violating the NFL&rsquo;s PED policy on Tuesday, Denver Broncos&rsquo; wide receiver Wes Welker issued a statement in which he says he was &ldquo;as shocked as everyone at today&rsquo;s news.&rdquo;&nbsp;That might not be entirely true, however.  According to Mike Klis of the Denver Post, Welker and the Broncos have known about this failed test and a possible suspension for a couple weeks now. Furthermore, the Broncos were upset at the timing of the announcement of the suspension because they had already started their preparation for their season-opening game against the Indianapolis Colts Sunday night in Denver. Klis explains: The Broncos were irate at the timing of the Welker&rsquo;s suspension as it occurred Tuesday evening &mdash; after the team finished game planning for its regular-season opener Sunday night against Indianapolis. Ordinarily, the league announces such suspensions on Monday, to give teams adequate time to game plan. Welker&rsquo;s suspension was reported by ESPN on Tuesday evening, nearly two hours after the league and players&rsquo; union offices closed&hellip; &hellip;Welker appealed his suspension two weeks ago in Washington D.C. , apparently to no avail. Whatever wrong Welker perceives in how this was handed down will be lost in the noise for a number of reasons, the fact that he was doing ecstasy chief among them. The timing of the suspension and the policy itself are on the fringe of the issue at this point, with the Broncos knowing they will out be without their slot receiver extraordinaire to open the 2014 season.
