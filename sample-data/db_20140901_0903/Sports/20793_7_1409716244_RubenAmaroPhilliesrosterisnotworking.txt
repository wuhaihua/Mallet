Ruben Amaro: Phillies' roster 'is not working' Ruben Amaro: Phillies' roster 'is not working' 
           
                    Kudos, Ruben Amaro. Admitting you have a roster in need of a shakeup is the first step.

The Phillies general manager told reporters Monday that changes to his last-place team are coming.



&ldquo;I think we need it. I think we need it because what we have on our roster right now is not working,&quot; Amaro said, per MLB.com&#39;s Todd Zolecki. &quot;How much we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;do will depend on what makes sense for us. We&rsquo;re still kind of assessing what we have. But I think it would behoove us to make some change because we need to&nbsp;be better.&rdquo;

Amaro steadfastly refused to move some of his veterans, such as Cole Hamels, Jonathan Papelbon and Marlon Byrd, at the July 31 non-waiver deadline. He made just two waiver deals in August:&nbsp;starting pitcher Roberto Hernandez to the Dodgers for minor leaguers Jesmuel Valentin and Victor Arano, and&nbsp;backup outfielder/first baseman John Mayberry Jr. to the Blue Jays for minor league infielder Gustavo Pierre.

If Amaro is serious about freshening the roster via trades, the assessment period shouldn&#39;t take long; Hamels, Papelbon, Byrd and other high-priced vets (Ryan Howard, Cliff Lee, Jimmy Rollins,&nbsp;Chase Utley, A.J. Burnett&nbsp;and Carlos Ruiz) are well known to the front office.

Then again . . .

All of those players have some kind of no-trade protection, which in theory will limit what&nbsp;Amaro can get&nbsp;in return. Amaro reportedly was driving way too hard a bargain in trade talks this summer, asking for top prospects plus&nbsp;salary relief.

Also,&nbsp;Amaro is a notorious win-now GM.&nbsp;Rather than rebuild, could he go the other way and deal youth for more veterans, payroll constraints be damned? Would he dare dangle the likes of Maikel Franco, David&nbsp;Buchanan, Cody Asche, Darin Ruf&nbsp;and Cameron Rupp?

That doesn&#39;t seem logical, but who knows?&nbsp;
