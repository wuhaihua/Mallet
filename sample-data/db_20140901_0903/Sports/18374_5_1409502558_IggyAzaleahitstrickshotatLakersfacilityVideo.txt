Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Not only is Iggy Azalea &lsquo;fancy&rsquo; on record, she can apparently put it down on the basketball court to.  The girlfriend of Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young, Iggy Azalea and her beau decided to hit up the team practice facility in El Segundo recently and put in some work. The two played a bit of one-on-one but mostly spent their evening taking jumpers, though it was Azalea who ended up being the star of the night. With Nick Young&rsquo;s camera rolling, the Australian-born rapper walked behind the glass and at an angle, decided to put up a shot. It was that prototypical shot that your one friend had mastered when you were a child and continually beat you on when you played HORSE. Apparently, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal for Iggy Iggy though as the popular rap artist knocked down the shot with ease, seemingly shocking her boyfriend as he couldn&rsquo;t contain his excitement once the net rippled. Azalea, wearing a sports bra and Los Angeles Lakers pants didn&rsquo;t seem overly thrilled with her trick shot, though we don&rsquo;t really know how many attempts she needed to actually knock it down. You&rsquo;d figure she&rsquo;d be a lot happier if she had spent twenty minutes trying to hit the shot though, so maybe Iggy&rsquo;s a closet basketball freak who spends her down time acting like she&rsquo;s a member of the Harlem Globetrotters.  One thing is for certain. Nick Young and Iggy Azalea certainly know how to have a good time.
