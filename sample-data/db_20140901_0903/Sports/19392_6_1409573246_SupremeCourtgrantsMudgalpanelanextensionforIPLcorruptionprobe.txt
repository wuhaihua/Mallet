Supreme Court grants Mudgal panel an extension for IPL corruption probe Supreme Court grants Mudgal panel an extension for IPL corruption probe 
										
		Delhi: The Supreme Court has granted the Justice Mudgal Committee two more months to complete the probe against ICC chairman, and suspended BCCI president, N Srinivasan and others in IPL betting and match-fixing scandal. 
In a hearing that lasted nearly 90 minutes, the Court also said Srinivasan cannot be allowed to discharge his job as BCCI president till a report is filed by Justice Mudgal. The BCCI elections are currently slated for 30 September and if they are held on schedule, the court's order means Srinivasan will not be able to stand for re-election.

The Supreme Court also allowed the committee to file any interim report on Srinivasan or any office bearer of BCCI.
Meanwhile Aditya Verma, the secretary of the Cricket Association of Bihar, and the man responsible for the investigation into the IPL scam, said he would "oppose" any kind of move from either BCCI or their president-in-exile N Srinivasan to try and delay the Annual General Meeting of the cricket board.
"Being a petitioner in this case, I will oppose any move from the BCCI or N Srinivasan regarding the extension of BCCI's AGM. In the history of 86 years of BCCI, there is not a single instance of postponement of AGM," Verma was quoted as saying in a press release.
Verma also appealed to the Supreme Court about a pending application which states that BCCI's interim president Shivlal Yadav and secrtary Sanjay Patel have violated the ruling and court order by nominating Srinivasan as their candidate for the post of ICC chairman.
