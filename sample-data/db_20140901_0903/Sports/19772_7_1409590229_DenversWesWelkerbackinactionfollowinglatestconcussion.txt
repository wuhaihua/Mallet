                    ENGLEWOOD, Colo.&nbsp;&mdash; Wes Welker returned to practice Monday for the first time since sustaining a concussion in an Aug. 23 preseason game against the Houston Texans.

The Denver slot receiver ran short routes during the 20-minute viewing period open to the media.

Welker&#39;s concussion was his third in 10 months. He got hurt on a hard hit from D.J. Swearinger that prompted Peyton Manning to swear at the swaggering safety.

That earned the five-time MVP the first taunting penalty of his career along with an $8,268 fine.

Welker caught 73 passes for 778 yards and a career-high 10 TDs last season despite missing the last 3 1-2 games. He also had 18 grabs for 160 yards and a TD in the playoffs.
