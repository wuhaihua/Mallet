Cavaliers' Anderson Varejao: I'm 100 percent healthy Cavaliers' Anderson Varejao: I'm 100 percent healthy Nov 13, 2013; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Minnesota Timberwolves power forward Kevin Love (42) and Cleveland Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao (17) battle for position>NBA    Cleveland Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao has dealt with his fair share of injury problems over the years. He&rsquo;s appeared in just 146 of a possible 312 games in the past four seasons&nbsp;.  But Varejao, who is in Spain participating in the FIBA World Cup as a member of the Brazilian national team, says he is currently 100 percent healthy. From John Schuhmann of NBA.com: NBA.com: How do you feel now compared to the last couple of years? Varejao:&nbsp;I feel pretty good. I feel like I&rsquo;m 100 percent. I feel like I&rsquo;m moving a lot better. I&rsquo;m healthy. I feel like I&rsquo;m in shape. So this helps a lot. How do you look back at the last four years, not only not playing with LeBron, but not being able to play a full season? Varejao:&nbsp;Tough four years for me. It was very tough on me. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, because every year that I was doing well, people were talking about All-Star, this and that, and then I would get hurt. So it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it&rsquo;s all past now. The good thing is that I&rsquo;m in shape, I&rsquo;m healthy, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next season. The Cavs obviously have a real shot to compete for a championship this season with LeBron James back in Cleveland, making Varejao&rsquo;s health even more crucial. Cleveland is fairly thin from a center/rim-protection standpoint, so Varejao will&nbsp;absolutely hold a vital role on this team. The big man&nbsp;averaged 8.4 points and 9.7 rebounds per game this past season with Cleveland. &nbsp;
