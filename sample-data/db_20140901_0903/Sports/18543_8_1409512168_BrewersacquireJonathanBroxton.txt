Brewers acquire Jonathan Broxton Brewers acquire Jonathan Broxton 
 

The         Milwaukee Brewers have acquired right-handed reliever         Jonathan Broxton from the         Cincinnati Reds for two players to be named later.

     

Broxton, 30, is 4-2 with 7 saves and a 1.86 ERA in 48 1/3 innings this season. He has 118 career saves.

He is owed about $1.2 million for the rest of 2014, based on his $7 million salary, and $9 million for 2015. 

In order for a player to be eligible for a postseason roster, he must be a member of the playoff team by Aug. 31, which is why the Brewers needed to trade for Broxton on Sunday in order to have him available for the postseason.

Milwaukee entered Sunday's games with a one-game lead in the National League Central over the          St. Louis Cardinals.
