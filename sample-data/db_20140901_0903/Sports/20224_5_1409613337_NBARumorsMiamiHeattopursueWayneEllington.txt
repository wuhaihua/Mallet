NBA Rumors: Miami Heat to pursue Wayne Ellington? NBA Rumors: Miami Heat to pursue Wayne Ellington? Oct 14, 2013; Dallas, TX, USA; Dallas Mavericks shooting guard Wayne Ellington (21) drives to the basket during the first half against the Orlando Magic at American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNBA    The Sacramento Kings waived shooting guard Wayne Ellington on Monday, setting him up to be a free agent target. Ellington is far from a great player, but he can shoot the ball well and can help a number of teams searching for anther two-guard. One of those shooting guard-needy teams is the Miami Heat, so it&rsquo;s not surprising to hear speculation that Miami could pursue the 26-year-old. In wake of ESPN report of Kings waiving Wayne Ellington, sure seems like a name that could make sense for Heat. Must first clear waivers. &mdash; Ira Winderman (@IraHeatBeat) September 1, 2014 Ellington averaged 3.2 points on 43.7 percent shooting from the floor and 42.4 percent shooting from beyond the arc this past season with the Dallas Mavericks. He could fill in nicely as a floor-spacer off the bench for Miami.  Still, Ellington obviously isn&rsquo;t the Heat&rsquo;s first choice as a backup shooting guard. That would be Ray Allen, as noted by Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. The Heat would love for Allen to come back but know that&rsquo;s unlikely. Associates say he has been conflicted about whether to retire or sign with Cleveland or another top contender (the Clippers and Spurs also want him). With Allen not seeming&nbsp;like a realistic option and few other talented shooting guards on the market right now, Ellington makes sense. The Minnesota Timberwolves drafted Ellington with the No. 28 pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. Ellington has played for four teams throughout his five-year career.
