Detroit Lions release unofficial depth chart: Nick Fairley starting again Detroit Lions release unofficial depth chart: Nick Fairley starting again Aug 9, 2014; Detroit, MI, USA; Detroit Lions defensive tackle Nick Fairley (98) during the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Ford Field. Detroit won 13-12. Mandatory Credit: Tim Fuller-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Lions released their unofficial depth on Monday. Head coach Jim Caldwell said he wouldn&rsquo;t discuss starting roles until a depth chart appeared. However, this depth chart was arranged by the media relations department, not the coaches, so it must be taken with a grain of salt.  That said, the biggest depth chart movement is that of Nick Fairley. The defensive tackle struggled at times and lost his grip of the starting role.&nbsp;His on-field performance is disappointing and his off-the-field actions are worse.&nbsp;This offseason, Fairley was&nbsp;sentenced to six months&nbsp;in jail for a DUI and reckless driving charge that dates back to 2012. This may be a step in the right direction for Fairley. Kellen Moore is officially on less solid footing with the team. Matt Stafford&nbsp;has been a sure thing these last three seasons, starting 16 games and throwing for 4,600 yards or more each year. Waddle gets the go-ahead of Hilliard for a starting job. Here are the full notes,&nbsp;via NFL Nation reporter Michael Rothstein: Nick Fairley&nbsp;is apparently back with the starters. He is listed ahead of C.J. Mosley at defensive tackle alongside&nbsp;Ndamukong Suh. LaAdrian Waddle&nbsp;is listed ahead of&nbsp;Corey Hilliard&nbsp;at right tackle, so he might have won the job there. Jed Collins is ahead of&nbsp;Montell Owens&nbsp;at fullback, but this isn&rsquo;t too much of a surprise because he&rsquo;s been working there all camp. Tahir Whitehead is the team&rsquo;s starting SAM linebacker, backed up by&nbsp;Kyle Van Noy.&nbsp;Ashlee Palmer&nbsp;is listed as the backup to WILL linebacker&nbsp;DeAndre Levy. Expect this to change if Van Noy heads to short-term IR. Dan Orlovsky&nbsp;is the No. 2 quarterback over Kellen Moore. Jeremy Ross&nbsp;(backing up&nbsp;Calvin Johnson) and Kevin Ogletree&nbsp;(backing up&nbsp;Golden Tate) are listed as the No. 2 receivers. Fuller is behind Johnson and Ross and Broyles is behind Tate and Ogletree. Jerome Couplin is listed as the No. 2 strong safety behind&nbsp;James Ihedigbo.&nbsp;Don Carey&nbsp;is the No. 2 free safety and Isa Abdul-Quddus the No. 3 free safety.
