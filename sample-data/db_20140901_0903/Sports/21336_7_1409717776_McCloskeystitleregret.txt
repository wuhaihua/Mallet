			Paul McCloskey has revealed his regret at failing to land a world title after announcing his retirement.The 35-year-old Dungiven man called time on his career last week after 27 fights, including European and British title victories.But McCloskey fell short at the top level, suffering a technical decision defeat against Amir Khan in his only shot at a world crown.A nasty cut brought a premature end to his 2011 WBA title challenge and the Northern Irishman believes he was cruelly denied the chance to become a big name in the light-welterweight division.“I had a good career and I picked up a British and European title along the way. I also still believe I should have been a world champion but certain things went against,” he told the Belfast Newsletter.“You need luck at times and I maybe did not get that rub of the green when I needed it.“But I believe I had the talent and the ability to get my hands on a world title - but it was not meant to be.“I have no regrets and I am bowing out because I am not getting any younger.”McCloskey halted Colin Lynes to become British champion in 2008, while another stoppage win over Daniel Rasilla earned him the European belt the following year.He also holds a points win over Breidis Prescott, the Colombian who knocked out Khan, but defeats by DeMarcus Corley and Dave Ryan ended his hopes of further title shots.
