Vollmer says he's never practiced at guard Vollmer says he's never practiced at guard September 1, 2014, 1:30 pm FOXBORO -- Sebastian Vollmer would be open to playing any position the Patriots ask him to play. But if they're going to ask him to move to guard, he'll have to pick things up quickly. 
According to a report from Ben Volin of the Boston Globe on Saturday, the Patriots had a meeting to discuss moving Vollmer to guard and Marcus Cannon to tackle. After the team traded Logan Mankins to the Tampa bay Buccaneers for a fourth-round draft pick and tight end Tim Wright, they've been left without an obvious replacement for Mankins at left guard. 
Vollmer's choice to fill that spot would be an interesting one in that he told reporters on Monday that he has never played guard -- not earlier in his amateur football career and not in practice as a member of the Patriots. 
The 6-foot-7 offensive lineman wouldn't confirm that the team has had discussions of playing him inside, but he said he's open to anything.
"If they put me as wide receiver, I'd do that too," he said. "Whatever they want to do."  FOXBORO -- Sebastian Vollmer would be open to playing any position the Patriots ask him to play. But if they're going to ask him to move to guard, he'll have to pick things up quickly.
