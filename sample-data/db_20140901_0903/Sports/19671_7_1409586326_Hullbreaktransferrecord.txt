			Hull City have completed the signing of Abel Hernandez for a club record fee.The Uruguay striker joins from Italian club Palermo on a three-year deal which includes the option of a further 12 months.The size of the fee has not been revealed, but Hull have confirmed it surpasses that paid to Tottenham for Jake Livermore in June."Abel is a fantastic signing and highlights just how far the club has come in such a short space of time," manager Steve Bruce said."He is an exciting talent and, like myself, I’m sure the supporters can’t wait to see him in action."Hernandez's arrival follows the deadline-day sale of George Boyd to Burnley, while defender Joe Dudgeon's Barnsley loan has been extended until January.
