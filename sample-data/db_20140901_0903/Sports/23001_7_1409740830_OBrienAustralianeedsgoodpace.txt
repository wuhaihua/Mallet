			Aidan O'Brien insists having a pacemaker for his dual Derby winner Australia is not vital but the presence of a pacemaker in his races just ensures a true pace.Kingfisher has helped set a strong enough gallop for Australia in his last three races - the English and Irish Derbies and the Juddmonte International.He also one of O'Brien's 15 entries in the Qipco Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on September 13 when Australia is set to have his next start following his win at York last month."It's not vital but obviously Kingfisher has been with him in the Derbies and at York to make sure it's not a dawdle," O'Brien told At The Races."Australia cruises along and I don't think it's an advantage for anyone if its a dawdle. Kingfisher is happy go along with an even pace and if anyone wants to go faster that's fine too, but he sets a sensible pace and I think it suits most horses really."He had a break after the Derby and then we were just hoping he'd be ready in time to go to York."If he did he was going to go back for the Irish Champion and if we didn't run him at York we were going to go straight for the Irish Champion."
