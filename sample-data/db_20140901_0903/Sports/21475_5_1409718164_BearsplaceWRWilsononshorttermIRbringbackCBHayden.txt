Bears place WR Wilson on short-term IR, bring back CB Hayden Bears place WR Wilson on short-term IR, bring back CB Hayden  Wide receiver Marquess Wilson caught just two passes last season but along the way started putting in the foundation of a relationship with quarterback Jay Cutler. That continued into training camp where Wilson established himself a the leader in a competition to become the No. 3 receiver, which only happens if he has earned the quarterback’s trust.
Wilson’s season took an unfortunate turn in early August when he laid out in a full-extension dive for a training-camp pass. He landed hard, breaking his collarbone in the process and missing the rest of camp and the preseason.
But the plan is for him to be back, with the Bears placing him on injured reserve/designated to return and then re-signing cornerback Kelvin Hayden to the vacated roster spot.

The move means that Wilson may not begin practicing until week seven (Oct. 19), which would be after the Miami Dolphins game. He will not be eligible to return until the Nov. 9 game at Green Bay.
It also means that the Bears do not have the short-term IR tag to use on a second player. They used the designation last year on cornerback Charles Tillman when he tore a triceps muscle but Tillman did not return during the season.
Hayden had a strong training camp and preseason and gives the Bears a solid cornerback corps along with Tillman, Tim Jennings, rookie Kyle Fuller and Demontre Hurst.
