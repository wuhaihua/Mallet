WASHINGTON (CBSDC) &#8211; Thursday Night Football will feature a new musical opening in 2014, set to pop singer Rihanna’s “Run This Town” and the narration of actor Don Cheadle, setting the scene for each week’s NFL matchup on CBS Sports and NFL Network.
Each of the 16 Thursday Night Football game introductions will roll into the question ‘Who will run this town?’ CBS says in a press release, with openings customized to that given week&#8217;s matchup.
“This open combines one of music’s biggest stars with one of the most dynamic actors in Hollywood,” said CBS Sports creative director Pete Radovich, who produced the opening. “The energy that both talents provide gives the opening to every Thursday night the big-game, primetime feel it deserves. It is a dream scenario for any director.”
Thursday Night Football kicks off Sept. 11 with the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Baltimore Ravens, and ends Week 16 with a double feature of Chargers/49ers, and Eagles/Redskins on Dec. 20.
