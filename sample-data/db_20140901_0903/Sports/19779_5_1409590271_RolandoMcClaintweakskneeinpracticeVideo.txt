Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Rolando McClain has been a nice surprise for the Dallas Cowboys thus far this offseason.&nbsp;For a team that&nbsp;was amongst the worst defensive squads in the league last year, they were in desperate need of a spark especially after losing Sean Lee for the season due to an injury and Orlando Scandrick for four games following his violation of the NFL&rsquo;s substance abuse policy.  McClain was in line to start for the Cowboys at middle linebacker in Week 1 this Sunday, but an injury he incurred today during practice may delay those plans. During &nbsp;a drill today McClain tweaked his knee and pulled up afterwards. Watch the drill and injury in the video below:  The Cowboys can not afford another injury to a defensive player, especially a top notch player like McClain who has played sensational since his return from retirement. Hopefully the injury is nothing serious, and after sitting out a few practices, McClain will be ready to go for Week 1. The Cowboys open up the NFL regular season at home with a tough task as they take on the San Francisco 49ers. In the lead up to the game, one of the major questions will be whether or not Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers offense will have to worry about Rolando McClain.
