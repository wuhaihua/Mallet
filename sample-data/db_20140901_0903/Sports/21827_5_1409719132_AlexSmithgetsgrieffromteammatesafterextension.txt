Alex Smith gets grief from teammates after extension Alex Smith gets grief from teammates after extension Aug 28, 2014; Green Bay, WI, USA; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith (11) warms up before game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

After inking a new four-year, $68 million deal in Kansas City, you better believe Alex Smith is being ridden hard by his fellow Chiefs. If your definition of &ldquo;being ridden hard&rdquo; mostly includes really terrible jokes that anyone can see coming from a mile away (via The Kansas City Star): &ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s part of the deal,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;You better be ready to wear it when you walk in. Everybody (gets on you), the whole team.&rdquo; And the guys had no shortage of material. &ldquo;Well, everybody wants a loan. They want to borrow some money,&rdquo; Smith recalled with a chuckle. &ldquo;(I&rsquo;m paying for) lots of dinners, you&rsquo;re hearing that. &hellip; (They&rsquo;re saying) no one&rsquo;s going to pick up the check again with me. &ldquo;There are already plans of making my locker into &lsquo;The Bank of Alex. They&rsquo;re putting a little ATM machine up in my locker.&rdquo; Sides aching yet? My favorite one was the &ldquo;Bank of Alex&rdquo; line. Whoever came up with that should win some kind of comedy award. Pure genius. They may be yukking it up in Kansas City, but I can name some people out there who don&rsquo;t think the Alex Smith extension is very funny at all. Cam Newton doesn&rsquo;t find it the least bit amusing. Neither does Russell Wilson. Andrew Luck, also not laughing. Those guys may be upset for now, but in the very near future they will be enjoying themselves the same way Alex Smith is currently. It&rsquo;s good to be a quarterback.
