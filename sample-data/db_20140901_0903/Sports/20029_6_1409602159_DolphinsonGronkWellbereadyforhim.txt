Dolphins on Gronk: ‘We’ll be ready for him’ Dolphins on Gronk: ‘We’ll be ready for him’ September 1, 2014, 3:45 pm Joe Philbin knows his Dolphins defense is in for a challenge in the season opener with Rob Gronkowski confirming he was ready to go.
But Philbin said his team was ready before Monday’s Gronknouncement.
“Well, we were fully prepared,” Philbin said Monday in South Florida. “We saw he’s on the 53-man roster, so you have to be prepared for every combination. He’s an excellent player. He’s been a very, very productive player throughout his career. We’ll have a good plan in place, but he’s certainly an important part of their offense, and a productive part of it. We’ll be ready for him, for sure.”
Gronkowski didn’t do much damage to Miami last season, catching two passes for 27 yards in his second game back on the field. He was injured for the second meeting with the Fins.
In 2012, Gronkowski had two catches for 42 yards in the first meeting with the Dolphins and didn’t play in the second meeting.
In his two seasons as Miami coach, Philbin hasn’t gotten an eyeful of Gronk at his best yet. And with the tight end on a pitch count Sunday, he may not see his best this week either.
