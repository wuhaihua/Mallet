                    Brett Lawrie&#39;s season is over.

The Blue Jays announced before Tuesday night&#39;s game at Tampa Bay that the infielder had been transferred from the 15- to the 60-day disabled list.

Lawrie spent six weeks on the disabled list from June to early August with a fractured right index finger. He returned Aug. 5, but left after just three innings with a strained oblique. He&#39;s been out ever since.

&quot;He has suffered a variation of the same injury in each of the last three seasons,&quot; the Toronto Star points out. &quot;By the end of this season the Langley, B.C.-native will have missed 184 games over the last three seasons due to a variety of injuries.

Lawrie ends the season with a .247/.301/.421 slash line, 12 homers and 38 RBIs in 70 games. He has yet to play more than 125 games in a season.

Toronto also activated RHP Brandon Morrow and 1B Dan Johnson from the disabled list.
Morrow had been sidelined because of an injured right finger since early May, while Johnson missed a month with a strained left hamstring.
