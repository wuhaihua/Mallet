Louisville fans spell out an ACC welcome (GIF) Louisville fans spell out an ACC welcome (GIF) Sep 1, 2014; Louisville, KY, USA; Louisville Cardinals head coach Bobby Petrino leads the players through the fans during the Card March prior to their game against the Miami Hurricanes at Papa JohnNCAA Football    The Louisville Cardinals are playing in the fourth conference in 11 years.  The Cardinals left the AAC in favor of the ACC and are playing in the first conference game. They are currently playing host to the Miami Hurricanes. These same teams met back in December in the 2013 Russell Athletic Bowl where the Cardinals absolutely dominated the Hurricanes, dismantling them on their way to a 36-9 victory. A lot has changed since then &ndash; the Hurricanes are starting a true freshman quarterback in Brad Kaaya while the Cardinals have replaced head coach Charlie Strong, who left for the Texas Longhorns, and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who left for the NFL. During the game Monday, the Cardinals fans spelled out a couple of welcome messages.
