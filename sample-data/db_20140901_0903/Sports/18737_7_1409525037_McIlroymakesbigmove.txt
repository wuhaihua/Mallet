			World No 1 Rory McIlroy was in sublime touch as he stormed up the third-round leaderboard at the Deutsche Bank Championship with a flawless seven-under 64 on Sunday.The in-form Northern Irishman collected seven birdies to reach 10-under-par overall, two behind leader Russell Henley.Henley came home in 31 shots for a 65 and is one ahead of his fellow American Billy Horschel (67) heading into Monday's final round at TPC Boston in the second event of the FedEx Cup play-off series.American Chris Kirk (64) and Australia's Jason Day (69) sit a stroke further back, alongside McIlroy, on a packed leaderboard featuring 14 players within five of the lead.McIlroy made an excellent start with birdies at two and three before driving a 132-yard approach to nine feet at the seventh, with a nerveless putt moving him to three under for his round.Two more excellent up and downs at the 13th and 15th left him with simple putts, while he was inches away from acing the 16th, consoling himself by tapping in for his seventh birdie of the day.He passed up a chance to close his round with a flourish after finding the rough with his approach on his final hole, but he saved par and will now fancy his chances heading into Monday's final round.McIlroy has won three of his last four tournaments heading into Boston, having triumphed at the Open Championship, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the US PGA Championship in recent weeks.Speaking after his round, he said on Sky Sports 4: "I converted some more of the chances that I gave myself today. I was pretty frustrated coming off the golf course in the last couple of days because I felt like I left a lot of shots out there."Even today, I felt like I might have left a couple out there, especially on the last. But I'm happy with how I converted those chances and I'm going to need to do the same tomorrow if I'm going to win."
