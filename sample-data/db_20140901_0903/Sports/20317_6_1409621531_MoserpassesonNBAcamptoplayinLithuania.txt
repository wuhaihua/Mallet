Moser passes on NBA camp to play in Lithuania Moser passes on NBA camp to play in Lithuania September 1, 2014, 7:45 pm BOSTON — Mike Moser is no stranger to a change in plans at the last minute.But when it has happened, things have had a way of working out for the former All-America who was a standout performer for the Boston Celtics summer league team in July.That appears to be the case once again as the 6-foot-8 forward has had a change of heart in participating in NBA training camps to instead play for Rytas in Lithuania which is based on Vilnius, Lithuania and plays in EuroCup - the second best league in Europe.No specific details for the deal are available currently, but it has been described as an "extremely lucrative offer" that was too good to pass up.And Moser won't have to concern himself with a buyout because his deal is just for one season."We want to put Mike in the best position to be successful, to achieve his goal which is to play in the NBA," his agent Adam Pensack told CSNNE.com in an earlier interview this summer.An All-America at UNLV (he also played at UCLA prior to that, and finished his collegiate career at Oregon), Moser averaged 13.6 points and 4.8 rebounds in five summer league games with the Celtics.
