The 49ers’ quest to turn Lawrence Okoye into an NFL player will continue.
Okoye, a defensive lineman who had never put on football pads before training camp of 2013, signed with the 49ers’ practice squad on Sunday after clearing waivers, he announced on Twitter.
Okoye (6 foot 6, 304 pounds) saw limited action during the exhibition season after sustaining an ankle sprain in the 49ers’ first game Aug. 7 against the Baltimore Ravens. He recorded one tackle and one quarterback hurry while playing 11 snaps in the 49ers' exhibition finale Thursday against the Houston Texans.
He has been a project for 49ers defensive line coach Jim Tomsula due to his extreme athletic ability. Okoye, a former rugby player, was a finalist for Great Britain in the 2012 Olympics in the discus.
Practice squad players are entitled to a minimum of $6,300 a week.
