DENVER –- The Giants are rolling a family reunion into their September call-ups.
The team plans to purchase the contract of right-hander Brett Bochy, son of manager Bruce Bochy, along with four other additions after Triple-A Fresno plays its season finale on Monday.

The younger Bochy, a 20th-round pick in 2010 out of Kansas, posted a 3.57 ERA in 34 games (two starts), striking out 47 and walking 24 in 53 innings.
He allowed a .263 average in the Pacific Coast League.
The 27-year-old underwent Tommy John surgery shortly after the Giants drafted him and has made steady progress over the past four seasons. He has been in big league camp each of the last two springs.
This isn’t the first time a Giants manager has had his son on the roster. Bochy’s predecessor, Felipe Alou, managed Moises Alou with both the Montreal Expos and Giants.John Shea of the San Francisco Chronicle was first to report the Giants would purchase Brett Bochy's contract.

The Giants also are likely to purchase the contract of right-hander Chris Heston, who had a 2.05 ERA in eight starts after the All-Star break and could provide long relief. They can create 40-man roster space for Heston and Bochy by transferring Matt Cain and Marco Scutaro to the 60-day disabled list.
First baseman Adam Duvall is also expected to be among the second round of call-ups, with outfielders Jarrett Parker and Gary Brown and right-hander Erik Cordier among the other possibilities already on the 40-man roster.
