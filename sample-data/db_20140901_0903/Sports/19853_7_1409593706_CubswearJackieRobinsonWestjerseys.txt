Chicago put these photos up on their Twitter account showing the team wearing jerseys that pay homage to the U.S. represntative in the 2014 LLWS. The team was also in attendance, getting to sit in the dugout and meet players before the game.

The youngsters will also get to throw out the first pitch on Monday and sing &quot;Take me out to the ball game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.
