			David Nicholls has his eye on the feature race at Hamilton Park on Tuesday with his Thirsk raider Layla's Hero.The Paul Mulrennan-ridden course winner faces 13 rivals in the £15,000 Betfair Scottish Sprint Series Final Handicap over six furlongs.Nicholls said: "It's a nice prize and he's in great order and I couldn't be happier with him. He's got the penalty for winning at Catterick the other day so he's in good form. "He's had a good year and always runs his race."We've won with him on good to firm, good to soft and on the all-weather (Southwell) and he doesn't care about the ground as he never checks the weather forecast!"Half of the field are trained in Scotland including Jim Goldie's track winners Go Go Green and Classy Anne while course and distance scorer Mandalay King represents Yorkshire handler Marjorie Fife who boasts a stunning 43 per cent strike-rate at the Lanarkshire venue this term.Kieren Fallon has been booked for three rides including Anastazia in the opening St Andrews Ambulance Nursery Handicap for Paul d'Arcy.
