Bovada: Blackhawks still favored to win 2015 Stanley Cup Bovada: Blackhawks still favored to win 2015 Stanley Cup  We're still weeks from training camp and the Chicago Blackhawks have some work to do in order to address their salary-cap issues before the upcoming campaign begins, but that doesn't mean it's too early to start picking favorites heading into the 2014-15 NHL season. 
Bovada released its updated 2015 Stanley Cup odds, and the Blackhawks are (once again) headlining the charts.

For quite some time now, the Blackhawks have been riding atop Bovada's charts, and there's really no reason to see them drop much before the start of the upcoming campaign. 
Yes, the team will have some roster moves they'll need to make — which will likely happen around the time of training camp — but fans likely won't see too drastic of a change before the season opens. 
But expect to see the Kings continue to remain neck-and-neck with the Blackhawks. Like Chicago in 2013, they're returning the majority of their championship roster, so as more preseason rankings get released in the upcoming weeks, those two will remain in a close race.
