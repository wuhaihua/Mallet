			Joseph O'Brien will ride Gordon Lord Byron in Saturday's Betfred Sprint Cup at Haydock.Trainer Tom Hogan was on the sportinglife Podcast on Monday and said the ride was William Buick's should he be available but it now seems he'll be required for Gregorian.O'Brien, who's dad Aidan has Cougar Mountain in the Group One contest, rode Gordon Lord Byron in his recent comeback race at the Curragh when the pair were touched off by Jamesie in the Renaissance Stakes.However the trainer is confident of a bold showing as he defends his crown at the weekend, saying: "I'm quite confident he's in similar shape to last year. Shane Foley rode him on Sunday in a piece of work having done so before last year's race and thinks he's in top, top form. We'd be very happy with him."
