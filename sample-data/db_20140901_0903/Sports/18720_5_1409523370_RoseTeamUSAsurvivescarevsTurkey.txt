Rose, Team USA survive scare vs. Turkey Rose, Team USA survive scare vs. Turkey  After a dominant win Saturday over Finland in its first FIBA World Cup pool-play game, Bulls point guard Derrick Rose and Team USA survived a legitimate scare against Turkey before pulling away late to win Sunday, 98-77, in Bilbao, Spain.
Team USA had struggled for brief stretches in their exhibition contests, but Turkey, featuring the rebounding prowess of its lone NBA player, ex-Bulls center Omer Asik—traded to New Orleans from Houston this offseason, the 7-footer is a former teammate of Rose and Rockets All-Star shooting guard James Harden, and will pair with Pelicans big man Anthony Davis in the upcoming campaign—slowed the game’s tempo with a 2-3 zone defense, goaded the Americans into poor shot selection and scored enough to end the opening period with the game tied at 16 apiece, despite the energetic two-way play of Denver Nuggets power forward Kenneth Faried.
Rose, who was substituted into the game midway through both the first and second quarters, again backing up starting point guard Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers, failed to make an impact in the first half, scoring a lone point in the first half, and with the rest of his teammates also out of sync teammates, coupled with Turkey continuing to execute its strategy, Team USA faced a surprising 40-35 halftime deficit.

The sharpshooting Turkish squad continued to play its disciplined brand of basketball in the third quarter, but eventually the superior athleticism of the interior duo of Davis and Faried started to take hold offensively, along with timely perimeter contributions from Irving and Harden, greater intensity and a shorter rotation—Rose didn’t play in the period—leading to a 66-60 Team USA lead heading into the final stanza.
The Americans found a rhythm pushing the pace and crashing the offensive glass, while Turkey’s proficient outside shooting was less accurate, leading to a comfortable double-digit advantage early in the fourth quarter and the return of Rose, who failed to hit a field goal as the national team cruised to a rout in which the final score wasn’t indicative of the game’s competitiveness.
