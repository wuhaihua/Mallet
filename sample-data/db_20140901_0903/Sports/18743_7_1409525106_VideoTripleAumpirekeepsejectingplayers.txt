Most of the time, when there are ejections in a professional baseball game, it&rsquo;s obvious who got tossed. On a rainy night in Colorado Springs this week, it wasn&rsquo;t so obvious.

Pacific Coast League umpire Jeff Morrow called out El Paso infielder Tyler Greene on a check swing and the Chihuahuas dugout yelled at Morrow. It appeared Morrow wasn&rsquo;t sure who was saying what, so he started bouncing players haphazardly.

Moments after the rapid fire ejections, the entire El Paso dugout cleared because of a rain delay. An hour and a half later, still in the rain delay, there was still mass confusion on who was thrown out and who wasn&rsquo;t.
