			Andy Murray will look to avenge his Toronto Masters defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga when he meets the Frenchman in the fourth round of the US Open on Monday.Murray had won nine of the 10 previous meetings against Tsonga before he came unstuck against him in three sets last month, despite holding a 3-0 lead in the deciding set."I played a good match," said eighth seed Murray, looking back to the Toronto match."I was up a break in the third set and didn't manage to close it out. So obviously if I get myself in that position again hopefully I'll do a better job of that. But I don't need to change too much."It will be a tough match. We've played each other a lot of times. He's obviously playing well right now. He had a great week in Canada. He's played some good tennis so far here."I've had a lot of close matches with him but I've won a lot against him, as well. I would say (my game) matches up well."Having struggled in the opening round against Robin Haase, Murray has looked much more assured in his wins against Matthias Bachinger and Andrey Kuznetsov.Tsonga, though, is playing with confidence and so far the ninth seed has looked untroubled en route to the fourth round.UpsetThe reward for the winner is a possible quarter-final with former champion Novak Djokovic, with the top seed in action against 22nd seed Philipp Kohlschreiber.Djokovic, who has appeared in the past four finals at Flushing Meadows, has won four of his five encounters against Kohlschreiber.The German, though, has given Djokovic plenty to think about in the past, winning the opening set in the past two meetings.There is the chance of an upset in when third seed Stanislas Wawrinka takes on Tommy Robredo.The 16th seed from Spain enjoys a 6-2 winning record over Wawrinka, however the Swiss did beat him at the same stage en route to the Australian Open title.Rising star Milos Raonic will also be wary of an upset, with the fifth seed taking on 10th-ranked Kei Nishikori.Raonic lost his first two meetings against the 24-year-old from Japan, although he did hit back with a fourth-round victory at Wimbledon this year.In the womenâ€™s draw, Serena Williams will look to continue her march towards a sixth US Open title when she takes on Kaia Kanepi.TroubledThe 32-year-old has never lost to the world No 50 from Estonia, although the last of their three meetings came five years ago.Flavia Pennetta and Casey Dellacqua wait in the quarter-finals for the winner. The 11th seeded Pennetta has beaten the Australian on their only previous meeting and has looked in good form so far in New York.Former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka will look to recapture her top form when she goes up against Aleksandra Krunic.Azarenka has been troubled by a foot injury for a large part of the year and although she showed glimpses of her undoubted talent in Montreal she then missed the Cincinnati tournament with a knee problem.Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard faces a tough task against 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova.Bouchard lost her way following her charge at the All England club, with early defeats at Montreal, Cincinati and New Haven, however she has showed her fighting qualities with three-set wins over Sorana Cirstea and Barbara Zahlavova-Strycova.
