SANTA CLARA -- The 49ers released their first “unofficial” depth chart of the regular season on Tuesday, and it contained one surprise.
Rookie Bruce Ellington is listed as the 49ers’ top returner on kickoffs and punts ahead of LaMichael James. However, it is not known if that is the 49ers’ intention for Sunday’s season opener against the Dallas Cowboys.

In the past, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said Bob Lange, the director of communications, filled out the unofficial depth chart that is distributed to the media.
Linebacker Michael Wilhoite is listed as a starting inside linebacker, along with Patrick Willis. And Dan Skuta is listed as the starter at outside linebacker in place of suspended Aldon Smith. Last season during Smith’s absence, Skuta played base downs and Corey Lemonier entered to rush the passer.
Here’s the complete 49ers depth chart:
