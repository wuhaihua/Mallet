                    FOXBOROUGH, Mass.&nbsp;&mdash; Star tight end Rob Gronkowski stood in front of his Gillette Stadium locker Monday and announced he will be playing in the New England Patriots&#39; opener at Miami this Sunday.

Saying he is &quot;super excited,&quot; Gronkowski vowed to be on the field after he didn&#39;t play in any of the four preseason games as he completed his recovery from December right knee surgery.

Gronkowski, who tore his right ACL and MCL on Dec. 8, is a two-time Pro Bowler and was an All-Pro in 2011. He has 226 catches with 42 touchdowns in 50 regular-season games.

Last season, coming off multiple surgeries and an arm infection, he appeared in seven games, catching 39 passes, four for touchdowns, before going down on a hit by safety T.J. Ward, then of the Cleveland Browns.
