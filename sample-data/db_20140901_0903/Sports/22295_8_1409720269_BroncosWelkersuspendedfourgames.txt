The suspension will begin immediately.Welker will be eligible to return to the Broncos, who have a bye in Week 4, for their Week 6 game at the New York Jets.He is the second Bronco suspended this season. Kicker Matt Prater will also miss the first four games for a violation of the substance policy.Welker has not yet been cleared to player after suffering a concussion Aug. 23 but did participate in individual drills at practice Monday.The most likely option for the offense is that wideout Emmanuel Sanders will play in the slot while Andre Caldwell sees more playing time outside. Welker's absence could also lead to playing time for second-round draft pick Cody Latimer.***Follow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjonesPHOTOS: NFL player suspensions in 2014
