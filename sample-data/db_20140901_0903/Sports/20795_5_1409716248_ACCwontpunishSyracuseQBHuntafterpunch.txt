Mandatory Credit: Rich Barnes-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    According to a report, the Atlantic Coast Conference will not administer any additional punishment to Syracuse quarterback Terrel Hunt after he was ejected from Friday&rsquo;s game against Villanova for punching an opponent.  In the second quarter of Syracuse&rsquo;s 27-26 double-overtime win over their FCS opponent, Hunt punched Villanova linebacker Dillon Lucas and was ejected from the game. Syracuse.com reported Tuesday that the ACC believes the on-field official and the Syracuse program have responded appropriately. From the Syracuse.com report: It was decided that the officials made the correct call on the field, the process taken by SU was appropriate and no additional punishment was merited. After the game, Syracuse coach Scott Shafer said Hunt would not be punished and that competitive players will react sometimes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an emotional game and if you&rsquo;ve never played it, you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to get frickin&rsquo; pummeled,&rdquo; Shafer said. &ldquo;There are people on your back and people talking to you and you react. We&rsquo;ve all done it.&rdquo; On Saturday, Syracuse released a statement from Shafer: &ldquo;Terrel and I have talked regarding his flagrant penalty and he fully understands the behavior is not condoned and regrets his action.&rdquo; Hunt was 10-for-17 passing for 94 yards prior to his ejection. Syracuse is off until Sept. 13, when they visit Central Michigan.
