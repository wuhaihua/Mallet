			Alberto Contador moved into the red jersey at the Vuelta a Espana as former leader Nairo Quintana plummeted down the standings after a heavy crash on stage ten's individual time trial.Quintana was descending from the only climb on the 36.7km course when he overshot a corner, collided with a barrier and was somersaulted over his handlebars.The Movistar rider struggled back to his feet and gingerly mounted a replacement bike, but he continued to haemorrhage time and crossed the line 4min 07sec down on the stage winner, Tony Martin, and 3min 28sec down on Contador, who finished fourth.Chris Froome also endured a difficult day and could only set the tenth-fastest time, 53 seconds down on Contador, while Alejandro Valverde fared slightly better, finishing 22 seconds down on his fellow Spaniard in eighth.The result sees Contador open up a 27-second lead over second-placed Valverde at the top of the general classification, with Rigoberto Uran climbing to third, 59 seconds back, after a riding to an impressive second place on the day.Froome remains fifth overall but falls to 1min 18sec off the red jersey, while Quintanaâ€™s disastrous day sees him sink to 11th, 3min 25sec off the pace, and all but ends his hopes of overall victory.More to followStage ten result1 Tony Martin (Ger) Omega Pharma - Quick-Step, 47:022 Rigoberto Uran (Col) Omega Pharma - Quick-Step, +15secs3 Fabian Cancellara (Swi) Trek Factory Racing, +184 Alberto Contador (Spa) Tinkoff-Saxo, +395 Samuel Sanchez (Spa) BMC Racing, +486 Cadel Evans (Aus) BMC Racing, +497 Vasil Kiryienka (Blr) Team Sky, +588 Alejandro Valverde (Spa) Movistar, +1:019 Jesse Sergent (NZ) Trek Factory Racing, +1:1310 Chris Froome (GB) Team Sky, +1:32Selected others17 Joaquim Rodriguez (Spa) Katusha, +1:4982 Nairo Quintana (Col) Movistar, +4:07General classification1 Alberto Contador (Spa) Tinkoff-Saxo, 36:45:492 Alejandro Valverde (Spa) Movistar, +27secs3 Rigoberto Uran (Col) Omega Pharma - Quick-Step, +594 Winner Anacona (Col) Lampre-Merida, +1:125 Chris Froome (GB) Team Sky, +1:186 Joaquim Rodriguez (Spa) Katusha, +1:377 Samuel Sanchez (Spa) BMC Racing, +1:418 Fabio Aru (Ita) Astana, +2:279 Robert Gesink (Ned) Belkin, +2:3810 Damiano Caruso (Ita) Cannondale, +2:59Selected other 11 Nairo Quintana (Col) Movistar, +3:25
