U.S. Open 2014: Perfect returns help Wozniacki return to Slam semi U.S. Open 2014: Perfect returns help Wozniacki return to Slam semi 
                
                
           
                    NEW YORK &mdash; Caroline&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;knew, as anyone paying attention does, that the woman she played in the U.S. Open quarterfinals, Sara Errani, does not hit booming serves.

And after noticing that Errani&#39;s previous opponent, Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, tried unsuccessfully to pound those soft serves,&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;decided the best course of action was simply to make sure she put those balls in play.

Getting all 34 of Errani&#39;s serves back over the net, and then claiming 26 of those points,&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;parlayed six breaks and a 26-12 total edge in winners into a 6-0, 6-1 victory over the 13th-seeded Errani in a wind-whipped match Tuesday night.

The victory for the 10th-seeded&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;moved her into her first Grand Slam semifinal in three years.

&quot;I learned quite a lot from Lucic the other day. She was going for every return and trying to make winners on every return,&quot;&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;said. &quot;For me, that wasn&#39;t really the game plan today. It was just putting pressure on her from the start, and kind of start the rally from there.&quot;

Italy&#39;s Errani averaged only 65 mph (105 kph) on second serves, and 78 mph (126 kph) on first serves, and that was a problem.

&quot;I hoped she would miss something here and there,&quot; said Errani, who beat Venus Williams in the third round, &quot;but today she practically never missed.&quot;

With the players&#39; towels and spectators&#39; napkins and all sorts of things being tossed around by the stirred-up air,&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;dealt with the conditions far better than Errani. Although not right away.

The match began competitively enough, with a pair of points that lasted more than 20 strokes apiece in the first game. Errani earned four break points before 2009 U.S. Open runner-up&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;eventually held despite a double-fault in which one serve didn&#39;t come close to reaching the net.

&quot;I have played in some very windy conditions here, but I know how to adapt,&quot; said&nbsp;Wozniacki, the runner-up at the U.S. Open in 2009, and a semifinalist in 2011. &quot;It just took me a few serves to kind of get into the rhythm and figure out where to throw the ball and what to aim for.&quot;

Wozniacki, a former No. 1 who eliminated five-time major champion Maria Sharapova in three sets in the fourth round, will face unseeded Peng Shuai of China in the semifinals.

Errani was a finalist at the 2012 French Open, and made it to the final four at that year&#39;s U.S. Open, too.

She&#39;s accustomed to outrunning opponents on court and wearing them down. On this night,&nbsp;Wozniacki&nbsp;&mdash; who has been training to run the New York City Marathon in November for charity &mdash; did that very thing to Errani.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Errani said with a chuckle, &quot;I need to run the marathon, too.&quot;
