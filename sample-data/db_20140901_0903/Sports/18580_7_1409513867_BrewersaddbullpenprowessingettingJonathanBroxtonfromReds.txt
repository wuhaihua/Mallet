                    Jonathan Broxton joined the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday in a trade from the Cincinnati Reds. Object: bolster the bullpen to withstand a September challenge in the National League Central.

Two players will be shipped to the Reds, although they were not named when the trade was made. The Brewers entered Sunday&#39;s game in San Francisco a game ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals in the Central.

Broxton is a right-handed reliever with closing experience and also has been used in set-up and hold situations.

At 30, he likely will be used as the set-up man for closer Francisco Rodriguez. But with Rodriguez struggling in recent games, Broxton offers an option to finish.

Not that Broxton is the perfect solution. Once a dominant presence, he was raked in August and has six blown saves on the season. His ERA of 1.86 is no reflection of recent work.

Carrying a contract that calls for him to be paid $9 million next season, Broxton was stuck behind Reds closer Aroldis Chapman on a team that is headed nowhere. He is 4-2 with a 1.86 earned-run average and 1.01 WHIP in 51 appearances. He is a 10-year veteran and two-time all-star from his days with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Sunday was the deadline for teams to get players in trade and have them eligible for postseason play.
