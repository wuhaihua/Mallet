			Aidan O'Brien could be without a runner in Saturday's Betfred Sprint Cup after ruling Due Diligence out of the Haydock Group One.The three-year-old was last seen when finishing second to Slade Power in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and is one of five possibles for O'Brien at this stage.However, the Ballydoyle handler is not planning to run Due Diligence and may also skip the race with Cougar Mountain, Darwin, Fountain Of Youth and Guerre.He told the Irish Times: "Due Diligence won't run and it's possible we won't have a runner in the race at all."
