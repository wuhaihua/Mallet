The         Cowboys plan to bring         Michael Sam to Dallas for a physical Wednesday, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

     

If all goes well, Sam will be a Cowboy, signed to the team's practice squad, the source said.

Sam, who is seeking to become the first openly gay athlete to play in the NFL, was cut by the         St. Louis Rams on Saturday.

The Rams spent a seventh-round draft pick, No. 249 overall, on him in May's draft. He put together a solid preseason performance, coming up with 11 tackles and three sacks. In Thursday night's preseason finale against Miami, Sam finished his preseason work with a team-high six tackles.

Sam cleared waivers Sunday and is free to sign with any team.

The Rams finalized their 10-player practice squad on Monday, and it did not include Sam.

Coach Jeff Fisher had suggested that a lack of bodies at positions with little depth could leave the defensive end on the outside looking in when the team added to that unit.
