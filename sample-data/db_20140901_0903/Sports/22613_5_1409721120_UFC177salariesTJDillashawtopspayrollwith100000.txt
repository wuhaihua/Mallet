Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY SportsMMA    The UFC 177 salaries have been announced following TJ Dillashaw&rsquo;s successful bantamweight championship defense over Joe Soto at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento, Calif.  According to the California State Athletic Commission,&nbsp;disclosed payroll for the event was $420,000. Topping the payroll was the champion, who brought home $100,000 for his fifth-round knockout win. The next highest payday went to preliminary card fighter Derek Brunson ($44,000) for his win over Lorenz Larking and Tony Ferguson ($40,000) for his co-main event victory over Danny Castillo. The figures do not include the post-fight bonuses that were handed out, so there are four fighters who earned an additional $50,000 on Saturday night &mdash; Carlos Diego Ferreira and Ramsey Nijem (Fight of the Night), Dillashaw (Performance of the Night) and Yancy Medeiros (Performance of the Night). UFC president Dana White also revealed that&nbsp;Anthony Birchak and&nbsp;Scott Jorgensen will be paid their &ldquo;show&rdquo; and &ldquo;win bonus&rdquo; for their bouts that fell through at the last moment.&nbsp; Jorgensen was set to face former Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo on the night&rsquo;s preliminary card, but Cejudo failed to make weight. Birchak was to take on Soto during the prelims, before Renan Barao withdrew from the fight and Soto earned the title shot. Barao and Cejudo will not be paid.
