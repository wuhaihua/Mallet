Dana White: 'There's a Ronda Rousey' on TUF 20 Dana White: 'There's a Ronda Rousey' on TUF 20 MMA    At this point, it has become increasingly difficult to believe anything UFC president Dana White says when hyping an upcoming season of The Ultimate Fighter. Too many times Dana has stated that &ldquo;this season is the best&rdquo;, or there is a potential title challenger in the house when that fails to be the case.  This upcoming season of The Ultimate Fighter, TUF 20, is already one of the most highly anticipated seasons as it will debut the UFC&rsquo;s newest division, the women&rsquo;s strawweights, with 16 of the world&rsquo;s best women competing for the inaugural title. Many of the strawweights are coming from Invicta Fighting Championships, where they proved their worth as UFC fighters. During the UFC 177 post-fight media scrum, Dana discussed TUF 20 and had some high praise for the women. &ldquo;I love this season of &lsquo;The Ultimate Fighter,&rsquo;&rdquo; White told the media Saturday evening. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s way better than the last season of &lsquo;The Ultimate Fighter.&rsquo; &hellip; It&rsquo;s a really good season. The reality is great, but the fights are f***ing awesome, and that&rsquo;s all I really care about.&rdquo; Apparently Dana&rsquo;s pitch was not done, as later on in the media scrum he made a very bold statement in regards to TUF 20. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s MMA has come so far in 13 years,&rdquo; White continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable. You guys are going to be blown away. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a Ronda Rousey on this season of &lsquo;The Ultimate Fighter.&rsquo; Absolutely.&rdquo; Saying there is a &ldquo;Ronda Rousey&rdquo; means that there is not only a potential dominant champion in the house, but she is extremely marketable as well. Rousey knows how to sell herself almost better than any other fighter in the UFC, and her popularity shows it. Now we just have to wait and see who this &ldquo;Rousey&rdquo; is on season 20 of The Ultimate Fighter starting September 10th on Fox Sports 1. [h/t MMAJunkie]
