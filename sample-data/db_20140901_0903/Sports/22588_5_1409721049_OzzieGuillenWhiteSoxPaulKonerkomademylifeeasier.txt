Ozzie Guillen: White Sox Paul Konerko 'made my life easier' Ozzie Guillen: White Sox Paul Konerko 'made my life easier'  The final month of the baseball season has finally arrived and the moment White Sox fans have been preparing themselves for has finally come. It's time to say goodbye to first baseman Paul Konerko as he rides off into the sunset of retirement. 
Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen, who managed Konerko for eight seasons on the South Side, stopped by the AT&amp;T U-verse Lounge to talk about his former slugger.
"Great leader, outstanding guy," Guillen said. "He leads by example. He tended to make my life easier as a manger. He tended to make my life with less pain. That guy, you do not have to worry about him to be on the field, to be worried about him having any problem. He showed up to play, and he knew how to make his teammates better."

Guillen also acknowledged the excitement in Chicago about both teams, the Cubs with all of their young, talented prospects and the White Sox with players like Jose Abreu and Carlos Rodon. While he doesn't doubt that these young stars will have success for both teams in the Windy City, he knows it also won't happen overnight. 
"I think Rick Hahn did a great job," Guillen said. "He cleaned the house. He trade people I never thought you could've traded...Little by little, he's cleaning the house. You've got to be patient with them. I think the Cubs are taking a little bit more excitement because we've been seeing these kids name for the last two or three years. Now, they here in Chicago. I think Theo has a great idea with what he wants to do. Just be patient. But the next year, the team will be a lot better. I might have to give it a couple more years to see a pretty good, young talent back in Chicago."
