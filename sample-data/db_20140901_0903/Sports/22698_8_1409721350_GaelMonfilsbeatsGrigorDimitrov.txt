NEW YORK --         Gael Monfils, a flashy Frenchman known more for his shot-making than results, beat         Grigor Dimitrov 7-5, 7-6 (6), 7-5 on Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals of the US Open for the first time since 2010.

The 20th-seeded Monfils pounded his chest and extended his arms after the seventh-seeded Dimitrov double-faulted on match point.

     

Monfils made two major quarterfinals in a season for the first time in his career. He also advanced that far at the French Open.

Dimitrov broke through to his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon but couldn't follow that up with another deep run.

In an entertaining match, both players made unbelievable gets, including Monfils' shot in the final game that he nearly curled around the net. Dimitrov got it back to win the point. But the match came down to break points: Monfils converted 3 of 4, Dimitrov just 1 of 7.

Monfils moves on to play the winner of the night match between second-seeded         Roger Federer and No. 17-seeded         Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain.

In other men's matches with a spot in the final eight at stake, sixth-seeded         Tomas Berdych meets         Dominic Thiem, and No. 14-seeded         Marin Cilic plays 26th-seeded         Gilles Simon.
