Police in Gilbert, Arizona were called to a Best Buy after Hall was found by an employee stuffing items from the shelves out of boxes into his backpack. When he was caught, he pleaded for mercy from the store, saying that it was the first time that he had ever done anything of that nature, and he would never let it happen again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry. I&rsquo;ll pay for the stuff. If I get arrested, I&rsquo;ll get fired,&rdquo; Hall told the police officer who responded to the store. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done this before.&rdquo; Also, according to the police report, there was no denying on camera that Hall was indeed guilty of the act. &ldquo;I also obtained the video footage from Best Buy that clearly shows Max selecting, opening and concealing items in his backpack and hiding the open boxes,&rdquo; the officer wrote. In addition to committing the theft, there was also traces amounts of cocaine found in his possession, which further add to the legal woes he was already facing with the shoplifting. Hall spent three years as the BYU quarterback from 2007-09, throwing for 11,365 yards and 94 touchdowns.
