Cleveland Cavaliers rumors: Cavs interested in JaVale Mcgee? Cleveland Cavaliers rumors: Cavs interested in JaVale Mcgee? Nov 7, 2013; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Nuggets center JaVale McGee (34) reacts during the first half against the Atlanta Hawks at Pepsi Center. Mandatory Credit: Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY SportsNBA    It is pretty clear the Cleveland Cavaliers would like to add a big man to protect the rim and many believe that could be their final step before becoming the league&rsquo;s best team. They have reportedly targeted Denver Nuggets&rsquo; big man Timofey Mozgov and even offered a first round pick for him.  Although all of the speculation surrounds Mozgov, Kevin Pelton of ESPN.com doesn&rsquo;t see it happening. Instead, he could see the Nuggets and Cavaliers pull off a different deal. I still haven&rsquo;t seen someone explain why the Nuggets would do that trade. So until then, no. If the Cavaliers and Nuggets make a trade, my money is on JaVale McGee for Brendan Haywood&rsquo;s instant expiring next summer. McGee would obviously help any Cavaliers&rsquo; problems with rebounding and shot-blocking. Plus, the team may think he is worth the risk provided he is healthy because of the structured environment he&rsquo;d be in with James as a leader. McGee was limited to just five games last season, averaging 7.0 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game while shooting 44.7% from the field and 100.0% from the free throw line. In his six professional seasons, he&rsquo;s put up 8.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game while shooting 54.1% from the floor and 58.4% from the charity stripe.&nbsp;Mozgov took McGee&rsquo;s spot and went for 9.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game. He shot 52.3% from the field and 75.4% from the free throw line. In his four-year career, he&rsquo;s gone for 6.0 points,, 4.4 rebounds and 0.9 blocks per game while shooting 51.5% from the floor and 73.9% from the charity stripe.
