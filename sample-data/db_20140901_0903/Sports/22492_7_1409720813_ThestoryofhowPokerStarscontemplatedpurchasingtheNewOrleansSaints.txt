                    In a recent blog post, poker patriarch Nolan Dalla&nbsp;revealed that online poker room&nbsp;PokerStars held serious discussions about acquring the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League almost 10 years ago.&nbsp;


&quot;One of the wackiest poker stories never&nbsp;yet told took place in early 2006, about six months after Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans and flooded most of the city.&quot;




The Saints had just spent a year playing on the road due to damages to the Superdome, where the Saints played their home games. Word on the street was that Saints owner Tom Benson was looking to sell the team. It&#39;s important to remember that the club had been terrible to this point, having won just a single playoff game in their history at that time - prior to&nbsp;the beginning of the&nbsp;Sean Payton-Drew Brees era.

Although PokerStars knew that the NFL would more than likely automatically reject their bid to attempt to purchase the Saints (given the that league prefers to stay distance themselves from any form of gambling) the publicity that their attempted purchase would garner would earn the company, based on the Isle of Man,&nbsp;tens of millions of dollars.

The proposal was taken seriously inside the walls of PokerStars but in the end, company founder and majority owner&nbsp;Isai&nbsp;Scheinberg, decided to pass on the radical proposal put forward by Dalla.

One can just imagine how fun things could have gotten had Benson accepted the proposal and how the NFL would have dealt with the matter!

Dalla,&nbsp;senior writer for WSOP.com and one of the hard working men behind the Poker Night in America project, served as Director of Communications for&nbsp;PokerStars&nbsp;between 2004 and 2006.
