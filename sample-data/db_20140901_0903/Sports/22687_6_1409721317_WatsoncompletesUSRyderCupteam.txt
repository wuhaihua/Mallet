Watson completes US Ryder Cup team Watson completes US Ryder Cup team  There was an unmistakable theme Tuesday night with U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson’s three wild-card picks. 
Redemption.
Live from NBC’s famous Studio 8H – the home of “Saturday Night Live” in New York City – Watson announced that Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson would round out the 12-man team that likely will be a significant underdog when the biennial matches begin Sept. 26-28 in Scotland.
Bradley, 28, seemed destined for a pick months ago. Though winless since August 2012, he recorded six top-10 finishes this season and possesses the kind of aerial attack that should play well at Gleneagles. Still fresh in many fans’ minds is Bradley’s spirited play alongside Phil Mickelson during the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah, when the duo combined to go 3-0 while energizing the crowd.
It still wasn’t enough for a U.S. victory, as the Americans saw a 10-6 lead disappear on the final day in one of the most dramatic finishes in tournament history. 
“I made no secret of how important this team is to me, and how bad I want to go back and win the Ryder Cup,” Bradley said. “This is a redemption year for guys who were on the team (in 2012). It’s going to be an unbelievable trip over to Scotland.”
