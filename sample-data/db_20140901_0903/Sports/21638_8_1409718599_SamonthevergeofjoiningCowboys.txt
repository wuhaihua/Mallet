Sam on the verge of joining Cowboys Sam on the verge of joining Cowboys Michael Sam has apparently found his next NFL job with the Dallas Cowboys.Sam, the defensive end seeking to become the NFL's first openly gay player, will undergo a physical at the Cowboys headquarters on Wednesday, with the team poised to sign him to their 10-man practice squad, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.It would create an intriguing mix with Sam joining arguably the NFL's highest-profiled franchise amid the enormous presence he has enjoyed for his social statement.The St. Louis Rams released the seventh-round pick on their final cut-down to 53 players on Saturday. But despite posting a team-high three sacks in preseason, Sam went unclaimed by the other 31 NFL teams and the Rams did not re-sign him to the practice squad.Yet the Cowboys could use the help for their injury-depleted defense that is challenged to improve after ranking last in the NFL in 2013.Of the 41 players drafted in the seventh-round in May, only eight were unsigned on Tuesday, including Sam. Twenty-one seventh-round picks made their team's 53-man roster out of training, while six others were already signed to a practice squads, and six were on injury-related reserve lists (injured reserve, reserve-physically unable to perform, or reserve-non football injury).***Follow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBellVIDEO: NFC East preview
