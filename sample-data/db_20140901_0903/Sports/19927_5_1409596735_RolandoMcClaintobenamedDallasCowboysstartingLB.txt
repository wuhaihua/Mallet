Many suggested the signing of the&nbsp; two-time retired, 24-year-old linebacker was a pointless move. However, with the Cowboys so strapped on the defensive end and their depth at linebacker non-existent, what was the risk? That was thinking of the front office who gave the former 8th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft an opportunity. If he continued his sub-par play, he was a relatively easy cut. But what if he didn&rsquo;t? Well, we now know the answer as not only did Rolando McClain make the Dallas Cowboys&rsquo; final 53-man roster, he&rsquo;s also set to become their starting middle linebacker. Bruce Carter says he&rsquo;s starting strong side LB with Rolando McClain at MLB and Justin Durant weak side. #Cowboys &mdash; Drew Davison (@drewdavison) September 1, 2014  McClain has played very well during the preseason and has shown flashes of what made him a top ten pick. Of course, consistency is an issue for the defender and it remains to be seen if he can continue his strong play through the season. That said, McClain couldn&rsquo;t have walked into a better situation thanks to Dallas&rsquo; lack of depth and he&rsquo;s almost assured of keeping the gig assuming he can keep his motor going at a high level. For the Dallas Cowboys, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain with McClain. If he can ever harness his ability and channel his energy, his talent will make him a very solid linebacker. Ability has never been a question for Rolando McClain, so hopefully he can prove himself to be more of a late bloomer than a bust.
