Mandatory Credit: Melina Vastola-USA TODAY SportsDaily Sports Picks    September shapes up to be a great month of Streak for the Cash action. The month features some of the most exciting and jam-packed boards of the year including the start of the NFL season, the last month of pennant race Major League Baseball, plenty of early season college football, the FedEx Cup, the 2014 FIBA World Cup, and of course some European soccer to get us started with daytime picks. Labor Day gets us off to a good start with 19 picks on the board running throughout the day. The first pick of the month is usually one with a heavy favorite and this month is no exception with the Bryan Brothers on tap to get us started at 11:08 this morning. &nbsp;This afternoon, there are some nice picks from afternoon baseball, the final round of the Deutsche Bank Open, a CFL game in Hamilton, and a FIBA World Cup basketball game between Brazil and Spain. Tonight, there is some more tennis action along with a nice college football game and an important National League showdown between the Nats and Dodgers. Here are my picks to start the month with my confidence in each pick on a scale of 1-10 included with each pick. 9/1 Streak Picks Aug 30, 2014; New York, NY, USA; Mike Bryan (USA) returns to Jared Donaldson (USA) and Michael Russell (USA) on the Grandstand Court on day six of the 2014 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
