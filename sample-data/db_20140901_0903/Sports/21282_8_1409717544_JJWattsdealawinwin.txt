J.J. Watt's deal a win-win J.J. Watt's deal a win-win Today&#8217;s big winner: J.J. Watt
The Houston Texans officially didn&#8217;t need to get a deal done.
With the 2012 NFL Defensive Player of the Year under contract for two more seasons (and potentially more if the team were to franchise him in 2016), the Texans could have very easily gone into the 2014 season by pushing any future negotiations with their star defensive end further down the road.
After all, with the first regular season game just five days away and a new coaching staff, new quarterback and several other new starters all in the process of forging who the Houston Texans are going to be this year, it would have been very easy for owner Bob McNair and general manager Rick Smith to see Watt as one of the few areas on this team that didn&#8217;t need to be addressed coming off of last year&#8217;s 2-14 debacle.
It&#8217;s a credit to both the team and the player that the Texans decided to reward their superstar anyway, signing Watt to a six-year extension worth $100 million, with $51.8 million guaranteed. If Watt, who now becomes the highest paid defensive player in the NFL, plays out the duration of the contract, he&#8217;ll be in Houston through the 2021 season.
It was a rare show of good faith that isn&#8217;t particularly common in the business climate of today&#8217;s NFL. Watt, who established himself as a superstar with his breakout sophomore season in 2012, could have opted to hold out heading into this year&#8217;s training camp. He&#8217;s certainly proved his value to the team in his first three seasons, one that&#8217;s significantly higher than the four-year, $11.2 million rookie deal he has been playing under.
He&#8217;s also been a formidable asset to the Texans off the field. Now entering his fourth season, Watt has eclipsed Andre Johnson as the face of the franchise on a national scale, while sharing the star receiver&#8217;s proclivity to get involved in the community. Watt has championed literacy causes, stood up for a young fan, &#8220;proposed&#8221; to a sad six-year-old and performed a handful of generous actions meant to brighten the lives of kids and other Texans fans.
Watt has been everything the team could have wanted him to be since they selected him with the 11th overall pick out of Wisconsin in 2011.
The Texans could have dragged their feet on giving him a contract that appropriately reflects his value. Watt could have skipped minicamp or held out of the first few weeks of training camp as a show of frustration. Instead both sides trusted that they&#8217;d be able to get something done and they did, without the contract situation ever becoming a source of contention.
Watt now gets paid what he deserves and the Texans and their fans get the security of knowing that the best pass rusher in the NFL will be anchored in Houston for the next eight seasons if all goes well.
That seems like a win-win for everyone.
