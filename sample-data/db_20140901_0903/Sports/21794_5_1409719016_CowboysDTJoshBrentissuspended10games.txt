Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent has been away from the NFL since a drunk driving car accident killed his teammate Jerry Brown Jr. Since then Brent has spent time behind bars, in treatment centers and is ready to make his return to the NFL. The only thing left was for the NFL to figure out what they were going to do with him. The league handed down their ruling on Tuesday, suspending Brent for nine games according to NFL Media insider Ian Rapoport. #Cowboys DT Josh Brent is suspended 10 games. Eligible to visit the facility after Week 6. Week 9, he can practice. &mdash; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 2, 2014 It comes with conditions as well.   If #Cowboys DT Josh Brent has any alcohol-related conduct or activity, he faces immediate suspension, maybe banishment from @NFL &mdash; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 2, 2014   The conditions seem reasonable considering the circumstances. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones isn&rsquo;t ready to give up on Brent either, and said that there would be a roster spot for Brent on the Cowboys, who need help along the defensive line. The Cowboys run a different defensive base since Brent was last on the team, and head coach Jason Garrett said he has a plan on how to use Brent. &ldquo;Those guys in a 3-4 play what we call a 0-nose, where you play head up and sometimes in a 3-4 scheme you play on the edge of that center,&rdquo; Garrett said, via the Dallas Morning News. &ldquo;So we play both in this scheme. We&rsquo;ll play a 0-nose in our four-man line and we&rsquo;ll also play off of that nose a little bit, shaded, so he&rsquo;s done that as part of his experience both at the pro level and the college level.&rdquo;
