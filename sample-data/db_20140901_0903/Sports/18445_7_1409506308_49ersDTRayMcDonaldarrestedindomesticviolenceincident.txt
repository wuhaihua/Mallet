                    Due to the NFL&#39;s recently instituted penalty guidelines for domestic violence, the 49ers likely just lost another piece of its dwindling defense.

Police in Northern California say defensive tackle Ray McDonald, who&#39;s started every game he&#39;s played in San Francisco over the last three seasons, was arrested for domestic violence and taken into custody&nbsp;early Sunday morning after officers responded to a home in an upscale neighborhood.

Under the league&#39;s new policy, first-time domestic violence offenders will be suspended six games. Second-time offenders will be hit with a lifetime ban.

Ex-49ers safety Donte Whitner recently told SFgate.com that coach Jim Harbaugh does not tolerate such incidents.

&quot;He said that we can do anything in the world and we can come and talk to him and he&rsquo;ll forgive us except put our hands on women,&quot;&nbsp;Whitner said of Harbaugh. &quot;If you put your hand on a woman, then you&rsquo;re done in his book.&quot;

If (when) McDonald is handed his six-game penalty, it&#39;s a big hit to the 49ers, whose defense&nbsp;is already without&nbsp;Aldon Smith for nine games. Further,&nbsp;linebacker&nbsp;NaVorro Bowman&nbsp;will miss half the season on the PUP list while recovering from a nasty knee injury.

Smith and Bowman are bigger losses, but in McDonald the 49ers lose their defensive lineman who was on the field for the second-most snaps in 2013.
