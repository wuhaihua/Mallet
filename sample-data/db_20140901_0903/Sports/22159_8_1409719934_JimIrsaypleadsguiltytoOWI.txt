NOBLESVILLE, Ind. --          Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay pleaded guilty Tuesday to one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

     

The 55-year-old Irsay, who refused comment as he made his way down the steps in back of the Hamilton County courthouse, will also be on probation for a year, during which he'll be tested for drugs. His driver's license was also suspended for a year.

According to courtroom evidence, Irsay had the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone in his system when he was arrested on two misdemeanor charges after a traffic stop on March 16.

Reaching a plea agreement now allows NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to begin rendering punishment for Irsay.

Irsay was arrested near his home in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel after he was spotted driving slowly, stopping in the roadway and failing to use a turn signal. Officers said he had trouble reciting the alphabet and failed other field sobriety tests.

A police report said various prescription drugs were found in his vehicle, along with more than $29,000 in cash.

The Colts visit the Denver Broncos on Sunday night to open the season.
