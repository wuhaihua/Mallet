Why did Gronk spill the beans? Why did Gronk spill the beans? September 1, 2014, 1:15 pm FOXBORO -- When Rob Gronkowski strutted through the locker room Monday morning, I had the feeling he’d be talking.
I was a little surprised at his answer to my question of whether or not he’d be good for the opener.
“Yup, I am. I’m good to go. I’ll be playing,” Gronkowski said, grinning proudly.
For a team that likes to drag out the suspense, this is a departure. Why give the Dolphins advance notice of who they’ll be dealing with? 
Three possible reasons:
1. The Patriots didn’t feel like having GronkDrama ’14 play out all week after last year’s breathless reports for the first six weeks of the year.
2. Gronk went off his own script.
3. The Patriots feel that dropping this news out there now makes Miami have to delve into 2013 film to see what they’ll be looking at Sunday.
When Rob Gronkowski made his 2013 debut against the Jets, he played 51 of 79 plays.
How much can he play in the opener against Miami?
“Probably not every snap,” he acknowledged. “Just get out there, get my feet wet and whatever coaches have, just be out there and do it.”
Gronkowski is not a complicated man. As such, he does little to disguise his exuberance. He was happy.
“Super excited,” he said. “Just seeing my teammates grind all week to go back out there with them, get back in the huddle, break the huddle with them. It’s gonna be an honor to be back out there with my teammates. Super-pumped, super-excited and just getting ready for the game.”
Asked about his progress as he comes back for the ACL injury suffered last December, Gronk said, “I feel mentally and physically ready for sure. No doubt about it. The last few weeks, everything’s been going well, no setbacks (doing) more and more every single day and just taking it week-by-week, day-by-day.
“My mentality now is I’m ready to go, I’m ready to be out there, I’m ready to hit, I’m ready to start going.”  FOXBORO -- When Rob Gronkowski strutted through the locker room Monday morning, I had the feeling he’d be talking.
