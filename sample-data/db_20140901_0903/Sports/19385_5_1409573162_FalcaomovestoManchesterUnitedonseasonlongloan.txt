However, one of the biggest moves on the final day of the transfer window is also one of the moves that has been rumored to be happening the longest.  According to multiple reports, 28-year-old striker Radamel Falcao is moving from Monaco to Manchester United of the English Premier League on a season-long loan deal. The Guardian in the UK is reporting that the loan deal sends &pound;6 million to Monaco, and that Manchester United will pay a substantial part of Falcao&rsquo;s &pound;300,000 a week in wages. It&rsquo;s an interesting move for the Red Devils, as Louis Van Gaal loves to play a straight 4-4-2 system and already features strikers Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie. Some may see the move as an insurance policy for Van Persie, who has a messy history of injuries. Yet, Falcao is coming off a knee injury that knocked him out of the World Cup this summer for his native Columbia. Falcao has never had a long-term home since moving from River Plate in Argentina to Europe. Yet, he&rsquo;s been a huge goal-scoring threat &mdash; scoring 153 goals in all competitions since his 2009 move to Porto. Adding Falcao to the mix also signals the end of Javier Hernandez&rsquo;s time at Old Trafford. Interestingly enough, Hernandez is rumored to be taking a medical for a transfer at Real Madrid.
