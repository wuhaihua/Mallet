Chelsea swoop for Remy Chelsea swoop for Remy 
France striker Loic Remy has joined Chelsea from QPR, little more than a month after a proposed switch to Liverpool fell through.Remy appeared set to join Liverpool in July, only for Brendan Rodgers' side to pull the plug on the deal amid reports of the 27-year-old failing a medical.
However, that has not dissuaded Chelsea from making a move for a player who scored 14 Premier League goals in 26 appearances when on loan at Newcastle United last season.
Having agreed to let Fernando Torres move to Milan on a two-year loan, Chelsea were keen to bring in an additional centre-forward to compete with Diego Costa and Didier Drogba.
And Remy has penned a four-year deal at Stamford Bridge. 
"I feel very happy and very proud," said the forward. 
"When I heard Chelsea wanted to sign me I said 'let's go' straight away because they are one of the best clubs in the world. 
"I remember the amazing atmosphere at Stamford Bridge when I played there for Marseille and I can't wait to play for the first time in front of my new fans."
Remy played 16 games in total for QPR, netting six goals.
