Dallas perfect place for Sam to grow Dallas perfect place for Sam to grow It looks like Michael Sam will get his NFL shot after all.
According to several reports, Sam, the first openly gay man to be drafted into the NFL, is on the verge of signing a deal to be on the Dallas Cowboys practice squad. The move comes days after Sam failed to make the St. Louis Rams 53-man roster.
Some will say that Sam is only being signed to the Cowboys because owner Jerry Jones loves to make a splash and craves the attention. This is a man who had to be physically prevented from drafting Johnny Manziel, after all.
Who knows what Jones&#8217; motives are. What is undeniably clear is that the Dallas Cowboys&#8217; defense needs help, and Sam should have every opportunity to shine in Dallas.

Sam was never going to play for the Rams, because he was joining an organization that was loaded at his position. He did every thing they asked, he got a fair shake, but he wasn&#8217;t cracking that roster. There was too much talent in front of him.
In Dallas, that won&#8217;t be an issue. The team was ranked 30th in weighted defense by Football Outsiders last year. There are only 32 teams in the NFL, which is a nice bit of proof that the Cowboys were not very good at the whole defending thing last year.
On top of that, the rookie defensive end the Cowboys did draft, Ben Gardner, is having shoulder surgery and was placed on the injured reserve. The team is thin on defense and Sam could easily break his way into the 53-man roster.
A lot of people were upset when the Rams didn&#8217;t sign Sam to a practice roster, but by cutting him and allowing him the freedom to explore other options, he might end up on a team that really needs him.
