Would LeBron James leave the Cleveland Cavaliers? Would LeBron James leave the Cleveland Cavaliers?

Mandatory Credit: Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsNBA    LeBron James surprised many when he decided to leave the Miami Heat in favor of a return to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he left to join the Heat back in 2010. The Cavaliers have since added power forward Kevin Love and it looks like they will be a true contender for some time.  However, James signed only a two-year deal and can get out of the contract after just one year. Chuck Myron of Hoops Rumors believes there is a chance, albeit small, James could leave again. Sure, there&rsquo;s absolutely a chance. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very good one, but with so many unknowns surrounding a bunch of new teammates and a rookie coach (and a GM who&rsquo;s been on the job for less than a year), you can&rsquo;t rule anything out. Ultimately, I think a team would have to give him a real compelling reason to leave, and I&rsquo;m not sure any of those five franchises you mention has what it takes to give him that. Although Myron brings up a couple of good points, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to see James leaving Cleveland again, especially with the letter he wrote announcing his return his &ldquo;home.&rdquo; In fact, it would be downright shocking if James left the Cavaliers for a second time. James averaged 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.6 steals per game while shooting 56.7% from the field, 37.9% from three and 75.0% from the charity stripe&nbsp;last&nbsp;season. In the playoffs, he went for 27.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game while shooting 56.5% from the floor, 40.7% from beyond the arc and 80.6% from the free throw line. In his career, he&rsquo;s gone for 27.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.7 steals per game while shooting 49.7% from the field, 34.1% from beyond the arc and 74.7% from the charity stripe.
