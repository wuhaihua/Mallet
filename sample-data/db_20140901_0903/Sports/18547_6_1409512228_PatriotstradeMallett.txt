Patriots trade Mallett Patriots trade Mallett August 31, 2014, 1:30 pm Ryan Mallett has been traded to the Houston Texans, according to multiple reports.
Reports have the Patriots acquiring a late-round pick in return.
Speculation about Mallett's near future with the Patriots started when the team drafted Jimmy Garoppolo in the 2nd round of the 2014 NFL Draft.
It grew even more when Garoppolo outplayed Mallett during the team's preseason games, to the point where many expected Mallett to be cut on Saturday if the team couldn't find a trade partner. He wasn't cut, however, and on Sunday morning Bill Belichick talked about the team having three good players at the quarterback position.
But now it appears the Patriots were just waiting things out.
There had been rumors and reports for months that the Texans were a very possible destination for Mallett, as he could play under former Patriots offensive coordinator and now Texans head coach Bill O'Brien.
Rapoport was first to report the Mallett trade.
