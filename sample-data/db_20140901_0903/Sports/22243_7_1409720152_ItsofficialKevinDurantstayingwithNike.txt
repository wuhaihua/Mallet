                    OKLAHOMA CITY &mdash; Kevin Durant is staying with Nike.

Nike spokesman Heter Myers confirmed that Durant will remain with the shoe giant. Myers said in a statement that Nike is &quot;pleased to extend our relationship with Kevin Durant, one of the most exciting players in the game.&quot; Nike did not release terms of the deal.



Under Armour had reportedly offered the Oklahoma City Thunder star a major deal. Durant said on Twitter that he is &quot;Excited and humbled to sign back with the swoosh!&quot;

Durant signed with Nike in 2007, right about the time he was drafted in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics. His KD shoes have been popular since the first was released in 2009. Durant has since blossomed, winning the league MVP award in 2014.
