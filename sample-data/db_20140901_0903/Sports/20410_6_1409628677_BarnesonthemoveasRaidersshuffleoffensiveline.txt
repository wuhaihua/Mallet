ALAMEDA – Khalif Barnes has moved around the offensive line.
His NFL career started at left tackle. After a few years, he switched over to the right. He went back to the left again last season when Jared Veldheer was lost with a triceps tear. He volunteered to move to left guard when Veldheer returned.

The Raiders had him stay there this preseason. Then, last week, they moved him back to right tackle.
That’s where he’ll be on Sunday at the New York Jets. He takes a starting spot from Menelik Watson and allows rookie third-round pick Gabe Jackson to slide in at left guard.
The Raiders went with that lineup in the preseason finale against Seattle, and have chosen to stick with it for the regular-season opener.
“Today I was at right tackle. Who knows about tomorrow,” Barnes said with a smile. “Honestly, though, I’ll play wherever they need me to.”
