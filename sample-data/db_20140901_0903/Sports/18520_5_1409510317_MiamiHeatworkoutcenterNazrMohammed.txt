Miami Heat work out center Nazr Mohammed Miami Heat work out center Nazr Mohammed May 10, 2013; Chicago, IL, USA; Chicago Bulls center Nazr Mohammed (48) in the team huddle during the second quarter in game three of the second round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs against the Miami Heat at the United Center. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Had Greg Oden stayed out of trouble this offseason, there was a strong possibility he could have been re-signed by the Miami Heat.  However, the oft-injured former No. 1 overall pick is now facing potential jail time after alleged legal issues and understandably the Heat want nothing to do with him. Somebody they may have interest in though is veteran big man Nazr Mohammed. The longtime Atlanta Hawks center most recently played with the Chicago Bulls and not only met with the Miami Heat recently, but also worked out for the coaching staff and front office. The Heat, looking to add another veteran backup center, summoned 6-11 Nazr Mohammed, 34, for a workout and meeting with team executives on Thursday. Mohammed, who has career averages of 5.9 points and&nbsp;4.8 rebounds, played in 80 games for the Bulls last season. If the Heat were to bring Nazr Mohammed aboard, he&rsquo;d likely fill in off the bench. That said, even though Mohammed is sub-par on the offensive end he can still play on the defensive side of the ball and would be a solid addition in terms of clogging up the middle &ndash; something the Heat are in need of. The Miami Heat don&rsquo;t have anything to offer outside of a veteran minimum contract, though given the lack of interest surrounding Mohammed, it doesn&rsquo;t seem as if money will be a major issue. There is no word on if the Heat liked what they saw from Nazr Mohammed, who spent his last two seasons with the Chicago Bulls.
