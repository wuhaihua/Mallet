Wakeup Call: Manny's being a different Manny Wakeup Call: Manny's being a different Manny September 2, 2014, 8:00 am Here's your wakeup call -- a combination of newsworthy and/or interesting tidbits -- for Tuesday, September 2:
BASEBALL
All right. Who are you, and what have you done with Manny Ramirez? (NBC's Hardball Talk)
That combined no-hitter by four Phillies pitchers had three of them very excited. But our boy Pap? Not so much. (CSN Philly)
Sounds like Bo Porter never read the sign Billy Martin used to have on his desk: "Rule No. 1: The boss is always right. Rule No. 2: When the boss is wrong, see Rule No. 1." Of course, Martin never paid much attention to it, either. (CSN Houston)
Welcome to Oakland, Adam Dunn! (CSN Bay Area)
Dunn calls leaving the White Sox to join the A's "a very, very easy decision" . . . and, since he's never been to the postseason in his 14-year career, why wouldn't it be? (CSN Chicago)
The Cardinals hadn't spent any days in first place all year -- sorry, Dan Duquette -- but they're there now. (AP)
This is why Red Sox Nation is lusting after Giancarlo Stanton, in case you didn't know. (AP)
First he complains because not enough fans show up, then he says his players get too nervous when there's a sellout crowd. Make up your mind, Ned Yost. (Hardball Talk)
The Reds' season is just about over, so they've decided to shut down Homer Bailey. (AP)
Joc Pederson, who was on the Sox' radar when they were shopping Jon Lester, gets called up by the Dodgers. (Hardball Talk)
Jesus Montero's miserable season comes to an end in the only way it could: With a remainder-of-the-year suspension for actions that were "unacceptable" and "embarrassing." That'll teach you not to throw ice-cream sandwiches at a cross-checker who's ragging on you because you're fat, Jesus. (AP)
Somewhere, Iron Man McGinnity is smiling: Two Japanese high school pitchers throw complete games in a 50-inning, four-day playoff in which one of them threw 709 pitches and the other 689. (Hardball Talk)
COLLEGE BASKETBALL
Tom Izzo found out that Lance Bennett, the caddy for PGA pro Matt Kuchar, is a big Michigan State fan. So when Bennett's wife died unexpectedly last weekend, Izzo called to give his condolences. (NBC's College Basketball Talk)
Arizona State extends the contracts of both men's coach Herb Sendek and women's coach Charli Turner Thorne. (AP)
COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Welcome to the ACC, Louisville! Although I'm sure Miami wishes you'd stayed in the American. (AP)
That's why Cardinals Nation loves Bobby Petrino, even though no one else does. (Yahoo! Sports)
Well, don't worry, I'm sure they learned their lesson: Florida coach Will Muschamp reinstates receiver Demarcus Robinson and defensive tackles Darious Cummings and Jay-nard Bostwick after they were suspended for the season-opening game against Eastern Michigan. The game was halted almost immediately after it started because of unsafe field conditions caused by a heavy rain, so their punishments lasted approximately 10 seconds. (AP)
Bet Marcus Baugh wishes he played for Muschamp and not Urban Meyer. The Ohio State tight end is serving a two-game suspension for what Meyer succinctly describes as "stuff". (NBC's College Football Talk)
Texas quarterback David Ash, who missed most of last season because of concussion symptoms, won't play this week against BYU because of headaches and dizziness suffered after the Longhorns' season-opening win over North Texas. (AP)

Minnesota may not be anyone's idea of NBA paradise, but, as far as Thaddeus Young is concerned, it sure beats Philadelphia. (CSN Philly)
Derrick Rose says he feels good after his first back-to-back games in two years. (NBC's Pro Basketball Talk)
The Heat gets ready for the post-LeBron Era by reshuffling its coaching staff. (Pro Basketball Talk)
And by bringing in Nazr Mohammed . . . maybe. (CSN Chicago)
PRO FOOTBALL
Ray McDonald -- the first player arrested on a domestic-violence charge after the NFL instituted tough new rules against that offense -- says he's "a good-hearted person" and that, even though he can't say much right now, "the truth will come out." (NBC's Pro Football Talk)
As expected, the Rams didn't put Michael Sam on their practice squad. (AP)
Looks like there will be a rookie quarterback starting this week, but you're forgiven if you didn't guess it'd be Derek Carr. (CSN Bay Area)
Jerry Jones is usually talking Super Bowl at this time of year. So for him to say his Cowboys face "an uphill battle" . . . well, it may be a long year in Dallas. (AP)
Sammy Watkins still has sore ribs, but he insists he'll be able to play Sunday when the Bills face the Bears. (AP)
Cam Newton's wearing a flak jacket to protect the ribs he injured against the Patriots two weeks ago, and the Panthers expect him to play Sunday at Tampa Bay. (AP)
And he may be throwing to former Jet Stephen Hill if he does. (Pro Football Talk)
Odell Beckham Jr., the Giants' first-round pick, may be sidelined for as long as three weeks because of his hamstring injury. (AP)

In case you missed it -- and you should have, since the match ended at 2:26 a.m. -- Japan's Kei Nishikori rallied for a five-set victory over fifth-seeded Milos Raonic to reach his first U.S. Open quarterfinal. (AP)  Here's your wakeup call -- a combination of newsworthy and/or interesting tidbits -- for Tuesday, September 2:
