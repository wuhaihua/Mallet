See Marshawn Lynch's new Skittles video See Marshawn Lynch's new Skittles video Marshawn Lynch&#8217;s love for Skittles is well documented, so with the new NFL season coming up, he&#8217;s been stocking up on what is basically his version of a superfood. In a new online video for the candy, Lynch uses his favorite snack as motivation, which we think is probably pretty close to what he actually does during workouts.
In an official quote provided to For The Win, the Seahawks player said &#8220;Skittles and I are getting ready for all that action, boss.&#8221;
Lynch signed a deal with Skittles during the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl earlier this year after a long history of him being showered with the candy after scoring touchdowns.
During the NFL offseason, the candy became an official sponsor of the NFL as well.
