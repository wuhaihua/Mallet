Rooney's misery to Wenger's denial: Five brutal facts from the Premier League Rooney's misery to Wenger's denial: Five brutal facts from the Premier League 
										
		Ten matches, 32 goals, seven results, three draws and six games which saw three or more goals scored. Premier League's third gameweek is over and here are five brutal facts that emerged from it.
- Wayne Rooney's misery: He's captain of England and Manchester United, gets paid &pound;300,000 a week and took zero shots against Burnley. His cross accuracy was 0%, his passing accuracy was 64% and he completed only 33.33% of all his take-ons. He was also nut-megged. Woeful. Simply woeful.

- Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas are brilliant buys: It's quite a stunning record &mdash; over the past three seasons Costa has never lost a game in which he has scored in (scored in 33 games, 33 wins). He's already got four goals for Chelsea in three matches &mdash; to put that into perspective, Fernando Torres took 39 matches to score four goals for the club. Let's throw another Spaniard into the mix. Fabregas has created a goal in each of his last five appearances. Also, he has now scored three and assisted three more goals in his last three EPL visits to Goodison Park. Costa and Fabregas a dudes, Torres is a dud.
- Arsenal Wenger is (still) in denial: 19 chances created, 24 shots taken, 22 crosses pinged, 28 take ons attempted and 33 blocks forced. But still just one goal scored against Leicester in a 1-1 draw. And while Arsenal were playing Leicester and reminding everyone that they needed to buy a striker but will not, Loic Remy was unveiled as a Chelsea player and Radamel Falcao was waiting on a move to either Manchester City or Real Madrid. In Arsene we trust -- NOT.
- Manchester City can lose: Similarly, Stoke can win. Saturday was the first time since February that City failed to score at the Etihad in the league. The last time they didn't score was when they lose 0-1 to Chelsea. Why is it a big deal you as? Because it's only the second time in their last 71 Premier League games at home that it happened. And it happened against Stoke. 
- Spurs had one shot on target v Liverpool: And that in itself should be enough. But in case you didn't know, Liverpool ran riot at Spurs again. Their 3-0 win means they've now scored 12 times against Spurs in three matches. Maybe this should not be considered a big match anymore.
