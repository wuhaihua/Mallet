Bryant revealed in an interview that took place in China that he gave Swaggy P some advice on how to perform better on the offensive end. From insidesocal.com:  &ldquo;To be unstoppable, you have to first be predictable,&rdquo; Bryant said, recalling his conversation with Young. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unpredictable, you don&rsquo;t know what the heck you&rsquo;re going to do. So how can you dictate to the defense what you&rsquo;re going to do? So you have to be really simple.&rdquo;  While it might seem strange to hear Bryant describe his game as simple, it actually is heavily based on the fundamentals, so it makes sense.  I do the moves over and over,&rdquo; Bryant said. &ldquo;Especially in my younger days, I didn&rsquo;t really focus on trying to get my feet faster. I focused on the moves. Whether it was a fadeaway, or whether it was a crossover, I did the move over and over and over. Then, I got faster at doing moves. My feet got faster at doing the moves. When you have repetition with what it is you&rsquo;re trying to do, you inevitably get better and faster at that. The most important thing in basketball isn&rsquo;t speed anyway. It&rsquo;s not speed. It&rsquo;s skill.&rdquo;  Although&nbsp;Young isn&rsquo;t a particularly young player at 29, he would still benefit from Bryant&rsquo;s advice. Young is a very talented offensive player, but it could be sharper and putting some extra work in on the fundamentals would help. Young averaged 17.9 points and 1.5 assists per game last season with Los Angeles.
