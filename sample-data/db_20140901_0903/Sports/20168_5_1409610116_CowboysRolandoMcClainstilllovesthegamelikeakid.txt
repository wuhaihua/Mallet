Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsNFL    It seems like Rolando McClain has come in and out of retirement more times than Brett Favre did. This time, it may be a longer stint, especially since he was named a Dallas Cowboys starting linebacker on Monday. He seems giddy and passionate about football again.  &ldquo;I still love the game like I&rsquo;m an 8-, 9-year old kid,&rdquo; McClain said, via ESPN.com. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about getting back into it, building chemistry with some of these guys, some trust, and just playing and having fun really.&rdquo; McClain took 20 months away from football. He is a former first-round selection with a great deal of talent, but&nbsp;has often lacked the effort necessary for the NFL. He&rsquo;s putting in his time &mdash; even if he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily want to. &ldquo;If I lied and said I did enjoy camp, then you shouldn&rsquo;t ask me any more questions,&rdquo; McClain said, laughing. He&rsquo;s gotten further than some might have expected, and as the regular season opener draws closer, it almost comes as a surprise that he&rsquo;s still on the roster. But the Cowboys are certainly glad to have him. Their linebacking depth is lacking, particularly following the injury to Sean Lee. He&rsquo;s trying to be a new man and help push forward the ailing Cowboys&rsquo; defenses. He&rsquo;s limiting his off the field problems by cutting out people &mdash; friends and family &mdash; who are close to him that are bad influences. Alleviating the trouble off the field makes him better on the field. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just an overall better man,&rdquo; McClain said. &ldquo;That makes me a better football player, a better boyfriend, a better father. You&rsquo;ve got to start with the base, man, get yourself right and then fill in the blanks from there. That&rsquo;s what I had to do.&rdquo;
