			Cristian Demuro will partner Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe favourite Sea The Moon for the first time when the unbeaten colt makes his final competitive appearance before next month's Longchamp showpiece in this weekend's Grosser Preis Von Baden.Andreas Helfenbein partnered the three-year-old to victory on his first two competitive appearances, but Belgian-born superstar rider Christophe Soumillon took over when Sea The Moon ran out a breathtaking winner of the German Derby.However, with Soumillon not available on Sunday due to riding commitments in France, trainer Markus Klug has had to find a replacement and Demuro has been given the call-up.Klug said: "Cristian will ride on Sunday as Christophe Soumillon is required to ride for the Aga Khan in France."While he has been forced to make alternative riding plans for this weekend, Klug has not given up hope Soumillon could get back aboard Sea The Moon in the Arc."I hope he will be available in October," said the trainer.
