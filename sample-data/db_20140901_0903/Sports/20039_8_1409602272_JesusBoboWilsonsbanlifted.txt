Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher announced Monday receiver         Jesus "Bobo" Wilson's indefinite suspension, which stemmed from a June theft of a scooter, has been lifted.

     

Wilson missed the Seminoles'         season-opening 37-31 victory over          Oklahoma State on Saturday, although he traveled with the team and dressed for the game.

The sophomore was originally charged with a third-degree grand motor theft, a felony, in connection with stealing a scooter. Wilson admitted to police he took the scooter when he saw the keys ignition and crashed it while driving.

In July, Wilson pleaded down to two misdemeanors, his attorney, Tim Jansen, told ESPN.com. Jansen said Wilson had the initial felony charge reduced to misdemeanor petty theft and misdemeanor criminal mischief. Wilson already has paid $1,074 in restitution to the scooter owner, and was sentenced to spend 30 days on a jail work camp and two years' probation. The probation can be reduced to one year if he completes the work camp.

Florida State policy states any player charged with a felony is immediately suspended from representing the school in any games, but Wilson was able to continue practicing. Throughout preseason camp, Fisher praised Wilson's maturity since the incident.

Wilson could be immediately inserted into the starting lineup for the Seminoles' next game, 7:30 p.m. Saturday against The Citadel. As a freshman, the 5-foot-9, 177-pound Miami native had three receptions for 23 yards in limited action.

Fisher had no update on defensive end/linebacker         Chris Casher, who missed the opener because of an academic issue.
