Bears Jon Bostic on 2014: We got a lot to prove Bears Jon Bostic on 2014: We got a lot to prove  It's no secret that the expectations are high in the Windy City for the Bears in 2014.
The offense returns all of its starters from last year which saw the team post huge scoring numbers. The defense, the weakest link from last year's 8-8 season, signed some big additions on the defensive line with Jared Allen and Lamarr Houston and drafted some new faces in the secondary with Kyle Fuller and Brock Vereen. With the season opener against the Buffalo Bills only days away, linebacker Jon Bostic knows it's go time for the Bears.
"It's a big year for us," Bostic said. "We got a lot to prove. We got to take it day-by-day and keep just trying to get better, just like we've been doing."Â 

Even though he's only been in the NFL for two years, Bostic is smart enough to realize that the moves the Bears made in the offseason to bolster the defense isn't going to make them an instant success. It'll take time for that unit to come together and reach its full potential.
"We got goals that we set for this defense, and we know it's not going to happen overnight," he said. "It's not going to happen by just talking about it. Putting in the work and making sure we are doing things the way we say we're going to do it is the main thing for us."
