                    Free-agent forward Earl Clark, who followed up a breakthrough year with the Lakers by bouncing between the Cavaliers and Knicks last year, will be working out this week for the defending champion Spurs, a source told Sporting News. Clark is in San Antonio today and will be there through Wednesday.

Clark averaged 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds for LA&nbsp;in 2012-13 before signing a contract with Cleveland last year. But he struggled to fit in with the Cavs and was eventually dealt to Philadelphia in the Spencer Hawes trade. The Sixers cut him and he closed out the year playing nine games with New York.&nbsp;



The Spurs potentially have open roster spots, depending on how they handle team options, and they&nbsp;are reportedly considering pursuing guard Ray Allen, who might retire.
