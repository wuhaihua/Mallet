                    Don&#39;t expect to see Miguel Cabrera in the Detroit Tigers lineup for a while. An injured ankle forced him out of a Saturday game and could keep him idle.

Not that Cabrera wants to sit. But manager Brad Ausmus said Saturday his slugging star needs four or five days off.

Cabrera was out of the lineup Sunday at the Tigers faced the Chicago White Sox. Officially, he is day to day. The Tigers entered Sunday tied with the Kansas City Royals for the AL Central lead.

Even a week&#39;s rest won&#39;t return Cabrera&#39;s ankle to full health, Ausmus told MLive.com. He said he would be shocked if it did.

Cabrera was the American League&#39;s most valuable player the past two seasons and the first Triple Crown winner in nearly 50 years.

Since he seldom speaks to media members, Cabrera&#39;s lack in response to questions on Saturday wasn&#39;t surprising.

Here&#39;s what spoke volumes: Cabrera was 0-for-15 before a single in Saturday&#39;s first game of a doubleheader, and then was 0-for-3 before being pulled in the nightcap.

Going 1-for-19 has to be worrisome for the Tigers. Also, Cabrera&#39;s batting average is now .299, the first time in years he hasn&#39;t been hitting better than .300. His power and production numbers also are off.
