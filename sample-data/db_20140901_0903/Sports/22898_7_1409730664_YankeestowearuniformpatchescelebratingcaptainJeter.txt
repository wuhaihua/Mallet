                    NEW YORK&nbsp;&mdash; The New York Yankees will celebrate Derek Jeter&#39;s career by wearing a special patch on their caps and jerseys during his final few weeks in the majors.

The team announced Tuesday that a logo depicting Jeter&#39;s last season will appear on the hats and left sleeves of players&#39; uniforms beginning Sunday, when the club hosts Derek Jeter Day at Yankee Stadium. A pregame ceremony highlighting the star shortstop&#39;s career is planned before New York faces the Kansas City Royals.

After that, the Yankees will wear the patches for the rest of the season. Jeter, the longtime Yankees captain, is retiring after this year.
