Buckley, Shaughnessy: What would you give up for Sale? Buckley, Shaughnessy: What would you give up for Sale? August 31, 2014, 9:45 pm After Jon Lester and John Lackey ere traded at the deadline, the Red Sox now have to search for their new ace before the 2015 season. 
Many have mentioned James Shields and Cole Hamels as possible targets, but what about Chicago White Sox pitcher Chris Sale? 
The Baseball Show panel discussed who they would include in a deal for the White Sox lefty.
"We're going to hear prospects, it's so hard until you find out who," said Merloni. "If you throw out six names, all of them got to go, slow down a little bit. If I'm going to give up Owens, I'm not going to give up Swihart."
Dan Shaughnessy isn't willing to deal Henry Owens unless the price is right.
"Don't you think he's as close to untouchable that they have?" asked Shaughnessy. "He only gets into conversation if it is Stanton. That's how I feel.  I haven't heard a pitcher out there that I would make Owens part of that deal."
Shaughnessy believes this talk could all be avoided if the organization signed Lester. 
"They had the guy here, Lester," he said. "It's amazing to think of all the things they have to do now, including parting with prospects, which you didn't have to do if you just gave [Lester] money that you knew could do the job."
