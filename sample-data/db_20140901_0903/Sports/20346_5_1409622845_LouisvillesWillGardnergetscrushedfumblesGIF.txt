Mandatory Credit: Howard Smith-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The Louisville Cardinals got off to a great start in their very first ACC game against the Miami Hurricanes Monday night.  After the two teams traded three-and-outs, the Cardinals, led by quarterback Will Gardner, nearly drove the length of the field, going 93 yards in 12 plays, capped by a two-yard pass from Gardner to Charles Standberry for the score. The Cardinals got the ball back again after the Hurricanes tied things at 7 but were forced to start on their own 10 because of a penalty. On the next play, Hurricanes&rsquo; defensive lineman Anthony Chickillo beat his man and drilled Gardner, forcing a fumble that the Hurricanes recovered. You can watch the play below.
