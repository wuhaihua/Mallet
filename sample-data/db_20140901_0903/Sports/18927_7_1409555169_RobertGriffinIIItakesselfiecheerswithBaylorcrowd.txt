                    Robert Griffin III is the first Heisman winner in Baylor history, and after the Bears unveiled a statue of him outside brand new McLane Stadium on Sunday, Griffin decided to hang out with the fans that gave him his start.

During halftime of the Bears&#39; home opener against SMU, Griffin stood in front of a section of yellow-clad Baylor fans and pumped them up. When the crows was all hyped up, Griffin took a selfie, posting it to his Twitter feed.


The Bears are currently ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll and had a firm handle on the Mustangs at half.
