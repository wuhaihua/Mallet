                    The Raiders, employing the good old &quot;ah heck, why not&quot; method, are going with a rookie at quarterback.

Oakland players were informed Monday that&nbsp;second-round draft pick Derek Carr will start over veteran Matt Schaub, according to Fox Sports&#39; Jay Glazer. It was not immediately clear whether Carr is considered the full-time starter or if the move is temporary.&nbsp;

A sore elbow for&nbsp;Schaub and a strong finish to the preseason by&nbsp;Carr had&nbsp;injected&nbsp;doubt into what had seemed to be a resolved issue as recently as four days ago. Coach Dennis&nbsp;Allen said unequivocally last week that Schaub would start the opener against the&nbsp;Jets on Sept. 7 even as he was sitting out the week of practice with a sore throwing elbow.

But Allen was far from definitive&nbsp;Friday, a day after Carr threw three touchdown passes and led the Raiders to the end zone on all four drives he played in the exhibition finale against Seattle.

&quot;There&#39;s a lot of things that go into a performance,&quot; Allen said at the time. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of things that factor into the decision-making process. But I will say that I was very pleased with what I saw out of Derek Carr.&quot;

The Raiders did not expect&nbsp;Carr&nbsp;to challenge for the starting spot so soon after they drafted him&nbsp;out of Fresno State. That pick came less than two weeks after they acquired Schaub in a trade from Houston and immediately anointed him the starter.
