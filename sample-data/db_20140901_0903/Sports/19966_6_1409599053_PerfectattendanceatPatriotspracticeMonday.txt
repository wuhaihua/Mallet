Perfect attendance at Patriots practice Monday Perfect attendance at Patriots practice Monday September 1, 2014, 2:00 pm FOXBORO -- The Patriots had full attendance at Monday's practice at Gillette Stadium. All 53 players on the active rosters and the 10 newly-signed practice-squad players were out on the field wearing shells and shorts while temperatures approached 90 degrees.
Defensive lineman Chris Jones, who has been dealing with an ankle injury suffered in preseason game No. 1 against the Redskins, was warming up on a lower field while the rest of his teammates stretched to open the session.
Recently re-signed long-snapper Charley Hughlett appeared more ready to get things going in his first practice with the Patriots since he was released in May after a brief stay. During a half-speed punt drill, he accidentally snapped a ball into special teams coach Scott O'Brien before O'Brien could get out of the line of fire between Hughlett and punter Ryan Allen.
Corner Brandon Browner and receiver Brian Tyms are suspended and not eligible to practice with the team until Week 5.
