			Northampton have bolstered their back-row options with the signing of former London Irish flanker Jon Fisher.Fisher missed the second half of last season with concussion troubles but has proved his fitness in a pre-season trial with the Aviva Premiership champions.The 25-year-old has trained with the Saints all summer, stepping in as cover for the injured Sam Dickinson, who is recovering from neck surgery.He is only Northampton's second signing of the off-season, following half-back Joel Hodgson's move from Newcastle."Jon is a talented player who will give us depth across the back row," said Saints rugby director Jim Mallinder, who is preparing his side for Friday's season-opener against Gloucester."He has worked hard throughout our pre-season training, putting in plenty of effort in both conditioning and rugby sessions."More importantly he has shown that he has the determination to play and succeed here at Franklin's Gardens, and we were delighted to offer him this contract."Fisher said: "I've had a great time at the Saints this summer, working with a superb group of coaches and outstanding players."I had no hesitation in accepting Jim's offer to join the squad full-time and am looking forward to helping the Saints maintain their place at the top of English rugby."
