Brady on future: 'When I suck, I'll retire' Brady on future: 'When I suck, I'll retire' On Sunday, Tom Brady will begin his 15th season under center for the New England Patriots. The 37-year-old has three Super Bowl rings, nine Pro Bowl appearances and has started more playoff games than any quarterback in history. But if you think he&#8217;s slowing down, you&#8217;re just going to have to wait until he starts &#8220;sucking.&#8221;
He spoke about his future on a weekly spot on WEEI&#8217;s Dennis and Callahan Show:
“There&#8217;s nowhere I&#8217;d rather play, I know that. I love playing for this team and I love representing this team and hopefully I can do that for as long as I can. When I suck, I’ll retire. But I don’t plan on sucking for a long time. So hopefully that leads me to being here and there’s no place I’d rather be. I love this game and I love working hard at it. I&#8217;ve had a lot of people over the years tell me the things I couldn&#8217;t do and I think that’s always been great motivation for me to try to go out there an accomplish things that I think I can do so hopefully I can continue to play at a really high level for a long period of time.&#8221;

If you asked most top-tier athletes when they&#8217;ll retire, most would say the same sort of thing, albeit with less colloquial flair. Everyone likes to think they&#8217;ll have the foresight and self-awareness to retire when they&#8217;ve lost their abilities. Yet most are too blind to their own declines, as they should be &#8212; athletes don&#8217;t make it to the top of their sports without a plethora of self belief.
When the era of the hundred-million dollar contracts began, there was some speculation that athletes wouldn&#8217;t play as long as they used to, the idea being that with their money made, players could retire earlier. That was always bunk. Tom Brady isn&#8217;t playing for money at this point in his career. He&#8217;s playing for rings and his legacy. As long as his performance can help him build those things, Brady is going to keep it going.
