Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Talent has never been a question for Andrew Wiggins. The No. 1 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, Wiggins has shown a unique skill set that could easily make him a fixture at All-Star Weekend though his mental game has routinely been questioned.  Even those close to him like his former Kansas head coach, Bill Self, have questioned if Andrew Wiggins wants to be the star that his ability would allow him to become. But Wiggins is seemingly tired of the talk, recently telling the Star Tribune that he&rsquo;s ready to become a special player for the Minnesota Timberwolves. &ldquo;I wanted to go to a place where I&rsquo;m pushed to do a lot and become a special piece for the team,&rdquo; Wiggins said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help me reach my potential. &hellip; I said I wanted to play for a team that wanted me, and now I&rsquo;m here and I feel nothing but love.&rdquo; To be fair, Andrew Wiggins is still just 19-years-old. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of players who&rsquo;ve come into any professional league with a take-over mentality, though his desire to play the background role at Kansas to Joel Embiid understandably did worry some in the NBA. Given that, Wiggins likely needed to go to a destination where he would essentially be forced into becoming a star and there&rsquo;s no better place than the Minnesota Timberwolves who are now void of franchise building block. The former Kansas product would have continually played second fiddle (at best) to LeBron James with the Cleveland Cavaliers, so there&rsquo;s no doubt the T&rsquo;Wolves are a far better situation for Wiggins in the long-run.
