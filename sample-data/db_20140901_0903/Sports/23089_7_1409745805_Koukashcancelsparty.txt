			Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash has cancelled the club's end-of-year party after they failed to reach the Super League playoffsKoukash had set a target of a top-four finish for last year's wooden spoonists in 2015 after a major overhaul of the team, claiming he would be disappointed if they failed to make the top six.Last Sunday's 42-6 defeat at Wakefield ended their hopes of finishing in the top eight with two games left of the regular season.The angry chairman has responded by cancelling the players' annual end-of-season celebration, which was due to be held this weekend."We have nothing to celebrate," Koukash told the Manchester Evening News. "We have not won anything and we are not in the playoffs."We focus our energy instead on winning our last two games - not handing out awards when we have not won anything of significance."To me, winning is everything and I have always made this very clear."I guess some fans can understand where I am coming from and they will be disappointed but the presentation will not happen."
