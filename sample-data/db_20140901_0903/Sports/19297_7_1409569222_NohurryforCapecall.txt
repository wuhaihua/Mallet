			Rae Guest will give Cape Factor time to get over her trip to Germany before making plans for the filly after she made a pleasing return to action following a three-and-a-half month lay-off.Guest was delighted with the performance of Cape Factor, who was only beaten a neck by Sir Mark Prescott's Athenian as the two British raiders dominated the finish of the Listed Coolmore Stud Baden-Baden Cup.That was her first run since she was well-beaten in the French 1000 Guineas at Longchamp back in May."We were very pleased with Cape Factor as that was her first run since May," said the Newmarket trainer."She wasn't right after she ran in the French Guineas, so we gave her a break, turned her out, brought her back, so that was a great run."Her and Sir Mark Prescott's horse (Athenian) pulled well clear of the rest and the fourth was the German Guineas winner (Ajaxana) so it was a bit of a hot Listed race and we were very pleased with her."She is dependent on soft ground. That was a long trip for her after having had such a long time off, so we will see how she is for a week or so and then try to find another race for her."She was staying on so well over seven furlongs yesterday that we might go back to a mile."
