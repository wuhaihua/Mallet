                        The         Oakland Raiders have named rookie         Derek Carr their starting quarterback, according to a Fox Sports report.

     

Carr will get the nod over veteran         Matt Schaub, who is playing his first season in Oakland after spending the past seven seasons starting for the         Houston Texans.





Carr, a second-round pick from Fresno State, completed of 11 of 13 passes for 143 yards and three touchdowns, including two one-play touchdown passes in a 41-31 win over the         Seattle Seahawks in the preseason finale for both.

Both quarterbacks have been banged up this preseason, with Carr suffering a concussion and a rib injury in one game and Schaub dealing with what the team has called a minor elbow issue.

Coach Dennis Allen has said he wanted to wait to see how Schaub felt Monday before naming a starting a quarterback.

Schaub last played in the team's third preseason game where he went 13-for-27 and threw for 110 yards in a 31-21 loss to the         Green Bay Packers.

The Raiders open the season Sunday at the         New York Jets.
