"Who the hell knows?" said Gary Tanguay. "Seven games he played in last year. He played 11 games in the year prior. So, I don't think you can expect him to play all 16 [games]." 
Although Gronk has taken some criticism over his durability, Bob Ryan doesn't blame last season's injury on the tight end.
"Last year, it could've happened to anybody," explained Ryan. " It could happen to any 6'6" tight end when some gnat of a defensive back decided, 'I can't tackle him legally, I'll go for the knee.'"
