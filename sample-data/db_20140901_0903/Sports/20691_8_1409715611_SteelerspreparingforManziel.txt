Steelers preparing for Manziel Steelers preparing for Manziel Cleveland Browns coach Mike Pettine has dropped hints he might have a package of plays that feature rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel's dual-threat ability to give opposing defenses more to plan for than pocket-bound Browns starter Brian Hoyer.Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is certain that his defense will see both passers "in some capacity" when the Steelers host the AFC North division rival Browns in Sunday's season opener."We have a great deal of respect for Johnny Manziel and his talents and what he did to get to this point in his career," Tomlin said during Tuesday's news conference. "We fully expect them to utilize him in some capacity in this football game. "They didn't draft him in the first round to watch. ... We understand that."So we're going through the process of preparing ourselves for both guys."Tomlin doesn't anticipate the Cleveland offense would be drastically different with Manziel."Obviously, Manziel has some unique run skills and capabilities I think they're capable of highlighting," Tomlin said while dismissing the notion that the Browns have already scored a small victory by forcing the Steelers defense to broaden its focus."I don't believe that because I believe all the things they're going to potentially ask (Manziel) to do Brian Hoyer is fully capable of doing it as well. ... I just think when you have a talent like Johnny Manziel, you're going to get him on the field and help him grow and develop."Tomlin served on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers staff with current Browns offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan during the 2004 and 2005 seasons.Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau said earlier in the preseason that he was preparing for Manziel before Hoyer edged the rookie out for the starting job.Manziel had an up-and-down August with his accuracy and progressions from the pocket. But there is no denying the spark he supplies with what Pettine called "Johnny being Johnny" moments whenever he replaced Hoyer and was able to turn a broken play into a positive one.Also Tuesday, Tomlin announced that Steelers Pro Bowl receiver Antonio Brown will return punts this season.***Follow Jim Corbett on Twitter @ByJimCorbettPHOTOS: Johnny Football comes to Cleveland
