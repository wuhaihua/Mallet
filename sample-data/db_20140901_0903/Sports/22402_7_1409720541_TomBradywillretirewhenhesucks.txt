                    Tom Brady doesn&#39;t show many (if any) signs of slowing down at age 37, and the Patriots quarterback&#39;s Hall of Fame career won&#39;t end until that happens.&nbsp;

Brady, speaking Tuesday&nbsp;on&nbsp;WEEI&#39;s Dennis &amp; Callahan Morning Show, claimed it won&#39;t be anytime soon.



&quot;When I suck, I&rsquo;ll retire,&quot; Brady said.&nbsp;&quot;I don&rsquo;t plan on sucking for a long time. Hopefully, that leads me to be in here, and there&rsquo;s no place I&rsquo;d rather be. I love this game, and I love working hard at it.&quot;

The topic of career moves came up after Brady was asked about last week&#39;s Logan Mankins trade &mdash; the latest teammate and friend Brady&#39;s seen take off a Patriots uniform for good.

&quot;I haven&rsquo;t really spoken to anybody about it,&quot;&nbsp;Brady said of the guard&#39;s trade. &quot;I have my own personal feelings that obviously are very personal to me. Whatever those are, I just want our team to be the best it can be for this year. I love Logan. Logan was a great friend of mine. Nobody stood for Patriot football more than him. But he&rsquo;s moved on. I hope he&rsquo;s happy. We&rsquo;ll keep in touch.&quot;

Brady begins his 15th NFL season Sunday when New England travels to Miami for a Week 1 divisional matchup.&nbsp;&nbsp;
