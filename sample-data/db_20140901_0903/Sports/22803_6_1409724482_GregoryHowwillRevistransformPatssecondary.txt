Gregory: How will Revis transform Pats secondary? Gregory: How will Revis transform Pats secondary? September 3, 2014, 1:00 am The Patriots defense is expected to be one of the best in the league after bringing in Darrelle Revis among others in the offseason.
Former Patriot Steve Gregory joined Arbella Early Edition to discuss the impact Revis will make for the team's defense.
"Just knowing you can put [Revis] on the opposing team's number one receiver and not even worry about him," said Gregory. "You can shift defensive coverages to the other side of the field, you can draw blitzes. Matt Patricia is going to have a lot of fun being able to lock that guy on a number one receiver week in and week out."
When he was with the Jets, Revis said that he didn't like Bill Belichick. Gregory explained how that has changed.
"As soon as you become teammates you respect the guy for what he's done," explained Gregory. "Revis respects Bill [Belichick] for the professional that he is, how he can coach a team, get teams to playoffs, always have a shot competing for a championship. That's what Revis is about, he's going to come to work every day. Bill's going to respect that about him, he's going to respect that about Bill. They're going to have a good relationship."
