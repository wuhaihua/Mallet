But he struggled in four seasons with the White Sox, batting just .201, though with decent power. This season, he's batting .220 with 20 homers in 363 at-bats.The A's, however, are just 12-16 since trading Cespedes, and many of their first-half stars have struggled. Brandon Moss, a left-handed batter who may lose at-bats to Dunn, is hitting just .189 with two home runs since earning an All-Star nod. He hit 21 home runs before the All-Star break.
