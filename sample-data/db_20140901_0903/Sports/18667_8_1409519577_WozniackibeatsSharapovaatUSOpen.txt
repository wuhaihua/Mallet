Wozniacki beats Sharapova at U.S. Open Wozniacki beats Sharapova at U.S. Open NEW YORK – Caroline Wozniacki survived a second-set barrage from Maria Sharapova to advance to the U.S. Open quarterfinals on Sunday for the first time since 2011.In a battle of former No. 1s, No. 10 seed Wozniacki of Denmark beat the fifth-seeded Russian 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in just over two-and-a-half hours."It means so much for me," said Wozniacki in an on-court interview, whose wedding to No. 1 golfer Rory McIlroy was abruptly called off in May. "It's been a bit up and down for me this year."Sharapova, the reigning French Open champion and 2006 U.S. Open winner, came into the match with a WTA-tour best 17-6 record in three-set matches.But on a hot and windy day on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Wozniacki, a 2009 U.S. Open runner-up, held her ground and was steadier down the stretch.She coaxed Sharapova into long rallies, including a spectacular, scrambling defensive effort to break Sharapova in the fourth game before winning five of the last six games to close out the match.Sharapova's loss leaves only two of the top eight seeds alive – No. 1 Serena Williams of the USA and No. 7 Eugenie Bouchard of Canada.In the quarterfinals, Wozniacki will play No. 13 seed Sara Errani of Italy, who defeated qualifier Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Crotia 6-3, 2-6, 6-0.PHOTOS: Day 7 at the U.S. Open
