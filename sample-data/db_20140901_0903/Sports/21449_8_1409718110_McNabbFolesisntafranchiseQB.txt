McNabb: Foles isn't a franchise QB McNabb: Foles isn't a franchise QB Former Eagles QB and Fox analyst Donovan McNabb is not one to shy away from hot takes, and his latest one is aimed squarely at current Eagles started Nick Foles.
This is how he responded when asked on 97.5 The Fanatic if he thought Foles was a franchise quarterback:
&#8220;I really can&#8217;t answer that at this particular point, but if I had to give a take, I would say no. I think what he will do, he won&#8217;t do what he did last year, that just won&#8217;t happen. I see him more being a 25 touchdown, maybe 8, maybe 10 interception guy.&#8221;
That&#8217;s a great rhetorical move, by the way. I can&#8217;t answer that question, but here I am going to answer that question.
Someone then asked Foles about McNabb&#8217;s comment, and the young quarterback stayed on script with his response. 
&#8220;Everybody is entitled to their opinion. I haven&#8217;t earned anything yet,&#8221; Foles said after practice. &#8220;It&#8217;s a week-to-week thing. My job is to go out there and play to the best of my ability.&#8221;
