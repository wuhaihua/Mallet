Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNHL   Bobby Ryan spent the offseason in Idaho, which is probably a relaxing preamble to the circus he&rsquo;s facing this season. With center Jason Spezza gone to Dallas, Ryan remains as arguably the team&rsquo;s best offensive player save for perhaps defenseman Erik Karlsson. Not only does Ryan expect more of a leadership role, but he expects to deal with questions all season in relation to his contract, which expires after the upcoming season.  &ldquo;In my conversations with (Senators coach Paul MacLean) this summer, I know there will be a little more of a role for me to take on as a leader,&rdquo; Ryan told the Ottawa Citizen. &ldquo;I think his expectations have shifted for me to be more of a vocal leader in the room. And that&rsquo;s fine. I can do that.&rdquo; Ryan tallied 48 points in 70 games with the Senators last season en route to the fifth 20+ goal season of his career. The Senators lost the two cornerstone forwards of their team, Spezza and Daniel Alfredsson, in the last two summers and if they lose Ryan as well, it will be hard to take the team seriously as anything but cannon fodder for the top teams in the NHL. Ryan acknowledged the distraction of his contract talks, while accepting their nature. &ldquo;Everybody is going to read so far into it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural. And I understand that. (The media) has a job to do to ask questions and that&rsquo;s all going to come with it, but from everyone I talk to, it&rsquo;s a long process.&rdquo;
