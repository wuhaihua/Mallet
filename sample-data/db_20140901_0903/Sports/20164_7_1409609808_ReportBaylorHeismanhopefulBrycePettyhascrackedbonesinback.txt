                    The excitement surrounding&nbsp;Baylor&#39;s debut of brand new McLane Stadium and the dedication of Robert Griffin III&#39;s statue took a humbling hit during the actual game when Heisman hopeful quarterback Bryce Petty got hurt. It&#39;s a little worse than expected but not yet&nbsp;reason for concern.&nbsp;

An MRI Monday revealed Petty has two cracks in his back, according to a CBSSports.com report, but he&#39;s day-to-day and&nbsp;expects to play this week against Northwestern State.&nbsp;

&quot;Right now, (I)&nbsp;can&#39;t sit down right, can&#39;t walk right,&quot;&nbsp;Petty said, according to the report. &quot;I&#39;m bummed out because I just watched tape and everything is off. You never want to make any excuses. When you&#39;re throwing and I can&#39;t torque (it&#39;s frustrating). Every time I went to throw it would jolt. It felt like somebody was punching me in my side.&quot;

Petty, the reigning Big 12 offensive player of the year,&nbsp;accounted for three touchdowns in the first half of&nbsp;a 45-0 victory over SMU. He&nbsp;took a bruising shot to his lower back on Baylor&#39;s first offensive drive. Petty&nbsp;then moved gingerly at times, often grabbing at his back and side between plays. He did not play in the second half.
