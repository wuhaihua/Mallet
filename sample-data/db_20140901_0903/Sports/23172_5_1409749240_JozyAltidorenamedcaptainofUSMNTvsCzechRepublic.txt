Whomever shall the U.S. national team turn to as captain for its Wednesday friendly against the Czech Republic?  With those players out of action, manager Jurgen Klinsmann has turned to a 24-year-old Jozy Altidore to lead the USMNT against the Czech&rsquo;s. At first glance it seems an odd move to turn to such a young player, especially with veterans like Brad Guzan and Nick Rimando on the roster for this mostly European based team. However, Altidore is one of the most veteran field players in the USMNT set up, having made 71 appearances since debuting at the age of 17 in 2007. It&rsquo;s easy to see why this move was made when you also realize that Klinsmann also plans to use both Guzan and Rimando in net during this contest. Having one captain throughout the game is a smart move and something that could be a harbinger of things to come for the future. That&rsquo;s what this, and other friendlies to end 2014, will be all about anyway. Let&rsquo;s not forget that Clint Dempsey, the captain during this past World Cup, isn&rsquo;t a spring chicken anymore (32 years old) and grooming someone to replace him in the role of captain for the future isn&rsquo;t the worst idea in the world. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out with a largely experimental roster when the USMNT takes on the Czech Republic at 2:15pm ET on NBC Sports Network.
