Cubs: Starlin Castro leaves game with ankle sprain Cubs: Starlin Castro leaves game with ankle sprain  Starlin Castro will get an MRI after leaving Tuesday night’s game with a sprained left ankle. The All-Star shortstop will continue to be evaluated, but the Cubs said they’ve already ruled out a fracture.It was a scary image at Wrigley Field, Castro sliding awkwardly and getting his left leg tangled up before reaching home plate in the first inning. Castro had hit a line-drive single into left field off Milwaukee Brewers starter Yovani Gallardo and scored from second base on Jorge Soler’s RBI single to left.   
Clearly in pain, Castro rolled around in the dirt as the team’s athletic trainers rushed out to home plate. With their help, he limped off the field.  Javier Baez shifted over to shortstop while Logan Watkins replaced Castro and moved to second base.
