His father coached the Hoyas from 1973-99, leading the team to an NCAA championship in 1984 and to three Final Four berths during the career of Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing. The elder Thompson had a record of 596-239 in parts of 27 seasons at Georgetown. Thompson III is 227-104 in 10 seasons and led the Hoyas to a Final Four berth&mdash;with Hibbert as his center&mdash;in 2007. Hibbert is the third former Hoya to make a donation to the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center in the last two weeks. Ewing and his agent, David Falk, donated $3.3 million to the facility in late August and Boston Celtics forward Jeff Green gave $1 million late last week. A groundbreaking ceremony for the$62 million project is set for Sept. 12. All of the money for the project is being donated.      Next postPrev postUse your ← → (arrows) to browse
