Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsNBA    It is no secret restricted free agent Greg Monroe wants out of Detroit. That&rsquo;s why he may sign his qualifying offer and play one more year with the Pistons before becoming an unrestricted free agent next year. However, the Pistons still could pursue a sign-and-trade with Monroe.  Chuck Myron of Hoops Rumors believes the Atlanta Hawks could be a good fit for Monroe but they&rsquo;d likely have to give up Paul Millsap. The idea that he&rsquo;d sign the QO isn&rsquo;t quite as far-fetched as the notion that Bledsoe would take it, since Monroe&rsquo;s QO is worth about $1.7MM more, I still think he&rsquo;ll sign a long-term deal, either with the Pistons or as part of a sign-and-trade. And if he does so with the Pistons, I suspect they&rsquo;ll try to move him at the deadline. And for teams that could take him, I&rsquo;ll continue to trot out the Hawks, who make sense in a sign-and-trade scenario if they&rsquo;ll give up Paul Millsap. Monroe put up 15.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game while shooting 49.7% from the field and 65.7% from the free throw line last season. Monroe, who was the seventh-overall pick in the first round of the 2010 draft, has averaged 14.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 50.8% from the floor and 67.8% from the foul line. &nbsp;Millsap was fantastic for the Hawks last season, going for 17.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.1 blocks per game while shooting 46.1% from the field, 35.8% from three and 73.1% from the foul line. In his eight-year career, he&rsquo;s averaged 13.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.0 blocks per game while shooting 50.7% from the field, 32.9% from downtown and 72.4% from the foul line.
