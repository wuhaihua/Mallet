I would seem as if Detective Gordon, his partner Harvey Bullock, and the villains of Gotham City have already found their home once their season has come to an end. According to Deadline,&nbsp;Gotham will be headed to Netflix following the conclusion of the season on broadcast television. This means that we may potentially be looking at somewhere around September of 2015. Providing the series is picked up for a second season, which after the good responses the screenings of the pilot has received we don&rsquo;t see how it couldn&rsquo;t, September 2015 would be around the time of that premiere. This is actually a rather unprecedented deal between the two sides. Under the new deal, Netflix is now the exclusive video on demand subscription service for Gotham, and will remain so in all U.S. Markets. Netflix has been on a roll lately when it comes to nabbing the rights to high quality television series. Some of you may already know that Netflix has acquired the rights to air the NBC Series The Blacklist, having shelled out nearly $2 million per episode for that right. We think it is safe to say that Netflix has your back. As most of you know, this series has a very interesting dynamic to it. It takes you deep inside the world of the Caped Crusader; the only thing is&hellip;this is long before the Caped Crusader ever existed. In Gotham, Bruce Wayne is a ten year old boy who just witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. At the scene of the crime, he meets a young detective by the name of Jim Gordon. Yes, the same Gordon that will one day be known as Commissioner Gordon. Gordon has a certain love for this city and wants to see Gotham become a thriving city once again. Unfortunately, that is going to take a lot of work and many a year before we are anywhere near that general vicinity considering all the crime and corruption Gordon has to clear out. The Batman-inspired origin story is being directed by&nbsp;Danny Cannon. Cannon is no stranger to television as he has directed shows like&nbsp;The Tomorrow People,&nbsp;Nikita, and&nbsp;CSI.&nbsp;Gotham&nbsp;is being penned by&nbsp;Bruno Heller. Heller has penned shows like&nbsp;The Mentalist&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rome. Of course, this is all based off of characters originally created by&nbsp;Bob Kane. The series stars&nbsp;Ben McKenzie&nbsp;as the young Detective Gordon.&nbsp;Gotham&nbsp;also stars&nbsp;Sons of Anarchy&nbsp;star&nbsp;Donal Logue,&nbsp;Sara Paxton,&nbsp;Jada Pinkett Smith,&nbsp;Erin Richards,&nbsp;Sean Pertwee,&nbsp;David Mazouz,&nbsp;Camren Bicondova,&nbsp;Robin Taylor, and many more. The series premiere of&nbsp;Gotham&nbsp;will debut on Monday, September 22nd&nbsp;at 8:00 p.m. on Fox. &nbsp;
