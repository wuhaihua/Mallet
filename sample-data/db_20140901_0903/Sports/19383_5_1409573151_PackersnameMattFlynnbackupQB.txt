Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Green Bay Packers may not have had much drama at their QB1 slot on the depth chart, but the competition for the second quarterback spot was in the air and up for debate for much of the preseason. Now it appears the debate has been put to rest as the team finalizes its 53-man roster. Matt Flynn will once again serve as the team&rsquo;s primary backup to Aaron Rodgers.  &ldquo;Obviously at this level you have to be physically skilled; everybody in the league is,&rdquo; Flynn said per ESPN.com. &ldquo;But not everybody that&rsquo;s physically skilled can be a successful backup quarterback or be ready to go. To me, when I look at it &hellip; you have to have the right mental makeup.&rdquo; Flynn beat out Scott Tolzien for the QB2 spot. Tolzien only had 3 NFL appearances to his credit before this offseason, all of which came in Green Bay last season. The 4th year quarterback out of Wisconsin threw 1 touchdown to 5 interceptions in his time spent in relief of Aaron Rodgers. Flynn played in place of Tolzien in the middle of Tolzien&rsquo;s third game and the former starter-candidate from Seattle then Oakland hasn&rsquo;t looked back since his return to the Packers. Flynn further credited his own mental approach for the reason he won the QB2 job. &ldquo;Any studying that I&rsquo;m doing to help [Rodgers] is helping me, too. If you know it good enough to teach it, then you know it well enough. If I&rsquo;m studying their defense enough to go and relay to him anything I see, then it&rsquo;s making my knowledge better.&rdquo;      &nbsp;
