SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — A Sioux Falls sports journalist has authored a book on the first Minnesota Vikings team to go to the Super Bowl, which happened in the last year of the old National Football League before pro football&#8217;s biggest merger.
&#8220;Last Kings of the Old NFL: The 1969 Minnesota Vikings&#8221; is Pat Duncan&#8217;s first book.
It chronicles the team&#8217;s journey in less than three years from being without a coach, quarterback or direction to becoming the last champions of a golden era in pro football.
&#8220;Last Kings&#8221; is told through narrative and interviews with more than 30 players, coaches and others.
Duncan grew up in Sioux Falls and has been a sportswriter, columnist and copy desk editor at the Argus Leader for nearly 30 years.
