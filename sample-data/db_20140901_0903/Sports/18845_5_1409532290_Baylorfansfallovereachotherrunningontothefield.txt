It sits on a river with incredible views. Welcome to McLane Stadium. Incredibly beautiful, unique setting, splendid. pic.twitter.com/bqqRZsMve0 &mdash; Richard Justice (@richardjustice) August 31, 2014  They have a pretty unique tradition as well called the Baylor Line, and they rush the field before games. From Baylor&rsquo;s website: Prior to each home football game, the Line gathers at one end of Floyd Casey Stadium and, led by the cheers of alumni and fans, runs onto the field and creates an enormous human tunnel to welcome the football team to Floyd Casey Stadium. After each player and coach has entered the stadium, The Line takes their seats in an exclusive Baylor Line section behind the opponent&rsquo;s bench to cheer on the Bears to victory. But at the unveiling of their new stadium, said tradition went tragically wrong.
