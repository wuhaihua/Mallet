Mandatory Credit: Susan Ragan-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    We&rsquo;re just about finished with the opening weekend of the 2014 college football season, which means we can look forward to what&rsquo;s in store for Week 2. Among that match ups that we will see will be a huge showdown between east and west, as the Michigan State Spartans travel out to Eugene to take on the Oregon Ducks, in what should be a tightly contested match up between two of the best teams in the country.  Well, most think that it will be tightly contested, except for the folks in Las Vegas, of course. On Sunday, the opening line for the game was set heavily in favor of the Ducks, as they sit as an 11-point favorite at the moment on the boards. While we saw on Saturday that the Oregon offense with Marcus Mariota and company is just as good as ever as they routed South Dakota 62-13, this isn&rsquo;t a slouch that they&rsquo;ll be facing in the reigning Big Ten Champions. Plus, if history has taught us anything, it&rsquo;s that when the Ducks are matched up against a physical defense, they don&rsquo;t look like their normal selves. Michigan State opened up their season on Friday night with a convincing 45-7 win over Jacksonville State, showing that they&rsquo;re ready for the challenge. What do you think? Should the line be set this high? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.   Oregon opens -11 against Sparty. WOW &mdash; Dan Wolken (@DanWolken) August 31, 2014
