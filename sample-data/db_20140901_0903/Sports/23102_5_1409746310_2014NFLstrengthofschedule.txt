Along the way, each team will have to overcome their fair share of obstacles, but the path can come easier if you benefit from one of the weaker strengths of schedule.  Unfortunately for the Oakland Raiders, they face the toughest path with an opponent win percentage of .578. Of course, strength of schedule is&nbsp;based on opponents&rsquo; winning percentage in 2013, so it is not always an accurate reflection of what you can expect from opponents in 2014. However, along with the Raiders, the Denver Broncos and St. Louis Rams top the list with the toughest schedules. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the four teams in the AFC South face the easiest roads. They will just need to battle it out in the division to see who comes out on top. How difficult is the schedule ahead for your favorite team?
