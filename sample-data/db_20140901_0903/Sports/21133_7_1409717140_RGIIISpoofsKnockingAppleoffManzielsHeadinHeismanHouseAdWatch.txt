WASHINGTON (CBSDC) &#8211; Remember in late July, when Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw attempted to knock an apple off Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s head with a &#8216;baseball&#8217;?
Well, in the &#8216;what you may have missed over the Labor Day weekend&#8217; file, Robert Griffin III attempted a similar apple trick off the head of Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, for Nissan&#8217;s &#8216;Heisman House&#8217; commercial series.
Kinda.
Filmed in a parking lot as a look behind-the-scenes, RGIII, football in-hand and sporting a Baylor Bears jersey, points to a Texas A&amp;M jersey-wearing Manziel standing some four cars away, and says, &#8220;Johnny Manziel over there, he&#8217;s questioning my accuracy. We&#8217;re gonna end that today.&#8221;
&#8220;You ready big boy?&#8221; Griffin asks Manziel, who&#8217;s placing an apple atop his head.
Griffin proceeds to rocket a football at Johnny Football, who&#8217;s quickly replaced by a tackling dummy wearing the same A&amp;M jersey in an intentionally forced sleight of hand, with the RGIII-thrown ball knocking an apple to the ground, and the camera cutting back to Griffin declaring, &#8220;That&#8217;s real!&#8221;
For his efforts, Manziel elected to reward Griffin with a congratulatory low-five, in lieu of his middle finger.
Watch the video above.
