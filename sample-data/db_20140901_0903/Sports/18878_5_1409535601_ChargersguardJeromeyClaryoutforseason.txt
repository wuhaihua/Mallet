According to the Union-Tribune San Diego:  The Chargers guard underwent hip surgery about a week ago, sources said. It&rsquo;s his second such operation in three months and third overall in the past six. Although the Physically Unable to Perform list contains a wide window in which a player can be activated and return to the field, it is not considered a lock he will play this year.  He will&nbsp;open the season on the injury reserve/PUP list. With three hip surgeries in six months, he figures to stay there for the rest of the season. It will be important for Clary to focus on his recovery to prolong his career. The Union-Tribune hints that this could be the last season for Clary in San Diego, since this is the final&nbsp;year of his contract. Johnnie Troutman, who worked at right guard for much of the preseason and should start in Clary&rsquo;s place. Players on the physically unable to perform list are required to miss six weeks in the regular season, then the player has five weeks to return to practice. The player then has 21 days from the day he begins practicing to be activated to the 53-man roster. If the deadline passes without being activated, the player is moved to the injury reserve list for the rest of the season.
