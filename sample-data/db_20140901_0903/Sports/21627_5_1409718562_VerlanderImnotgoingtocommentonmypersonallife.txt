Verlander: 'I'm not going to comment on my personal life' Verlander: 'I'm not going to comment on my personal life' Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsMLB    Detroit Tigers&rsquo; starting pitcher Justin Verlander is the object of&nbsp;jealousy&nbsp;for a number of young men in the United States of America.  As if pitching for the Detroit Tigers, making $219 million over the course of a 10-year contract, and winning Cy Young and MVP awards weren&rsquo;t all enough, Verlander is also dating super model Kate Upton. It is thanks to his relationship with Upton that Verlander found himself in the news this week as the unlikely celebrity affected by the massive online link of nude photographs. Some of the leaked photos included a nude Verlander posing with&nbsp;Upton. That topic presumably prompted the following comments from Verlander, though he did not address the leaked photos specifically (from ESPN.com): &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to comment on my personal life,&rdquo; the 31-year-old said. &ldquo;I never have and I never plan on it. I keep my personal life personal. The focus for me is on the Detroit Tigers. I don&rsquo;t want to take any focus away from this team and what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish. We&rsquo;re in the middle of a pennant race. We&rsquo;re trying to win a pennant and all of my focus currently is on doing whatever I can to help our team win our division.&rdquo; As for his ability to block out distractions in the midst of a tight playoff race, Verlander said that will be no problem for him: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been good at that,&rdquo; Verlander said of ignoring outside influences. &ldquo;This is my life. Baseball&rsquo;s my life. You&rsquo;re able to focus on that especially when you&rsquo;re on the mound doing what I&rsquo;ve done my whole life.&rdquo; This is certainly not the end of this leaked photos story, but for Verlander the focus will be on the playoff race and catching the Kansas City Royals in the American League Central.
