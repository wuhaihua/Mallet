                    Fireworks. Smoke. Motorcycles. None of these things were good enough for the Eastern Michigan football team on Saturday, so they decided to setup a cinder block wall instead. It went about how you would expect.


Armed with sledgehammers and the fervent madness brought on by a rush of adrenaline, the EMU football team tried helplessly to break through a wall of the bricks setup in front of their tunnel as they made their way to the field for their game against the Morgan State Bears.

It took the group of three large men an extended amount of time to smash through the blocks even with the heavy tools at their disposal. Maybe they should have just tipped it over and called it good.

Go Eagles! Eventually.
