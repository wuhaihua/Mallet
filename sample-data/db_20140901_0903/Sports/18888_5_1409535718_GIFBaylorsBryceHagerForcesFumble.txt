Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    Down 3-0 to Baylor, SMU quarterback Matt Davis completed a pass to Stephen Nelson to continue a potential scoring drive when Baylor&rsquo;s senior linebacker Bryce Hager stripped the ball and forced a fumble the Bears would recover. Baylor took over possession on SMU&rsquo;s 6 yard line. Running back Shock Linwood took the first-down handoff for two yards and then took the ball on the next down, running it in the rest of the way to give Baylor a 10-0 lead. Now Baylor is up 24-0. They started the game with a 10 play, 52 yard drive that took all of 1:45 and ended in a Chris Callahan filed goal. Baylor has scored a touchdown on each drive following the turnover, while each of the Mustangs&rsquo; drives have either ended in punts or turnovers. The Bears were favored from the get go, but it is those early turnovers that derail upset chances. The Bears are in control of the Mustangs. &nbsp;
