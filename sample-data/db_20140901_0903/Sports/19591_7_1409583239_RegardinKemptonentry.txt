			Betfred Ebor winner Mutual Regard figures in the 18 entries for the totescoop6 September Stakes at Kempton on Saturday.Trainer Johnny Murtagh will weigh up all the factors and chat with owner Andrew Tinkler before deciding whether to send his York scorer back across the Irish Sea."We've put him in and we're going to have a look at it," said Murtagh."I'll speak to Andrew in a couple of days and we'll probably make a decision then. He came out of the race at York very well."The QIPCO British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot and the Melbourne Cup are among big possible targets for Mutual Regard later in the year.Melbourne Cup regular Red Cadeaux is a September entry for Ed Dunlop, with Marco Botti double-handed with 2012 winner Dandino and Energia Fribby.Saeed bin Suroor has three entries - last year's winner Prince Bishop, Secret Number and Sky Hunter - while his Godolphin colleague Charlie Appleby has Cat O'Mountain.The William Haggas-trained Battalion and Ed Vaughan's Robin Hoods Bay are others in the mix.
