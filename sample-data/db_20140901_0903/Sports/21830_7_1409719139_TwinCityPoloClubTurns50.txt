MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) &#8212; The Twin City Polo Club in Maple Plain is celebrating its 50th year of existence this summer.
Yes, that sport with the horses and mallets.
If you&#8217;re like most people around the Twin Cities, it isn&#8217;t the 50 years that catches your attention. It&#8217;s the existing part.
But not only is polo played here in Minnesota, you can too.
It&#8217;s believed to be the oldest team sport on Earth, with origins possibly as far back as the 6th century – B.C.
Enjoyed by English princes, Ralph Lauren models, and, apparently, a bunch of Minnesotans just a half hour west of Minneapolis.
&#8220;Yes, I get that all the time,&#8221; says club president Austin Figge. &#8220;&#8216;Oh my god, I can&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s polo.'&#8221;
But there&#8217;s been polo for 50 years at the club, which has 15 &#8211; 20 members who play several times a week.
&#8220;That camaraderie with your horse is amazing,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;To have an animal like that – a huge, powerful, fast animal – basically be in sync with you and will do what you ask and trust you implicitly.&#8221;
They&#8217;d compare it most to Minnesota&#8217;s other marquee sport.
&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like hockey on horseback,&#8221; Figge said.
With skates that know how to play.
&#8220;The longer they play, the more they kind of know,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll know where the ball is, they&#8217;ll know kind of where you&#8217;re going to go.&#8221;
And they say the horses enjoy it as much as the humans.
&#8220;Some totally get into it,&#8221; he said.
The first time Figge heard about the polo club, his reaction probably wasn&#8217;t much different than most.
&#8220;I was like, &#8216;Come on, they don&#8217;t play polo around here,'&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;&#8216;This isn&#8217;t England, you know? I&#8217;m not a prince.'&#8221;
But as Figge found out, you don&#8217;t have to be royal to ride. Turns out, the sport of princes is a lot more accessible than you might think.
&#8220;Hey, I was there nine years ago,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;I come from a horse background, I came from the Arabian show horse world. And I was frustrated with judging &#8230; I was frustrated that it was difficult to compete when someone else was judging you. And so I was like, &#8216;Man, I really would like something with a time or a score.'&#8221;
So he came to the club, took like three lessons.
&#8220;And I was just totally hooked,&#8221; he said.
Stories like Figge&#8217;s are the reason the club has made it 50 years. Introducing new people to the sport is their lifeblood.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why we try to recruit,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;We try to get new people to come out and try it.&#8221;
They&#8217;ll teach you to play if you&#8217;re interested. You don&#8217;t have to be in line to inherit the throne of a kingdom or anything.
&#8220;My wife comes from a polo family,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;They&#8217;re definitely not princes or anything, but they work hard at it. If you can own and take care of a horse, you can play polo.&#8221;
Turns out, all you need to play polo is to want to. No coronation required.
&#8220;We have all sorts of beginners that start off with one or two horses,&#8221; Figge said. &#8220;We have a polo school where you come out and we&#8217;ll put you on one of our horses and you basically kind of rent the horse for the day.&#8221;
If you want to watch the Twin City Polo Club in action, they have a charity event this Saturday in Watertown.
