Miguel Cabrera hits 2 HR, Detroit Tigers dominate Miguel Cabrera hits 2 HR, Detroit Tigers dominate Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsMLB    The Detroit Tigers looked how the Detroit Tigers are supposed to look in their Labor Day game against the streaking Cleveland Indians. David Price dominated and Miguel Cabrera, the league&rsquo;s best hitter scorched two home runs as Detroit won 12-1.  Price, who became a Tiger on Aug. 1, gave up just one run and eight hits in seven innings. The 2012 Cy Young Winner was coming off a huge loss to New York in which he allowed nine consecutive hits in one inning and eight runs over two. Monday Price took care of negative backlash from that game as he held the sharp hitting Indians to just one run. Cleveland had won six of their last seven games leading them to be just 3.5 games out of the AL Central lead behind Kansas City and Detroit right behind.&nbsp; Miguel Cabrera, who missed the last two games after he was pulled from Saturday&rsquo;s game with an ankle injury, snapped his 27-game homerless streak as he&nbsp;hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Kluber and&nbsp;Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez&nbsp;connected for consecutive shots in the third. Cabrera homered again in the eighth off rookie Bryan Price. Detroit is now 75-62 and is tied with the Kansas City Royals for the AL Central lead. Detroit has won the AL Central the past three years.
