NEW YORK -- Fourth-seeded         David Ferrer became the first top-10 seed to fall in the men's draw of the US Open, losing to         Gilles Simon 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 in the third round Sunday.

Simon, seeded 26th, confounded Ferrer with a variety of shots that kept him out of sync. Ferrer piled up an uncharacteristic 52 unforced errors, nearly twice as many as Simon.

Going into Sunday, none of the top 10 men's seeds had lost, in contrast to the women's side, which had lost half of the top 10.

Earlier, 13th-seeded         Sara Errani used steady shots and her soft serve to reach the quarterfinals, beating 32-year-old qualifier         Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-3, 2-6, 6-0 to end the tournament's most unlikely comeback story.
