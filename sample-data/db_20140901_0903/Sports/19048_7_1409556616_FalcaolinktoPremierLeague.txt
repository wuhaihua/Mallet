			Monaco striker Radamel Falcao has been the subject of frenzied speculation as the summer transfer window enters its final day.The last 24 hours have seen the Columbia forward linked with a host of Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United as well as European champions Real Madrid.Arsene Wenger said Arsenal are in "very active" talks with a striker following his side’s 1-1 draw with Leicester – any deal for Falcao looks likely to include a £20m loan fee.“We want to and we are open to it,” Wenger said. "I don't want to speak about individual cases. We are very active.”Falcao tweeted "Hello Madrid" on Sunday – only to delete it not long afterwards – while reports in Italy claim United are keen to sign him.And City’s interest could be strengthening with Alvaro Negredo looking set to join Valencia on loan.If that deal goes through, Sky Sports' Spanish football pundit Guillem Balague expects City to move for Falcao.Speaking ahead of Barcelona’s game at Villarreal on Sunday evening, Balague told Sky Sports: “Negredo is negotiating with Valencia, with the possibility of going on loan and he is prepared to reduce his wages.“And if that happens, Manchester City will then get Falcao.“That’s the situation that is being negotiated at the moment. Everybody at the moment is still saying it is very unlikely, but Negredo is pushing to go Valencia.”But a source at Manchester City has told Sky Sports News HQ they are not in negotiations with Falcao adding the former Atletico striker will not be going to City in this transfer window.Follow Deadline Day on Sky Sports News HQ for all the latest news as clock ticks down toward the 11pm deadline.
