Shooters could have benefitted from longer training camp abroad: Sanjeev Rajput Shooters could have benefitted from longer training camp abroad: Sanjeev Rajput 
										
		Indian shooter Sanjeev Rajput&nbsp;feels the experience of winning a gold medal in the 2011&nbsp;Changwon World Cup will hold him in good stead when another&nbsp;South Korean city, Incheon, hosts the Asian Games from 19&nbsp;September.
"The 3-position gold I had won in Korea in 2011 will&nbsp;hopefully help. Asian Games is also being held in Korea, so&nbsp;that's a plus point for me," Rajput, who had clinched a silver&nbsp;medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, told PTI.
The 33-year-old Rajput, who hails from Yamunanagar in Haryana, is set to take voluntary retirement from Indian Navy&nbsp;and, "keeping his sporting achievements in mind", is hoping to&nbsp;be recruited as DSP in the state police.

"I will retire voluntarily from navy this year. July 31st&nbsp;I was supposed to retire but I had taken two months extension&nbsp;as I did not want to run around for my release formalities at&nbsp;a time when the Asian Games and World Championships are&nbsp;around," he said.
"I was offered the position of a police inspector in&nbsp;Haryana police but as per my achievements, I believe I should&nbsp;have been made a DSP. I have spoken to the Haryana government,&nbsp;and hope I get better offers in other departments.
"Navy also supported me a lot, there is no more promotion&nbsp;in navy for the next 15 years. In police, I can enter in&nbsp;officer ranks," Rajput added.
Talking about the World Championships, which starts in&nbsp;three days' time in Granada, Spain, Rajput said he was focused&nbsp;on his preparation and was not yet thinking about earning a&nbsp;quota place for the 2016 Rio Olympics. 64 Olympic quota places&nbsp;will be up for grabs at the tournament.
"I have been working hard on my weak positions - leaning&nbsp;and prone position I had some weakness in the past, so I am&nbsp;working on them. I am giving this a lot of time," Rajput, who&nbsp;trained in Hannover after a "brief" stint in the capital,&nbsp;said.
The 2010 Asian Games silver medallist felt the training&nbsp;period could have been longer.
"It could have been much better if that was so. The camp&nbsp;should have been longer, the camp abroad should have been at&nbsp;least 15 days and I am sure our performance would have been&nbsp;much better."
The Commonwealth Games was a different ball game&nbsp;altogether and the competition at Worlds will be much tougher,&nbsp;he felt.
"I would be placed 50th in World Championships with the&nbsp;scores I shot in Glasgow. The competition is of very high&nbsp;level, even higher than Olympics as only two players per&nbsp;country and per event compete in Olympics. In worlds, almost&nbsp;150 players are eliminated on the first day itself."
As far chances of Indian shooters earning quotas were&nbsp;concerned, he said, "Some players are very, very strong in&nbsp;some events. We should get something at least... there are&nbsp;high expectations from us as our standard has gone up in 7-8&nbsp;years."
Thanking non-profit organisation, Olympic Gold Quest&nbsp;(OGQ) for providing him assistance, Rajput picked Jitu Rai,&nbsp;Apurvi Chandela and Ayonika Paul as the ones to watch out for&nbsp;in the upcoming events.
"They have achieved a lot in the last one year, and Jitu&nbsp;especially, will have lots of expectations," said Rajput.
