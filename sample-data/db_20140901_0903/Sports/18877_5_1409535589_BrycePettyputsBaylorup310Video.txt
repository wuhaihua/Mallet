Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The Baylor Bears are beginning their 2014 college football season on Sunday night inside their new home of McLane Stadium, and while the venue might be new, this is still the same old Bears we remember from last season&rsquo;s Big 12 title run. Once again, Bryce Petty and the Bears are blowing out another opponent early on, and this time it&rsquo;s the SMU Mustangs at the receiving end of the beating.  And Petty, normally known for slinging the rock down the field, put his team up over 30 points early in the second quarter, only this time he did it with his legs. Watch in the video below as Petty runs one in from five yards out to extend the lead for his team even more.

But there&rsquo;s no telling how much more we may see of Petty tonight as not only do the Bears continue to have this one in hand, but he was a little shaken up after that scoring run shown above.
