			Former England winger James Simpson-Daniel has been forced to retire due to an ankle injury.The 32-year-old Gloucester man has been on the sidelines since last November, when he suffered the injury during an LV= Cup tie against Newcastle Falcons at Kingsholm.A thrilling player to watch when in full flight, Simpson-Daniel won 10 England caps between 2002 and 2008, but also struggled with injuries at times during his career.He has now decided to retire from the sport, after receiving expert medical advice, and told the Gloucester website: “When I was given the diagnosis by the specialist, they were obviously the last words I wanted to hear.“But I know that I have given it everything and I can't praise the Gloucester Rugby medical staff highly enough."I don't think it's really sunk in yet to be honest, but I have had a really good trot, I can't have any complaints.“It would have been nice to have won more trophies with Gloucester, but I have got so many fantastic memories from my time in the game."I have loved every minute of my time with the club, played and worked with so many great people, made so many friends and, of course, played my home games at the best home ground in club rugby, Kingsholm."That is what I will miss the most - that roar as you exit the tunnel and run on to the pitch.“The Gloucester supporters have always been fantastic to me and I will always be grateful but it is now time to start on a new chapter.“I will take my time and consider my options, but, whatever I do, Gloucester Rugby will always be a huge part of my life."A Gloucester great, Simpson-Daniel joined the club as a teenager straight from Sedbergh School, and went on to make around 250 starts across 14 seasons, scoring 118 tries.Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys said: “He was a unique talent.“I played against him and, even though he was an opponent who could really hurt you on the pitch, he was a joy to watch."It's a real blow for him and, personally, I'm disappointed that he's had to retire before I had the opportunity to enjoy seeing him play as a colleague but his influence on this Gloucester Rugby side will continue to be felt.“He's helped to develop and mentor the likes of Jonny May and Charlie Sharples, both international wingers in their own right, and he will have inspired countless others to play the game."On behalf of everyone at Gloucester Rugby, I'd like to thank him for everything he's done for the club and wish him all the very best for the future."
