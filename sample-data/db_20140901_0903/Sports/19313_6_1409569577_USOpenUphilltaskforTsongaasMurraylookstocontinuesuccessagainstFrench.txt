US Open: Uphill task for Tsonga as Murray looks to continue success against French US Open: Uphill task for Tsonga as Murray looks to continue success against French 
										
		No one loves beating up on French players quite like Andy Murray.
Until losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto last month, Murray had won 18 straight matches against French players.

His career record against the French is 67-13 and between losing to Tsonga in the first round of the Australian Open in 2008 and to Richard Gasquet in the Paris Masters in 2012, he compiled a 38-1 record against Frenchmen.
As he and Tsonga prepare for their fourth-round encounter at the U.S. Open on Monday, Murray has a 9-2 career lead.
&ldquo;I've had a lot of close matches with him but I've won a lot against him, as well, so yeah, I would say (my game) matches up well,&rdquo; Murray said.
The Scotsman said he was not concerned by the fact that he has not beaten a top-10 player since his win over Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final in 2013.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve beaten many top 10 players over the course of my career in these events and I&rsquo;m sure it will happen again, and happen soon,&rdquo; he said.
Top seed Djokovic takes on Germany&rsquo;s Philipp Kohlschreiber for the right to play Murray or Tsonga.
Women&rsquo;s top seed Serena Williams continues her quest for a third consecutive U.S. Open title against Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.
With six of the top eight seeds gone from the women&rsquo;s draw, Williams is aware of the dangers that can be lurking, not least since she has failed to reach the quarter-finals of any of the grand slams this year.
&ldquo;I've been a casualty this whole year at grand slams,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm just hoping to keep staying in there.&rdquo;
