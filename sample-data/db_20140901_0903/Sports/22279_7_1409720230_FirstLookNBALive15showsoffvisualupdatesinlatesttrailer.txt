                    EA Sports&#39; NBA Live series is in year two of its return to consoles after a break. Are these newly-released visuals enough to draw you back into the franchise? The detail on Damian Lillard is incredible. (As it should be; he landed the EA cover.)



NBA Live 15 drops on Oct. 7 for PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
