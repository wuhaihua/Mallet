Top 2016 recruit Jayson Tatum puts Illini on top-10 list Top 2016 recruit Jayson Tatum puts Illini on top-10 list  We're not long removed from Stevenson point guard Jalen Brunson's visit to Illinois this past weekend, but already another prized recruit is catching the eyes of Illini fans.
Jayson Tatum, a five-star shooting guard out of St. Louis, included the Illini in his final list of 10 schools, posted Monday morning on Twitter.

The list includes no other Big Ten teams, though basketball powers Arizona, Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina and UConn all made the cut. Then there's home-state schools St. Louis and Missouri to go along with Wake Forest.
It's an impressive list for sure.

Rivals currently ranks Tatum as the fourth best player in the country in the Class of 2016. While John Groce has yet to make a massive recruiting splash in his two seasons in Champaign, he seems to be getting close. Illinois was the first official visit and one of only five for Brunson, the top-ranked point guard in the Class of 2015. And now Tatum has included the Illini in some elite company.
While a lot would have to happen, Illini fans have to already be dreaming about the possibility of Brunson and Tatum teaming up in the same backcourt for the orange and blue.
