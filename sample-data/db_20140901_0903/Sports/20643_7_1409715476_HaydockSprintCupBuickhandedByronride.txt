			Tom Hogan reports last year's winner Gordon Lord Byron is likely to be ridden by William Buick in Saturday's Betfred Sprint Cup at Haydock.Buick has a strong record on the six-year-old having won twice from six previous outings and was last on board the globetrotting performer when eighth in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in June.Tom Hogan has had another crack at this weekend's feature in mind for Gordon Lord Byron all season and is hoping Buick will be available for ride.The trainer told sportinglife.com: "Shane Foley rode him on Sunday in a piece of work at the weekend and he reckons he's in top form. We couldn't be happier with him."Basically the jockey for Saturday is Willam Buick, but that's presuming Gregorian won't run. Otherwise there's plenty of jockeys there who have ridden him before."Joseph O'Brien, Ryan Moore and Wayne Lordan have all ridden him so there's some top-class jockeys that know the horse well. He's not a difficult ride anyway."Looking further down the line, Hogan is keen to return to Sha Tin later in the year for the Hong Kong Mile, in which he was fourth last year.Hogan said: "We have lots of options later on. It's nailed on I'd say we'll be in Hong Kong in December but where we go this side of that is still open - there's plenty of options for him."Since he's a gelding, we must try and follow the money."
