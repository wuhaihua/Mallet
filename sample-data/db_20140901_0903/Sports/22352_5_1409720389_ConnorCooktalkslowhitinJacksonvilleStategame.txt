Connor Cook talks low hit in Jacksonville State game Connor Cook talks low hit in Jacksonville State game Aug 29, 2014; East Lansing, MI, USA; Michigan State Spartans quarterback Connor Cook (18) scrabbles out of the pocket against the Jacksonville State Gamecocks during the 1st quarter of a game at Spartan Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Carter-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    This Michigan State Spartans opened up their 2014 season in successful fashion last Friday night with a 45-7 win over Jacksonville State. However, early on, they nearly lost their most key player on offense when QB Connor Cook took a low shot to the knees from Jacksonville State defensive back Folo Johnson.  When the play was replayed on television, you could clearly see that the hit was malicious, and was one that has absolutely no place in the game of football, at any level. And apparently, it came across that way to Cook as well. &ldquo;I thought it was a pretty bad cheap shot,&rdquo;&nbsp;Cook&nbsp;told&nbsp;ESPN.com&nbsp;on Tuesday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of hits, growing up, watching TV and stuff like that. I&rsquo;ve never seen a hit like that, so low and so late. I thought it was a really dirty hit. But I&rsquo;m glad things aren&rsquo;t as bad as it looked.&rdquo; When the hit took place, you could almost hear the entire Michigan State fan base hold their breath as their quarterback limped off to the sideline. But just a few minutes later, Cook appeared okay, and even returned to the field and immediately fired off a touchdown pass. Thankfully, Cook was not injured, because the Spartans have the toughest task of anyone this week as they head out to Eugene to face the third-ranked Oregon Ducks.
