In today&#39;s show, co-hosts Matt Lutovsky (@MLutovsky) and Troy Machir (@TroyMachir) discuss:


	The opening weekend of&nbsp;the college football season
	Is Florida State vulnerable or is Oklahoma State better than we thought? Or neither? Or both?
	North Dakota State slaying another &ldquo;giant&rdquo;
	Georgia&#39;s Todd Gurley instantly achieving folklore status thanks to a weird coaching decision
	Wisconsin&#39;s Melvin Gordon losing folklore status thanks to a weird coaching decision
	The opening of the NFL season
	Loosely organized playoff predictions
	The one rookie quarterback who will be starting this week
	Our Sporting News Experts League fantasy draft
	The Phillies&#39; team no-hitter


We also play another round of &ldquo;Is ____ Cool?&rdquo;. Today&#39;s subject: Pete Carroll. He&#39;s 62 but looks much younger; he&#39;s energetic but may be hiding some personal demons; he&#39;s charitable but plays practical jokes. This is tough. Click here to go that to this segment.

We finish up by chatting with NFL Network analysis and Hall-of-Famer Marshall Faulk, who&#39;s promoting the SAP Player Comparison Tool, which gives fantasy football owners real-time insight to help them make better decisions. It&#39;s free and available on NFL.com&#39;s fantasy platforms

We also talk to Marshall about his first experiences with people telling him he was on their fantasy teams, how much he trusts his gut when drafting and setting his lineup, the only running back in the league he thinks could have 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season, whether he thinks Adrian Peterson will be hurt by the Vikings&#39; move to an outdoor stadium, why the NFL Network&#39;s pre-game show is arguably the best on TV, and much more. Marshall&#39;s interview starts at the 32:58&nbsp;mark of the show. Click here to go right to Marshall&#39;s interview.

We also talk about being held hostage by the NFL for the next four months, which superpowers you&#39;d like (including not having to go to the bathroom), Mickey Mouse&#39;s voice, why the Redskins should start Kirk Cousins this week, practical jokers, and, of course, hiring hookers just to cry to them.
