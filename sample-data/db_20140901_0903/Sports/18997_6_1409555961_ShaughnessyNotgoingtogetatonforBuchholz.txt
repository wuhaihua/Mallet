Shaughnessy: ‘Not going to get a ton' for Buchholz Shaughnessy: ‘Not going to get a ton' for Buchholz September 1, 2014, 1:15 am When Jon Lester was traded by the Red Sox, the team hoped Clay Buchholz could step up into the role of ace of the pitching staff.
On Sunday, Clay Buchholz put together his second impressive start in the month of August.
On The Baseball Show, Lou Merloni wondered if the team can trust Buchholz as the ace of the rotation. 
"It's hit or miss. There's nothing in-between," said Merloni. "It's either, this guy is one of the best pitchers in the game with top-level stuff, elite stuff.  Or he can't get out of his own way, it's a 5-hour game, guy gets on base and he loses his mind.  It's the biggest tease I've ever seen." 
Should the team look to deal the 30-year-old?
"I think it comes down to how they really feel about this guy," said Merloni. "If they think he's that inconsistent on the mound, and maybe personally, emotionally, who knows.  Him throwing the ball well could be a good thing. They might actually think of having someone else deal with him." 
Dan Shaughnessy doesn't believe the Red Sox will part ways with Buchholz. 
"He was a 17-game winner in 2010," said Shaughnessy. "IT's a tough guy to read, but I don't think they're in any position to deal him at this point.  You might be selling really low… You're not going to get a ton for him now based on the inconsistency."
