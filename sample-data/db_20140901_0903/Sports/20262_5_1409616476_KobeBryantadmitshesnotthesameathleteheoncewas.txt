Kobe Bryant admits he's not the same athlete he once was Kobe Bryant admits he's not the same athlete he once was Dec 8, 2013; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant (24) reacts during the second half against the Toronto Raptors at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Richard Mackson-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant is 36 years old and fresh off back-to-back seasons in which he suffered season-ending injuries.  Naturally, when the 2014-15 NBA season rolls around, Bryant will be a different player than he was years ago when he was in his prime. Bryant, in a self-aware moment, admitted as much during an interview in China, according to insidesocal.com.  &ldquo;I can say I want to be able to jump as high as I used to. I want to be as fast as I used to. But no; I don&rsquo;t jump as high as I used to,&rdquo; Bryant said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m not as fast as I used to be. That&rsquo;s okay, too. I&rsquo;ll figure out another way to do it.&rdquo;  Bryant made similar comments recently to Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated, suggesting that his basketball IQ would help him remain a top player.  I&rsquo;ll be sharper,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Much sharper. Much more efficient in areas. I&rsquo;ll be limited in terms of what you see me do, versus a couple years ago. But very, very methodical, very, very purposeful.&rdquo;  It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone that Bryant, one of the most confident players&nbsp;of this NBA era, believe&rsquo;s he can overcome his lost athleticism going forward. Whether he&rsquo;ll ultimately be accurate remains another story. Kobe will still be a productive player, but he&rsquo;s clearly declined in ability in recent years and simply doesn&rsquo;t stack up to the top guys in the game anymore. However, Kobe has proved many wrong before and it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if he can do so again in 2014-15.
