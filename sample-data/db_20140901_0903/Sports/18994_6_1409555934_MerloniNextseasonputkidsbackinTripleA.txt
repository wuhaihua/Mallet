Merloni: Next season, put kids back in Triple-A Merloni: Next season, put kids back in Triple-A August 31, 2014, 11:00 pm The Red Sox came into the 2014 season with a very young roster.
With many of the rookies on the roster struggling, Lou Merloni has an idea to give the team a little more experience on their Major League roster in 2015.
"Put an entire team together next year," said Merloni. "Take every single one of these kids that you got a look at this year and put them right back in Triple-A.  Every single last one of them. That includes Xander Bogaerts, who I think is going to be a great player."
Dan Shaughnessy agreed with Merloni. 
"Guys didn't get enough at bats in the minor leagues and they brought them up not ready," said Shaughnessy. "That has come home to roost in a big way. Bradley clearly, Bogaerts again, and moving guys out of position.  Betts is an infielder trying out at center field in the big leagues.  They're doing this all over the place. I just can't believe baseball ops. is chaotic and disorganized in this season. I think they'll get their act together in a better way next year."
