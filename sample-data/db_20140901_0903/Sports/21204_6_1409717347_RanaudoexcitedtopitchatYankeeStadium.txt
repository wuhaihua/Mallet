Ranaudo excited to pitch at Yankee Stadium Ranaudo excited to pitch at Yankee Stadium September 2, 2014, 6:00 pm NEW YORK -- Anthony Ranaudo will get a chance to improve to 4-0 Wednesday when he makes his fourth big league start.
"As far as my confidence and comfort out there,'' said Ranaudo,  "I think I've definitely made some big strides. I think I've been consistent. I try to go out there and go as deep as I can in the game and my mindset every time I take the ball is to go as deep as I can into the game and give our team a chance to win.
"Each game dictates the kind of stuff that you'll have and the aggressiveness and the approach that you'll have out there. So I just let that come to me and, like I said, try to go as deep as I can into games and put our team in a position to win.''
A native of New Jersey, Ranaudo faced the Yankees at Fenway Park in his first major league start on Aug. 1. Now, he'll get a chance to pitch against them again, this time at Yankee Stadium.
"I can't even describe how excited I'm going to be,'' he said. "It'll be pretty interesting tonight when I put my head on that pillow and see if I can fall asleep. There's going to be a lot of emotions, but I'm just going to take it like it's another game and do the things that have made me successful to this point.''
Ranaudo's parents were at Fenway for his debut last month, and of course will be at the Stadium tonight, along with other friends and family members.
It's been a hectic last few days for Ranaudo, who pitched last Friday in Tampa, was optioned to Greenville to create a roster spot, and flew from South Carolina to New York Monday.
"I just take it as it is,'' said Ranaudo. "Every time I get a chance to go out on the mound, it's an opportunity. All those other things, I can't control, so I try to focus on the things I can control -- executing pitches and going as deep as I can. I try to keep he uncontrollables out of my head the best I can and keep it simple.''
The fact that Ranaudo has already faced the Yankees once will help him prepare for Wednesday night.
"It's huge,'' he said. "It's pretty comforting to know that I pitched against their lineup, went through it two or three times and I just watched some (video) on them. In my first start against them, obviously I had to watch some other guys pitch against them. But this time, I'm able to watch myself and watch my pitches and how guys took swing off me and how they approached me. That's huge for me.''
As nervous as he might be Wednesday night, Ranaudo contended that he won't be as anxious as he was watching his alma mater LSU have to rally to pull out its football opener against Wisconsin last weekend.
"That fourth quarter, I was debating whether to turn the TV off,'' he joked. "But it was their first game of the year and I had to stick with me and they made me proud, so that was good.''
