To be young and able to jump out of the gym must be nice, but I am neither young or able to jump over a phone book.
Kwe Parker on the other hand has both skills at hand. Parker, who is in the class of 2016, has some of the best hops I have ever seen &#8212; yes, even as good as Vince Carter.
Parker, who has offers from Clemson, Virginia Tech, Boston College and Wake Forest, has a mixtape for the ages.
What do you think of Parker&#8217;s mixtape?
