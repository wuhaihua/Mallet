Giants scratch Morse, Bochy proud of bullpen in suspended game victory Giants scratch Morse, Bochy proud of bullpen in suspended game victory DENVER – Michael Morse was scratched from Monday’s second game at Coors Field after experiencing soreness in his left hip during batting practice, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.
Morse was taken out in a designed double switch in the resumption of the May 22 suspended game, but that move was preconceived so Jeremy Affeldt could pitch multiple innings without his turn in the batting order coming up. Affeldt retired all four hitters he faced and Hunter Pence hit a tiebreaking double in a 4-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies.
Bochy had planned for Morse to start at first base in the regularly scheduled Labor Day matinee, with Tim Hudson on the mound. Joaquin Arias gets the start instead, against left-hander Franklin Morales.
As the two clubs prepared for the first pitch, Bochy said he was proud of how his club handled the resumption of the suspended game, which was 2-2 with two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning when rain and tornado warnings halted proceedings back on May 22.
“It started with Affeldt,” Bochy said. “He had good stuff and really set the tone there.”
Their winning rally in the eighth began when Andrew Susac hit a leadoff single. It’ll count on May 22, along with all other stats from the game – meaning Susac’s first big league hit came two months before his major league debut.
“We were talking about it on the bench,” Bochy said. “That kid wasn’t even close to being here when this game started. … A lot of guys weren’t close to being here.”
The Giants officially finished May with a 20-9 record.
