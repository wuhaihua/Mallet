                    The NFL announced it has fined Jim Irsay $500,000 and suspended him six games for violating the league&#39;s personal-conduct policy.

The Indianapolis Colts owner had just pled&nbsp;guilty to a misdemeanor charge of operating a vehicle while intoxicated on Monday morning. It stems from his March 16 arrest, for which&nbsp;court evidence showed he had two painkillers, oxycodone and hyrdocodone, in his system at the time.

It was no surprise that the league and commissioner Roger Goodell had a swift response after Irsay made his plea bargain agreement, changing from two not guilty pleas. The case, for all the NFL&#39;s intents and purposes, was closed at that point.

Given the speed and timing of the decision afterward,&nbsp;you can bet the NFL had been mulling over discipline for Irsay for a while. Although the league can only do so much to hamper a billionaire owner, the money and the suspension should be enough to please the union that Goodell isn&#39;t taking it easier on the owners for which he works.

Irsay will be only eligible to return to the Colts after their game against Houston on Oct. 9.&nbsp;

According to the league release, the stipulations of Irsay&#39;s supension are as follows:&nbsp;It goes into effect at 5 p.m. ET Wednesday. Irsay isn&#39;t allowed to be&nbsp;at the team&rsquo;s facility, attend any practices or games or&nbsp;represent the league/team and such&nbsp;meetings and events. He also cannot conduct media interviews or engage in social media regarding any team or league matters.

The latter affects Irsay more than other owners, given his active presence on Twitter.&nbsp;Irsay also will be subject to ongoing medical treatment, counseling, and testing at the discretion of an Indiana court.&nbsp;

This was the statement Goodell made in a letter sent to Irsay, per the NFL

&nbsp;&ldquo;I have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players,&quot; Goodell wrote.&nbsp;&quot;We discussed&nbsp;this during our meeting and you expressed your support for that view, volunteering that owners should be held to the highest standard.&rdquo;
