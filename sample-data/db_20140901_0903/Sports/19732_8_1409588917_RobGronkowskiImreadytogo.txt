Rob Gronkowski said Monday that he's been cleared to play in the         New England Patriots' opener Sunday against the         Miami Dolphins.

"I'm ready to go," the Patriots' star tight end said. "I'll be playing."

     

Gronkowski underwent surgery on his torn right ACL Jan. 9 and returned to full-team drills for the first time on Aug. 18.

He said he was "super excited, super pumped" to be cleared for game action.

"I feel mentally and physically ready, for sure. No doubt about it," he said.

Gronkowski said he won't be playing every snap but he's ready to return.

"My mentality now is I'm ready to go, I'm ready to be out there, I'm ready to hit, I'm ready to start going," he said.
