Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsUS Open    Entering Day 9 of the 2014 US Open, 17 year old Belinda Bencic has an opportunity to continue a historic run as she kicks off the women&rsquo;s quarterfinals at the tournament against China&rsquo;s Shuai Peng. The Swiss born teenager reached the quarterfinals after a shocking win over&nbsp;ninth-seeded Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (6), 6-3 in the Round of 16.&nbsp; With the upset win and quarterfinals berth, Bencic has become&nbsp;the youngest US Open quarter-finalist since Martina Hingis won the title in 1997 when she was just&nbsp;16 years old. Interestingly enough, Bencic has some additional ties to Hingis as well. Hingis&rsquo; mother, Melanie Molitor, is one of Bencic&rsquo;s coaches. Molitor coached Hingis when she won the US Open back in 1997 and it would be incredible to see Molitor lead another player who is playing well beyond her years to the final match once again. Bencic and Peng will square off shortly after noon ET at Arthur Ashe Stadium for the morning session. Live coverage of today&rsquo;s matches will begin at 11 a.m. ET on ESPN and the Tennis Channel. When the action shifts to primetime, you will need to flip back over to ESPN.
