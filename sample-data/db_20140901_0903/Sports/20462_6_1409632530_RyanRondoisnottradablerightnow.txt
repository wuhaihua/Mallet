Ryan: Rondo is 'not tradable right now' Ryan: Rondo is 'not tradable right now' September 2, 2014, 12:15 am On Sunday, a report emerged saying Rajon Rondo wanted to leave Boston.
Rondo's representatives quickly denied the report, but not before the basketball world started discussing the possibility of Rondo being traded.
Bob Ryan joined Arbella Early Edition to explain why he doesn't expect the point guard to be traded early in the season.
"It doesn't matter if he wants to be traded," said Ryan. "They're not trading him. He's not tradable right now.  Nobody's seen him play and that's that.  If he is traded, it will be at the trading deadline."
"You can't trade him until somebody has looked at him and see what you're getting. Because it certainly was inconclusive based on what we saw at the end of last year."  On Sunday, a report emerged saying Rajon Rondo wanted to leave Boston.
