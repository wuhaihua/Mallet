Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY SportsEPL    QPR manager Harry Redknapp is reportedly looking to reunite with Jermain Defoe, and will bid for the Toronto FC forward ahead of the September 1 deadline. Jermain Defoe played under Redknapp&rsquo;s tutelage during stints at Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur, and has been successful since joining the MLS in winter 2014. Defoe has thusfar scored 11 goals in 16 MLS appearances, continuing his reputation as a prolific goalscorer. The news comes just days after Toronto Star reported that Defoe is out for several weeks with a lingering groin injury, which could potentially put off Harry Redknapp or, alternatively, cause the failure of a potential medical. Toronto FC manager Ryan Nelsen was recently dismissed, with the former Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn Rovers defender being replaced by Greg Vanney. With a winning percentage of just 26.32%, Nelsen has struggled since transitioning into management despite recruiting the likes of Jermain Defoe and Michael Bradley. According to The Guardian, Defoe could be available for around &pound;6.6 million ($11 million) and Toronto GM&nbsp;Tim Bezbatchenko confirmed that the club have received bids. &ldquo;We have received multiple offers for Jermain Defoe and we will make a decision on this in the next 24 hours.&rdquo; While Bezbatchenko&rsquo;s comments suggest that QPR aren&rsquo;t the only side interested in Defoe&rsquo;s services, the former England international&rsquo;s relationship with Harry Redknapp could help smooth a potential deal for the Toronto FC forward.
