That&rsquo;s the word from Dragic himself who simply wants to win and has no problem having his floor time reduced, assuming the Phoenix Suns can keep racking up the wins. &ldquo;Last season we won 48 games and if we were in the East, we had been the third seed,&rdquo; said Dragic. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s basketball. I would take fewer minutes if we make it to the playoffs. Minutes don&rsquo;t matter for me as long as team is playing well. The main goal is to make it to the playoffs because two seasons ago we were losing a lot, last year we won 48 games and now we are in the different situation.&rdquo; Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve heard a player make such a claim though it often never works out as suggested. The only reason Dragic would really need to play less minutes is if the Suns were able to retain Eric Bledsoe and wanted he and Isaiah Thomas to be the starting backcourt. Even then, it seems likely the Suns will be able to work out a rotation which could net all three around 30-minutes per game, so it&rsquo;s doubtful a reduction in playing time will be necessary. More than that, Goran Dragic has proven himself to be a vital necessity for the Phoenix Suns and it seems doubtful they&rsquo;d want to give him any less time.
