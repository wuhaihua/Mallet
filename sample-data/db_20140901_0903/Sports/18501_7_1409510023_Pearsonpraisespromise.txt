			Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson hailed the promise of his side after they came from behind to draw against Arsenal.The Gunners took the lead at the King Power Stadium via Alexis Sanchez on 20 minutes but two minutes later Leo Ulloa equalised for the Premier League new-boys.While Arsenal created the better of the chances in the second half, substitute Jamie Vardy went close to winning it for Leicester only to be denied by Wojciech Szczesny as the Foxes picked up their second point of their campaign.Â Pearson is looking for his side to learn quickly as they adapt to life in the top-flight, telling Sky Sports: "It was another illustration of how difficult the Premier League can be."We feel that we've played pretty well - I think we've played better, I think we've been more assured in possession than we have been today - but we've still had flashes of the ability to create things which is going to be pivotal for us this season."You cannot go into the Premier League and think you've got to keep it tight all the time."You've got to be able to create opportunities and we felt that even though against a very good possession side, we still worked hard and did all the hard work that you need to do out of possession."We still felt that we looked dangerous on the counter, from set-plays and occasionally with some decent moves."So there's a lot of promise there but it is how quickly we can learn and then put it into practice when we play the next game."
