New Mexico State's horse knocks over female student (video) New Mexico State's horse knocks over female student (video) NCAA Football    The New Mexico State Aggies have a horse named Keystone that their mascot, Pistol Pete, rides around the field in pregame ceremonies. Things went a little awry before Thursday&rsquo;s season opener vs. Cal Poly.  Keystone cut the corner a little short in the end zone, and clipped student Zaina Atyani, who works for the athletics marketing department. Atyani never saw it coming. She was busy coordinating pregame activities on the field.  You can call it payback for Alex Karras&rsquo;s character Mongo punching out a horse in the Mel Brooks classic&nbsp;Blazing Saddles. She earned the dubious distinction of being the first student knocked to the new turf in Aggie Memorial Stadium. Atyani took the collision in stride, and even made light of it in a Twitter post: &nbsp; Just got knocked out by a horse. No big deal. &mdash; Zaina Atyani (@ZainaAtyani) August 29, 2014 ESPN even awarded her with a spot on Friday&rsquo;s version of the Not Top 10. At least the football team rewarded Atyani and the rest of the New Mexico State faithful with a 28-10 win over Cal Poly from San Luis Obispo. New Mexico State already has half of their win total from all of last season! The Aggies will travel to Atlanta next week to take on Georgia State on Saturday. &nbsp;
