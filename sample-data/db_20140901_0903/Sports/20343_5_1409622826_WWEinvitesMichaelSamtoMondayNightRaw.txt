WWE invites Michael Sam to Monday Night Raw WWE invites Michael Sam to Monday Night Raw Aug 28, 2014; Miami Gardens, FL, USA; St. Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam (96) looks on prior to a game against the Miami Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsNFL    When the St. Louis Rams drafted former Missouri Tigers&rsquo; defensive end Michael Sam, he became the NFL&rsquo;s first openly gay player.  Sam was an absolute monster for the Tigers in 2013.&nbsp;He made 48 tackles, including 11.5 sacks and helped lead the Tigers to an SEC East Title and a berth in the SEC Championship Game, where they fell to the Auburn Tigers. Sam was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Year. Sam played mostly in the second half of games in the 2014 preseason and performed well at times. That clearly&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t enough for the Rams, who released Sam over the weekend. Sam went on waivers but was not claimed and there has been talk he could wind up on a practice squad and the CFL has even reportedly tried to contact him. However, the next time we see Sam on television, it may be in a wrestling ring. During Monday night&rsquo;s Raw, the WWE officially invited Sam to join them on their show next Monday. They also posted the message on their official twitter account. 2013 @SEC Defensive Player of Year &amp; @NFL @STLouisRams draft pick @MichaelSamNFL invited to @WWE #RAW next week! pic.twitter.com/mbaJy4WuR4 &mdash; WWE (@WWE) September 2, 2014   We invite @MichaelSamNFL to @wwe Raw!
