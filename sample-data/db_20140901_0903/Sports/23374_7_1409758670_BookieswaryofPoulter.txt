			Europe wildcard pick Ian Poulter is a 12/1 shot with Sky Bet to be the overall top points scorer at the 40th Ryder Cup later this month.The Englishman was confirmed as one of Europe captain Paul McGinley's three picks for the Gleneagles showpiece alongside Stephen Gallacher and Lee Westwood. American captain Tom Watson selected Webb Simpson, Keegan Bradley and Hunter Mahan to the US team earlier this morning.Poulter has a tremendous record in the Ryder Cup, winning 12 of his 15 matches and was a leading light in Europe's remarkable victory at Medinah in 2012.The 38-year-old’s outstanding form in the event means he only trails World No1 Rory McIlroy (7/1) and Justin Rose (11/1), meaning he is the same price as USA’s favourites, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson, in the betting to secure the most points in the biennial clash.Poulter is also odds-on with Sky Bet to be the best of Europe's wildcards at 4/5 and 9/4 to be the best wildcard in the event, ahead of Bradley at 3/1, Westwood at 4/1, Mahan and Simpson at 6/1 and Scotland’s Gallacher at 9/1.Must-pickSky Bet's John Rhodes said: "Poulter's record in the event made him a must-pick for McGinley and we have to give him maximum respect in all markets."Whatever happens at Gleneagles, his performance at Medinah will mark him down as an all-time great in Ryder Cup terms and he's the best of the six wildcards."Each side has named three rookies, and it's Jamie Donaldson who is considered the pick of the Europeans at 11/8 to outscore 2/1 shots Victor Dubuisson and Gallacher. For America, Jordan Spieth (5/4) heads Jimmy Walker (7/4) and Patrick Reed (5/2).Sky Bet also offer correct score betting and with each of the last two renewals having ended 14.5-13.5 to Europe, that option is likely to once again be popular at 15/2.Europe remain the odds-on favourites to retain the trophy with the USA 7/4 shots and the tie available at 10/1.
