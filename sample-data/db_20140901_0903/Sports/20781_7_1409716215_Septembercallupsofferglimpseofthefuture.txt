                    Big league clubs wasted no time in promoting a number of top prospects as soon as rosters expanded yesterday. While more moves are certainly in store and several elite prospects (Francisco Lindor, Andrew Heaney, Archie Bradley, and Domingo Santana to name a few) remained in the minors at least for now, the following are the September 1 rookie call-ups who are most worth tracking.

Top Prospects

Taijuan Walker, SP, Mariners. Hours after announcing that Walker would pitch out of the bullpen down the stretch, the Mariners threw the rookie into the breach Monday when starter Chris Young failed to make it out of the first inning. Walker didn&#39;t disappoint, hurling six innings of one-run ball while showing much-improved command. With Seattle very much in the thick of the race, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise to see Walker replace the struggling Young. Long-term, Walker&#39;s plus fastball, devastating cutter and above-average off-speed offerings profile as a front-of-the-rotation ace. This month he should see a decent workload and he&#39;ll have serious value if he&#39;s slotted into the rotation.

Maikel Franco, 3B, Phillies. After a slow start to the year, Franco had an impressive second half at Triple-A and now stands a chance of getting regular playing time at third base with the Phillies for the remainder of the season. Franco is Philadelphia&#39;s top prospect and the club is likely to give him a long look this month. Despite his blistering second half, Franco still has problems with plate discipline and his long swing can be exploited by advanced pitching. He&#39;ll probably be streaky this month but should post decent power numbers if he sees regular time. Long-term, his plate discipline will determine whether he reaches his 30-home run potential.

Joc Pederson, OF, Dodgers. Pederson posted a monster season at Triple-A (.303 average with 33 HR and 30 SB), but he&#39;s unlikely to see much playing time with the Dodgers this month. LA&#39;s outfield is crowded and Pederson will probably just get an occasional start with the Dodgers in the thick of the playoff race. Long-term he has all-star potential, but we&#39;ll probably have to wait until 2015 to see it.

Alex Guerrero, 2B/OF, Dodgers. While Guerrero&#39;s defensive limitations mean he&#39;s unlikely to start every day, he could fill a utility role down the stretch. With solid power and good bat speed, Guerrero is an above-average hitter who could bat .270 and slug 15-20 home runs over a full season. This month he could have value if he sees regular time.

Daniel Norris, SP, Blue Jays. Norris will work out of the bullpen this month and could have value if the Jays existing relief corps continues to scuffle. By handing late-inning duties to Aaron Sanchez, Toronto has already shown that it is willing to put a rookie in high-leverage situations. Long-term, Norris&#39; big fastball, three-pitch mix, and improved command profile as a No. 2 or No. 3 starter. In the meantime, he could be a dominant late-inning arm for the Jays this month.

Jesus Aguilar, 1B/DH, Indians. Aguilar struggled in an early-season call-up but he put up good numbers at Triple-A (.304/.395/.511) while showing improved plate discipline (96/64 K/BB). The Indians still have an outside shot at a wild card, and they haven&#39;t received much from their DH spot this year. If Aguilar produces right away he could see regular playing time at DH and/or 1B. He won&#39;t match his Triple-A numbers in the bigs but .260 and 25 bombs is a realistic upside for a full season.

Billy Burns, OF, Athletics. He floundered after a mid-season promotion to Triple-A and there are real questions about his future role but, with 54 stolen bases in the minors this season, there&#39;s no doubting his plus speed. He&#39;s not Billy Hamilton, but he could be used as a pinch runner the way the Reds&#39; speedster was last September. He&#39;s no lock to have value, but he&#39;s worth tracking as a potential source of cheap steals.

Cory Spangenberg, 2B, Padres. Spangenberg got the start at third base yesterday and drove in two runs while going 1-for-4 at the plate. The versatile middle-infielder doesn&#39;t have great upside but with solid bat control, good plate discipline and plus speed he profiles as a league-average second baseman. The Padres have a crowded infield, but if Spangenberg continues to produce he could see regular at bats and should contribute with average, runs, and steals.

Steven Moya, OF, Tigers. Moya singled in his first big-league at-bat, but a crowded Detroit outfield will limit his opportunities. Moya has plus power (35 home runs at Double-A this season), but he also is a free swinger prone to whiffs. Moya&#39;s athleticism and raw power make him an intriguing prospect, but he&#39;ll need to shorten his swing and tighten his plate discipline to succeed in the majors.
