                    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina&nbsp;&mdash; Lionel Messi has been ruled out of Wednesday&#39;s international friendly against World Cup winners Germany with a right-leg injury.

The Argentine Football Association confirmed his absence on Monday and called it a &quot;precaution.&quot;

The match in Dusseldorf is a chance for Argentina to avenge a 1-0 loss to Germany in extra time in the World Cup final almost two months ago.

Messi was injured on Sunday in Barcelona&#39;s 1-0 victory over Villarreal.
