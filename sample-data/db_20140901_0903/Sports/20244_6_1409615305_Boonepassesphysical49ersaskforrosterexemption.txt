The 49ers asked for a roster exemption for guard Alex Boone, who signed a new contract Monday to end the holdout that lasted the entire offseason and training camp, the club announced.
The club is expected to place nose tackle Glenn Dorsey on injured reserve/designated for return to open a spot for Boone on the team’s 53-man roster. Beginning Tuesday, teams are allowed to use the designation on one player.
Coach Jim Harbaugh on Aug. 22 said the 49ers expect a 3 ½-month timetable for Dorsey, who underwent surgery on Aug. 4 to repair a torn biceps. Dorsey is expected to be available in late-November or early-December. Players on IR/designated for return are allowed to return to play any time after eight weeks.
Boone must be elevated to the 53-man roster to be eligible to play. That move could happen as early as Tuesday. The 49ers are expected to decided whether to play Boone in the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys based on how he looks in practices this week. Third-year player Joe Looney has worked with the starters for the entirety of Boone's absence.

Boone passed his physical on Monday and signed a contract in which he is scheduled to make base salaries totaling $6 million over the next two seasons, a source said. If he remained as the starter, Boone’s incentives would have enabled him to earn $5.75 million during that time.
The 49ers rolled his next two years of incentives into base salaries. The 49ers also waived the more than $1 million in fines that Boone accumulated during his holdout.
