Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsNBA    The Los Angeles Clippers have a new owner, have locked down head coach Doc Rivers and are gearing up to make a serious run at the NBA Finals this year.  One thing that the Clippers need is veteran help and that&rsquo;s why they decided to roll with Hedo Turkoglu last year. He wasn&rsquo;t a superstar with the Clippers but he was serviceable and that&rsquo;s all Los Angeles really needed out of him. But while he would come cheap, L.A. held off on trying to sign Turkoglu this summer and that seems to be changing. According to Adrian Wojnarowski from Yahoo! Sports, the Clippers are close to bringing back Turkoglu for another season after letting him twist in the wind this offseason.  Free-agent forward Hedo Turkoglu is nearing agreement on a one-year, $1.4 million deal to return to the Los Angeles Clippers, league sources told Yahoo Sports. After working out a contract buyout with the Orlando Magic and signing with the Clippers in January, Turkoglu, 35, averaged three points in 38 games.  Turkoglu is needed not only for his veteran presence but also because he helps fill a roster spot that the Clippers need to fill. They have two open spots on their roster and while one may or may not be earmarked for Ray Allen, it seems that Turkoglu will be filling the other slot.
