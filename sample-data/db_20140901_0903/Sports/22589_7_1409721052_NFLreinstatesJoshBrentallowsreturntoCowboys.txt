                    Former Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent is being allowed to return to the NFL, though he won&#39;t play right away.

The NFL on Tuesday outlined a series of conditions Brent must meet to be eligible to play when the Cowboys return from their bye week in November. Brent retired last year and was sentenced to 180 days in jail after a trial earlier this year. A 10-year prison sentence was suspended.

The NFL says Brent will be suspended for the first 10 games of the season for his intoxication manslaughter conviction in the 2012 death of teammate Jerry Brown. Brent also can&#39;t be involved in team activities for the first six weeks and must avoid any &quot;adverse involvement with law enforcement.&quot;
