After losing LeBron James and reconstructing the team to compete, the core of the team has turned over. Until now, what hadn&rsquo;t&nbsp;changed was the front office and coaching staff.  Still leading the charge for the Heat are Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra. Spoelstra has been the beficiary of some great assistant coaches over the years. But prominent assistant coaches Ron Rothstein and Bob McAdoo will no longer play significant roles on the Heat&rsquo;s bench, according to Yahoo Sports&rsquo; Adrian Wojnarowski. According to Woj, the moves will make room for Juwan Howard to be promoted from his role in player development. Rothstein and McAdoo are expected to remain with the Heat, but it is not yet known in what capacity. It is immediately unclear what role Rothstein and McAdoo will have in the organization, but both are expected to continue to have jobs with the Heat, league sources said. Heat president Pat Riley and Spoelstra have long professional and personal ties with both men. Rothstein was the franchise&rsquo;s first head coach in 1988, where he remained for three seasons. He returned to the organization&nbsp;in 2000 to coach Miami&rsquo;s WNBA team. He&rsquo;s worked under&nbsp;Heat coaches Riley, Stan Van Gundy and Spoelstra for the past ten years. Hall-of-Fame player McAdoo knows Riley from their time with the Los Angles Lakers and has been with the Heat for 18 years. David Fizdale, who has been rumored for head coaching jobs recently, will remain the team&rsquo;s top assistant coach.
