Cooper-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Boston Celtics&rsquo; point guard Rajon Rondo returned from an ACL injury and played in 30 games during the 2013-2014 season. Now as he continues to try to prove he is healthy, he reportedly wants the Celtics to trade him. However, that may not be very easy.  A. Sherrod Blakely of CSN New England explains why teams may be hesitant to deal for Rondo.  And that deal is nowhere close to materializing, in large part because teams want to see Rondo play without limitations. He returned to play in 30 games last season following a torn ACL injury in 2013, but he was just a shell of the player he was prior to the injury. Teams, including the Celtics, want to see how he handles back-to-back games, which he didn&rsquo;t play in at all last season. Can he carry over the strides he made last season in shooting the ball? Defensively, he was beat off the dribble far too often last season. Was that rust from the long lay-off, or is he starting to lose a step or two with time or because of the injury? These are just some of the questions that only Rondo&rsquo;s play can truly answer.  Last season, Rondo averaged 11.7 points, 9.8 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 40.3% from the field, 28.9% from beyond the arc and 62.7% from the free throw line. Rondo&nbsp;was originally&nbsp;selected by the Celtics with the 21st-overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft. In his eight-year career, he has averaged&nbsp;11.1 points, 8.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.9 steals per game while shooting 47.5% from the floor, 25.2% from three and 62.1% from the free throw line.
