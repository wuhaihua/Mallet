Colts' Irsay receives year or probation Colts' Irsay receives year or probation Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay will spend one year on probation after pleading guilty to driving under the influence of prescription drugs.During a change of plea hearing held this morning at the Hamilton County (Ind.) courthouse, Irsay officially entered a guilty plea for one misdemeanor charge of impaired driving stemming from his arrest by Carmel police on March 16.He previously pleaded not guilty to two counts of the offense.A toxicology report in court showed Irsay had the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone" in his system during his arrest. Police records said officers "continuously had to support Irsay in order to prevent him from falling over."During his probation, Irsay will be regularly drug tested. Judge J. Richard Campbell ordered that if Irsay is arrested again for operating while intoxicated within the next five year, the charge will be a felony offense.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has yet to rule on any discipline for Irsay based on the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy. The case is being watched closely by players who want to see whether the commissioner treats an owner the same as players in disciplinary matters.Irsay may have to appear in court in an unrelated case involving custody of two minor children who live with their mother in a million-dollar home Irsay bought earlier this year.An attorneys conference in that case had been scheduled for Sept. 2 but has been continued. Morgan Superior Court Judge G. Thomas Gray has already ruled against an attempt to kill the subpoena requiring Irsay to testify.The Martinsville custody case centers on Greg Martin's concern about the well-being of his minor children, ages 17 and 12, when they are in Irsay's presence.In a letter to the court, Martin stated that his children were in the home of his ex-wife, Jami Martin, on the night of Irsay's arrest. The home is a few blocks from where he was arrested by Carmel police.
