He ran for five yards and first down in the middle of the second quarter from his own 11-yard line when he was horse collar tackled and Louisville was given a 15-yard penalty. Duke Johnson&rsquo;s mom was visibly not happy about the tackle, pointing and yelling for the first down. Duke Johnson rushed for 920 yards and six touchdowns last season for the Hurricanes before he broke is ankle and looks to improve this season as one of the nation&rsquo;s top running backs with his undeniable speed.  In 2012, Johnson&rsquo;s freshman season, he played in all 12 games at tailback and kick returner, making five starts and rushing for a UM freshman-record 947 yards and 10 touchdowns. Named the ACC Rookie of the Year, the freshman All-American was the nation&rsquo;s No.&nbsp;2 kick returner and set a UM single-season record with 892 kick-return yards and two touchdowns. His 2,060 all-purpose yards were second-most in program history behind Willis McGahee&rsquo;s 2,108 in 2002. Johnson&nbsp;was on his way to demolishing&nbsp;the 1,000-yard mark in 2013, but then&nbsp;got injured in the eighth game of the year at Florida State.&nbsp;Going into that game, Johnson ranked third in the nation in all-purpose yards with over 182 per game, 10th in kickoff returns with just under a 30 yard average, 11th in rushing yards per game with 117.6 yards and 20th in total rushing yards. Now in his junior season, Johnson looks to compete with running backs like Georgia&rsquo;s Todd Gurley, Nebraska&rsquo;s Ameer Abdullah and South Carolina&rsquo;s Mike Davis for the elite running back in college football.
