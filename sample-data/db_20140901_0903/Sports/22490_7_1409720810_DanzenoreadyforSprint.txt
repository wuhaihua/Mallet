If it was soft ground I wouldn't be running him," said Appleby."Hopefully it will be good ground for Saturday which would be ideal."He's in good order. We haven't got many opportunities for him so I thought we might as well have a bash at it and see how good he is."Danzeno has only had five career starts but has already shown himself to be a smart sort, winning the Group Three Chipchase Stakes at Newcastle on his latest outing in June to give connections dreams of picking up a Group One.
