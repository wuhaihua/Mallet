Irvin: Will be 'long night' for Linsley Irvin: Will be 'long night' for Linsley 

                                        
                                        
                                    
                            
                        
                                 Corey Linsley will be starting at center for the         Green Bay Packers Thursday night in the loudest stadium in the NFL, CenturyLink Field, without having had a single snap with quarterback         Aaron Rodgers in preseason play.

Seattle Seahawks linebacker         Bruce Irvin can't help but feel sorry for him.





     

"I'm going to pray for him," Irvin told reporters Tuesday. "It's going to be a long night, man. We've got to just take advantage of it."

The Packers' starter at center,         JC Tretter, sustained a fracture to his left knee during the Packers' Aug. 22 preseason game against the         Oakland Raiders.Â Tretter's agent, Alan Herman, told ESPN.com's Rob Demovsky that he expects the Packers to place him on short-term injured reserve.

Besides dealing with the noise, Linsley will be tasked with trying to stop         Brandon Mebane, one of the best nose tackles in the NFL who anchors the defensive line for the defending Super Bowl champions, who boasted the NFL's best defense last season.

"All the weaknesses that [Linsley] shows us, we've got to expose it," Irvin told reporters. "Hopefully, 'Bane going to do what I know he's going to do to him. So, we've just got to be ready."

Irvin is on the Seahawks' active roster despite not participating in training camp as he recovered from hip surgery. He said he'll be playing Thursday.

"Oh yeah. I ain't supposed to say this, but yeah, I'll be out there Thursday," he said.

The Packers plan to use their no-huddle offense extensively against Seattle, having spent the offseason and training camp working on it. But during the preseason finale against Kansas City with Linsley at center, they ran by unofficial count only three snaps of no-huddle with Linsley on the field. Not only will Rodgers not have had a single in-game snap with Linsley before, but they will never have operated in the no-huddle together, either.

"Corey's a smart guy. He's played a lot of center in his time and he's going to be expected to play well. So we expect him to be able to keep up,'' Rodgers said Tuesday. "I've said it a lot, but he's got two incredible guards on both sides of him who are going to help him out with the calls and make sure that he's ready. But Corey is going to study hard, he's very well-coached and he's going to be ready to go.''
