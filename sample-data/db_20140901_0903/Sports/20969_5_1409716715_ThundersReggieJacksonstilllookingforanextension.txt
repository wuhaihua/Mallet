Thunder defeated the Grizzlies 92-89. Mandatory Credit: Nelson Chenault-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Oklahoma City Thunder reserve guard Reggie Jackson has been a solid bench player throughout his career. However, in the postseason, he helped the Thunder avoid a first round upset at the hands of the Memphis Grizzlies and was inserted into the starting lineup. He clearly proved his worth and will soon be looking to cash in with a contract extension.  &ldquo;I hope to get things done,&rdquo; Jackson told Darnell Mayberry of The Oklahomanem. &ldquo;But if not, it is what it is. I can&rsquo;t really dwell on it. I have to go out there and compete. That&rsquo;s where I am. I have to go out there and enjoy the game and trust that my representation and us sitting down and figuring things out is hopefully going to lead to us getting something done before the deadline.&rdquo; Jackson knows getting a deal done could be difficult. &ldquo;[It will take] communication,&rdquo; Jackson explained. &ldquo;We have to figure out things that we can do on both ends. What we envision for the organization from both ends. I&rsquo;d like to play a certain way. When it&rsquo;s all said and done and I hang up my jersey, hang up my shoes, I have many goals that I want to accomplish. So I think it&rsquo;s going to be about what&rsquo;s the vision for obtaining those goals from both parts and what&rsquo;s the vision that we have moving forward&hellip; I would love to get a deal done, but if that&rsquo;s not what happens, that&rsquo;s not what happens. I can&rsquo;t necessarily dwell on it and think about that too much. I have to go out there and compete.&rdquo; Jackson averaged 13.1 points, 4.1 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game while shooting 44.0% from the field, 33.9% from three and 89.3% from the free throw line during the regular season. He put up 11.1 points, 3.8 assists and 2.4 rebounds per game while shooting 46.6% from the floor, 39.6% from beyond the arc and 88.6% from the charity stripe&nbsp;in the postseason.
