			Exeter Chiefs coach Rob Baxter has revealed scrum-half Pat Phibbs is back with the club on a trial basis.The Australian played 10 times for the club in his previous spell but was released by London Irish over the summer after breaking his foot in pre-season last year.Exeter are short on options at No 9 with Dave Lewis and Will Chudley suffering injuries in pre-season and Baxter will give Phibbs a run-out when the Exeter Braves kick-off their A League campaign next Monday at Saracens."Pat's down on trial with us," said Baxter."Obviously he hasn't played for a while with the injury issue he had last year, so he's coming down and is training with us this week then we'll make a decision on the length of time he stays with us."It's a bit difficult for Pat because he's not been on the rugby pitch in a competitive sense for a while so we'll have a look at him and see how up to speed he is."With Dave Lewis having a relatively short-term injury, whoever we bring in has got to be up to speed pretty quickly."It's an opportunity for Pat to get back on a rugby pitch and do some training and play some rugby, so we'll have to see how he gets on."We'll probably involve him in Monday night's A game if he comes through training okay then we'll make a decision based on that.”
