Trabzonspor had to settle for a goalless draw at Erciyesspor, while Sivasspor suffered an early setback when losing 2-1 at home to Gaziantepspor, with Muhammet Demir bagging a brace after John Utaka had put the hosts ahead.
Eskisehirspor were another team to come from behind and claim victory when edging out Konyaspor, with Hurriyet Gucer equalising Gabriel Torje's early strike before Erkan Zengin netted the winner from the penalty spot on 76 minutes.
Istanbul Buyuksehir held on for a 1-1 draw against Kasimpasa after having Rajko Rotman sent off. Rizespor and Genclerbirligi also shared the spoils after Umit Korkmaz netted for the hosts following Guido Kocer's opener, while Akhisar Belediye won 2-1 at Balikesirspor thanks to goals from Saidi Ntibazonkiza and Mehmet Akyuz.
