The         Oakland Athletics have acquired slugger         Adam Dunn in a trade with the         Chicago White Sox.

The Athletics announced the trade Sunday on their official Twitter account, saying that the White Sox received minor league pitcher Nolan Sanburn in exchange for Dunn and unspecified cash considerations.

     

Oakland will pay approximately half of the remaining $2.5 million owed to Dunn this season, sources told ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney.

The 34-year-old Dunn, who has 460 career home runs, is in the last year of a four-year, $56 million deal. He is batting .220 with 20 homers, 54 RBIs and a .340 on-base percentage this season.

Because of a no-trade clause, Dunn had to approve the move to Oakland, a team with great need right now.

The Athletics lead the majors in runs scored, but rank only 20th in runs in August, following the trade of         Yoenis Cespedes for         Jon Lester on July 31.

The White Sox also had conversations Sunday with the         Los Angeles Dodgers about Dunn, according to sources.

In order for a player to be eligible for a postseason roster, he must be a member of the playoff team by Aug. 31, which is why the Athletics needed to Dunn on Sunday in order to have him available for the postseason.
