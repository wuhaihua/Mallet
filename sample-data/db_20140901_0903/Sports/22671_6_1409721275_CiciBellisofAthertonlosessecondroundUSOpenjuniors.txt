Cici Bellis of Atherton loses second round US Open juniors Cici Bellis of Atherton loses second round US Open juniors  NEW YORK Â -- The second round once again proved the downfall for U.S. Open darling CiCi Bellis.
The 15-year-old from Atherton, who became an overnight sensation when she stunned 12th-seeded Dominika Cibulkova in Flushing Meadows' first round, lost her juniors match Tuesday to 17-year-old Russian Natalia Vikhlyantseva 7-6 (9), 2-6, 6-1.
Bellis, the top-seeded girl, frequently shrieked at herself after bad shots, at times saying, "Where's your game?" and "That is so lame!"

It was Bellis' second straight match played on the Grandstand, the third-largest venue, to accommodate her newfound following.
After beating Cibulkova, the Australian Open runner-up, in the main draw to become the youngest player to win a U.S. Open match since 1996, she lost in three sets to Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan.
