Panthers remain 'confident' Cam Newton will start Week 1 Panthers remain 'confident' Cam Newton will start Week 1 Aug 17, 2014; Charlotte, NC, USA; Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (1) looks to pass the ball during the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs at Bank of America Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Carolina Panthers star quarterback Cam Newton suffered a hairline fracture in his ribs during the team&rsquo;s third preseason game, but all signs point to the Auburn product being ready to go for Week 1.  Newton&nbsp;told ESPN last Wednesday that &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind&rdquo; in regards to his Week 1 starting status and coach Ron Rivera echoed similar sentiments during the&nbsp;week. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t appear as if anything has changed. Rivera has reiterated his confidence about Newton&rsquo;s status versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Rivera: I am still confident Cam will start vs. Tampa Bay. &mdash; Steve Reed (@SteveReedAP) September 1, 2014 This is obviously great news for the Panthers that Newton seems to basically be a lock to start the opener. Carolina lost multiple offensive weapons this offseason, so losing Newton for any period of time would be a disaster. Newton practiced on Monday and did so wearing a bigger flak jacket in order to better protect his ribs, according to Bill Voth of&nbsp;Black and Blue Review.&nbsp;  &ldquo;I told him in the event of a water landing he can be used as a flotation device,&rdquo; center Ryan Kalil joked. (&hellip;) In the portion of practice open to the media, the fourth-year player&nbsp;still appeared a bit stiff, but&nbsp;he did go through drills seemingly without restrictions.  It certainly seems like Newton has progressed significantly since the he injury suffered on Aug. 22. Newton threw for 3,379 yards, 24 touchdowns and 13 interceptions this past season.
