                    There&#39;s a lot of danger during a NASCAR race. Sometimes, that danger manifests itself in the form of unexpected obstacles on the track.


During Sunday night&#39;s race in Atlanta, Kevin Harvick radioed his crew to tell them he thought he had almost hit a cat on the track.


I just re-listened and Harvick did say a cat just ran in front of him. #nascar

Replay video from ESPN showed a small, dark animal jet in front of Harvick&#39;s car, running from the embankment into the center of the field.

The animal was quickly identified as a squirrel, who was hunkering down in Turn 3.
