"I have to admit, even when we were up in the box watching our big-league team play, we had the Jackie Robinson team on our TV," Epstein said at the parade and rally last week. "Our players were sneaking in after batting practice to see what they could. We had a rain delay during the final and our players watched every pitch and they were going crazy like little leaguers themselves when they turned that double play to end it."
And now, as the Cubs return home to host the Milwaukee Brewers, they're celebrating JRW by wearing their jerseys (which will later be auctioned for charity) and invited the team to tour the ballpark and hang out with the players.

The JRW team will also be throwing out the first pitch of today's game and will sing during the seventh-inning stretch.
