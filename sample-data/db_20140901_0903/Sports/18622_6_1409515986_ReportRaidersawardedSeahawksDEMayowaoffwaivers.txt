Benson, 23, was undrafted out of Idaho in 2013 before signing with Seattle.
The 6-foot-3, 252-pound pass rusher appeared in two games for the Seahawks last season, notching a pair of tackles. 
Benson played defensive end in Dan Quinn's 4-3 scheme, similar to the Raiders' system under Jason Tarver. 
He joins a talented group position that features Justin Tuck and LaMarr Woodley.
