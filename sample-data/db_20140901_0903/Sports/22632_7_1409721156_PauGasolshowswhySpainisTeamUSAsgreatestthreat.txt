    Spain is the greatest threat to Team USA in the FIBA Basketball World Cup, and the Gasol brothers showed why as they led the way in a 82-63 win over Brazil.


    Pau Gasol, the newest Chicago Bull, was the most impressive player on the floor, even with NBA big men trying to defend him. Gasol terrorized Anderson Verejao and Nene, posting 26 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks.


    Spain easily defeated Brazil in their Group A matchup, and you can watch Gasol's impressive performance below.
