                    USC quarterback Cody Kessler was hospitalized with a staph infection in his toe, according to Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News.

Kessler was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for his 394-yard, four-TD performance in the Trojans&rsquo; rout of Fresno State on Saturday.

USC said Kessler had a procedure on his toe, but not provide details.



Kessler did not practice Tuesday, but he said that he was not concerned about his status for Saturday&rsquo;s game at Stanford. Coach Steve Sarkisian said he expected Kessler to practice Wednesday, according to Wolf.

According to the Mayo Clinic, staph infections usually cause minor skin infections but &ldquo;can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart.&rdquo;
