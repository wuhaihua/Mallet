                    Who is this year&#39;s out-of-nowhere Heisman Trophy candidate?&nbsp;

Sorry, Texas A&amp;M&#39;s Kenny Hill is already taken. Keep an eye on Arizona freshman Anu Solomon, who didn&#39;t take long to put up numbers in Rich Rodriguez&#39;s offense.&nbsp;

Solomon, who totaled 425 passing yards and 50 rushing yards in a 58-13 win against UNLV, is yet another dual-threat quarterback poised to put up big numbers. While most of the attention is on Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota and now Hill.&nbsp;

Solomon was one of seven quarterbacks to finish with at least 250 yards passing and 50 yards rushing in Week 1. Others included BYU&#39;s Taysom Hill (308 pass, 97 rush), Georgia Tech&#39;s Justin Thomas (282 pass, 71 rush), Nevada&#39;s Cody Fajardo (303 pass, 68 rush), Nebraska&#39;s Tommy Armstrong Jr. (271 pass, 62 rush), UNLV&#39;s Blake Decker (256 pass, 56 rush) and Texas State&#39;s Tyler Jones (278 pass, 51 rush).

Hill and Armstrong also are names to keep tabs on, but Solomon and Rodriguez are a match made for big numbers. Rodriguez&#39;s success with Pat White, Denard Robinson and Shaun King is well-documented, but none of those quarterbacks ever had a 400-yard passing game in college. There&#39;s reason to be excited about Solomon.&nbsp;
