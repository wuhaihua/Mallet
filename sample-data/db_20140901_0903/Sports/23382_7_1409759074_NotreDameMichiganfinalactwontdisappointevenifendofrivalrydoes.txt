                    Some Midwesterners claim they can smell football season.

It hits a few hours after dawn on a September Saturday, when a blinding sun slams into that first fall breeze, and the body doesn&rsquo;t quite know if it&rsquo;s warm or cold. Nostrils flare.

That&rsquo;s about the time to head inside and watch Michigan and Notre Dame. It&rsquo;s marked the unofficial official start to big-time college football games.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Both sides can say what they want now. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told Michigan AD David Brandon back in 2012 that the rivalry was off. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what Brian Kelly and Brady Hoke say, either. It&#39;s an injustice to end an annual rite of passage and makes you wonder, &ldquo;Does tradition exist anymore?&rdquo;

&quot;Being around it so long, watching these rivalry games as kids then growing up there was always that excitement for the big games,&quot; Hoke said on the Big Ten teleconference Tuesday. &quot;As you know now, you&#39;ve got football on all day in every market. When you lose some of these games; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s best for college football.&quot;

Notre Dame and Michigan have a reputation as living-in-the-past programs, when this game was the nonconference game throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The game, however, continues to produce dramatic finishes to the present day. Since the programs resumed the rivalry on an almost-annual basis in 1978, the Wolverines have a 15-14-1 advantage. Four of the last five meetings have been decided by a TD or less, and close to 20 points per game were scored in the fourth quarter in those games.

Schembechler. Holtz. &ldquo;The Rocket.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Catch.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shoelaces flappin&rsquo; in the wind.&rdquo;

&quot;It&#39;s one of those games, Coach Schembechler used to say, &#39;That&#39;s a measuring point for where we&#39;re at,&#39; &quot; Hoke said. &quot;That&#39;s what the Notre Dame game is.&quot;

It&#39;s a shame that this is the last season for an early-season temperature check for both teams, especially in the first year of the College Football Playoff.



The Irish&rsquo;s see-though excuses for leaving are flimsy at best. Don&rsquo;t hide behind the five-game ACC schedule or the other longer-running &ldquo;rivalries&rdquo; with Michigan State and Purdue. Notre Dame is 27-9 against Purdue since 1978. Moving to Lucas Oil Stadium doesn&rsquo;t sugarcoat that cupcake.&nbsp;

On the other end, Michigan fans will have to wait until 2017 for a true marquee nonconference game when they face Florida in JerryWorld. No longer can a Wolverines fan tell a Michigan State fan they are behind Notre Dame on the rivalry pecking order. That&#39;s simply not the case.

Shame is these schools just figured out that playing at night &mdash; the case the last three years &mdash; is the way to go. Last year&rsquo;s Michigan-Notre Dame game drew a 5.3 rating and was the fifth-most watched regular-season game.&nbsp; That was up from a 4.0 the previous season.

Fortunately, the last primetime installment is shaping up to be the best of the last four years. Both the Irish and Wolverines averaged more than 10.0 yards per play in their season-opening wins.

Everett Golson had five total TDs for Notre Dame last week, and Devin Gardner looks like the guy who torched the Irish for 376 total yards and five TDs last season. Either Golson or Gardner likely will receive that all-too familiar September Heisman push as a result.&nbsp;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I get into all of the hype of the game and things like that,&quot; Golson said. &quot;But at the same time, you have to take care of business and you have to prepare. Michigan&#39;s got a great football team. It&#39;s going to be a tough one, but I&#39;m ready for it.&quot;

The last time the Irish beat the Wolverines in South Bend they used that momentum all the way to a BCS championship game. Back in 2006, the Wolverines plastered No. 2 Notre Dame 47-21 in South Bend and rode that momentum to a 1-2 showdown with the Buckeyes. Those games aren&rsquo;t quite as far back as the naysayers want you to believe.

That should lead to a hell of a final act. Either The Victors of the Victory March will echo in South Bend on Saturday night, but the fact is nobody really leaves a winner.&nbsp;

And any Midwesterner with a keen sense of smell will tell you the same thing.&nbsp;
