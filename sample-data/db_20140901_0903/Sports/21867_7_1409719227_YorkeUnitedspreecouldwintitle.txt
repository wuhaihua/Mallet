			Radamel Falcao can fire Manchester United to the Premier League title this season, says Dwight Yorke.New boss Louis van Gaal has endured a tough start to life in charge at Old Trafford and has failed to win a competitive match in four attempts, losing 4-0 in the Capital One Cup at MK Dons and picking up just two points from the first three Premier League games.However, following the arrival of British-record signing Angel di Maria last week and the Deadline Day captures of striker Falcao and defender Daley Blind, Yorke believes United now have a squad capable of winning the title.“With the team the manager is building, I believe it is good enough to go and win the Premier League,” the former United striker told Sky Sports News HQ.“They are playing catch-up at this moment and they need to start getting results now, but if they can do that the confidence will generate and when that builds up you’ve seen what they’ve done in the past. There is no doubt in my mind Manchester United could go on to win the league from here.“I know a lot of people will be questioning that, saying the new players need time to bed in, but these players are world-class players, not just players trying to fit into the football club. These players are that good that it’s easy to fit into the system of Van Gaal.“The players Man United now have at their disposal will send alarm bells ringing in the Premier League.”Statement As a former United hitman, Yorke is perfectly placed to judge the talents of Colombia ace Falcao – and he reckons the forward, who has joined on a season-long loan deal from Monaco, will provide the goals to fire the club back to the top of English football.While there are question marks about what Falcao’s arrival means for current front men Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, Yorke feels the trio can work together, with the latter pair creating opportunities for ‘the best goalscorer in the world’.“Falcao is a number nine, the ultimate number nine,” he said. “You look at his goalscoring record and he’s a phenomenal striker. He’s not interested in link-up play, he just knows how to hit the back of the net. He’s the best goalscorer in the world right now.“Of course we’ve got Rooney and Van Persie at the club, but these players could drop in behind or play left or right of him. I don’t see that being a problem. These players are all tremendous players.“You look at the likes of Barcelona and what they have in Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar, it’s a similar formation Van Gaal and the players will adapt to.“It’s a big statement, too. United haven’t got Champions League football and there are a lot of doubts in terms of the way the club is going but we haven’t just seen one marquee player, we’ve seen two significant signings in Di Maria and now Falcao.“It’s a statement of intent that the club is trying to get back to the top – and there’s no doubt in my mind Man United is on the way back up.”Watch Falcao's debut for Man Utd v QPR live on Sky Sports 1 from 3.30pm, Sunday September 14.
