Mandatory Credit: Dave Weaver-USA Today SportsMLB    There was some discussion&nbsp; a few weeks back that the Chicago White Sox could be tempted to recall left-hander Carlos Rodon, their first-round pick in June&rsquo;s draft, but general manager Rick Hahn told the Chicago Sun-Times Tuesday that won&rsquo;t happen. Per Daryl Van Schouwen of the Sun-Times, via Twitter: Hahn on Rodon: &ldquo;It just wasn&rsquo;t right time in his development to bring him to the big leagues and and ask him to get big league hitters out&rdquo; &mdash; Daryl Van Schouwen (@CST_soxvan) September 2, 2014 Rodon rocketed through the White Sox&rsquo; farm system this summer after signing with Chicago after he was taken third overall in June.  Rodon made a start and a relief appearance for the White Sox Rookie-level affiliate in the Arizona League, pitching three innings and allowing two runs on four hits with five strikeouts. In two starts and two relief appearances with High-A Winston-Salem, Rodon worked 9.2 innings and surrendered three runs, two earned, on seven hits with five walks and 15 strikeouts. He made three starts for Triple-A Charlotte, working 12 innings and allowing four runs on nine hits, walking eight and fanning 18. Rodon&rsquo;s last start at Charlotte was Saturday, when he worked five innings and took a no-decision against Atlanta&rsquo;s top farm club in Gwinnett, throwing 81 pitches. Rodon started 14 games for North Carolina State this spring, going 6-7 with a 2.01 ERA in 98.2 innings, striking out 117.
