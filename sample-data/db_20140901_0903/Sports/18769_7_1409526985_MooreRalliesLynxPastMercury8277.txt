MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Maya Moore scored 13 of her 32 points in the fourth quarter and the Minnesota Lynx avoided elimination by beating the Phoenix Mercury 82-77 in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals on Sunday.
Diana Taurasi scored 23 for the Mercury, who will host Game 3 on Tuesday night. The Lynx are three-time defending Western Conference champions.
Tied at 75 with 23.3 seconds left, Seimone Augustus hit a 15-foot jumper and was fouled by DeWanna Bonner. Augustus, who finished with 23 points, converted the three-point play, and after Candice Dupree missed a 15-footer on the other end, Moore hit two free throws to put it out of reach for Minnesota.
The Lynx went on a 13-0 run early in the fourth quarter to take their first lead since they scored the first point of the game. Augustus scored off a feed from Moore to put Minnesota on top 66-65 with 6:19 to play.
