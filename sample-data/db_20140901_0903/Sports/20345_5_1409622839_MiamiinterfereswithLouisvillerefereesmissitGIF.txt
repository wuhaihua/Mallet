Scott (27) during the first quarter of play at Papa JohnNCAA Football    The first week of college football, which has bee excellent, will come to an end on Monday night.  The Louisville Cardinals are playing host to the Miami Hurricanes in their first ever game in the ACC. The Cardinals got off to a nice start, using &nbsp;a 12-play, 93-yard drive capped by a two-yard touchdown pass from Will Gardner to Charles Standberry at the 6:39 mark in the first quarter. The Hurricanes, however, answered with a six-play, 38-yard touchdown drive. Freshman quarterback Brad Kaaya his tight Chase Walford for the score. Although the game was tied, it has been very sloppy and the officials have been just as bad as the players. On one particular play, they missed a very obvious pass interference call. You can see for yourself just how bad the no call was below.  &nbsp; Stay tuned to FanSided as we keep you up to date with the latest news throughout the first weekend of College Football, which comes to an end Monday night, and throughout the rest of the season.&nbsp;The pros will start their regular season on Thursday night when the world champion Seattle Seahawks host the Green Bay Packers and we&rsquo;ll have everything you need to know about the NFL as well.
