			Hull KR have agreed to release full-back Greg Eden from the final year of his contract to enable him to move to Australia.The 23-year-old, who was dubbed England's Billy Slater by Nathan Brown two years ago during their time together at Huddersfield, is thought to have secured a contract with Brisbane Broncos.The Castleford-born player has made 37 appearances for the Robins since joining them from the Giants two years ago."I've really enjoyed my time at Hull KR and I wish everybody here all the best for the future," said Eden, who had loan spell at Salford earlier this season after losing the full-back spot to Ben Cockayne."It's a great club and I'm sure good things are around the corner under Chris Chester but I didn't feel personally that I could turn this opportunity down.Ambition"I've always had an ambition to play in the NRL and it's a great chance for me to go over there and hopefully improve my game."Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith said: "We have retained an option on Greg's services should he return to Super League but he makes the move to the NRL with our best wishes."We have been planning for his departure as we look to strengthen our squad for 2015 and have already recruited heavily in the outside backs for next season."I'd like to thank Greg for his service to Hull KR over the past two years and wish him good luck with his new club."
