			Clive Cox has been delighted by the progress Kodi Bear has made since his impressive win at Ascot in July.The Dubai Dewhurst Stakes is the plan for the son of Kodiac, who finished a close fifth on his second start in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot.That form has been given several boosts, not least by the winner, The Wow Signal, who followed up in the Prix Morny at Deauville, while Charlie Hills' Muhaarar, behind Kodi Bear at Ascot, won the Gimcrack."The plan is still very much the Dewhurst," said Cox."I've been very happy with him at home and it was nice to see the form work out in the Gimcrack the other week."At this stage everything is going as well as we could hope."He's growing and maturing all the time and I'm hoping that being patient with him will pay off."I'm viewing him as very much a three-year-old type."
