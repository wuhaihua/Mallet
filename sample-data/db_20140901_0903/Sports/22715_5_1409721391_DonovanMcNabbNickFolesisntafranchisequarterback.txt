Donovan McNabb: Nick Foles isn't a franchise quarterback Donovan McNabb: Nick Foles isn't a franchise quarterback Aug 28, 2014; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) on the sidelines during game against the New York Jets at Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles defeated the Jets, 37-7. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Ever since the Eagles let Donovan McNabb go, the former NFL quarterback has been salty. So it comes as little surprise that he doesn&rsquo;t think much of the Eagles&rsquo; current starter Nick Foles.  McNabb was recently asked if he thought Foles was a franchise quarterback, and he had not trouble responding. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that, but if I had to give a take, I would say no,&rdquo; McNabb told the 97.5 The Fanatic, via ESPN. &ldquo;I think what he will do, he won&rsquo;t do what he did last year, that just won&rsquo;t happen. I see him being maybe a 25-touchdown, 8 to 10 interception guy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s odd that he says he &ldquo;can&rsquo;t answer it,&rdquo; then goes on and answers it. But Foles responded appropriately. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s entitled to their opinion,&rdquo; Foles said after practicing on Tuesday. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t earned anything yet. Like I said, it&rsquo;s a week-to-week thing. It always will be. My job&rsquo;s to go out there and play to the best of my ability. I haven&rsquo;t earned anything yet. Maybe when I&rsquo;m done with football totally, I&rsquo;ll look back and see something, but no.&rdquo; Foles had to win over two different coaches to get his starts.&nbsp;He lost the job early in the Andy Reid regime, but eventually got six starts. He lost it again during the Kelly regime, but again, won the job. &ldquo;I just had an opportunity to go out there and play,&rdquo; Foles said. &ldquo;My teammates stood beside me. Mike was tremendous throughout everything. That helped me a lot when I prepared and went into a game.
