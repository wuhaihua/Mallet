                    HAMPTON, Ga. &mdash; Kevin Harvick is pretty used to having a great car and not winning races.

But even the events Sunday night at Atlanta Motor Speedway were ones he couldn&rsquo;t have predicted although the result was the same: Harvick had a dominant car but didn&#39;t go to victory lane.



Harvick led 195 of 335 laps in the Oral-B 500 but finished 19th, the last driver on the lead lap, after a wreck on the first attempt at a green-white-checkered finish.

Harvick, restarting fourth, had four fresh tires while the front row of Matt Kenseth and Paul Menard had just two. Denny Hamlin, who restarted next to Harvick, was on four new tires.

On the restart, Harvick ran into the back of the slower Menard and when they made contact again, it forced Harvick into the wall, damaging the side of his car.

&ldquo;You knew the 27 (of Menard) and the 20 (of Kenseth) weren&rsquo;t going to go and I tried to time it to where I could get on the outside of him, and he kept coming up and the 22 (of Joey Logano) was still on our outside,&rdquo; Harvick said.

&ldquo;It just got crazy there at the end. The 27, we all probably could have given each other more room. We just wrecked.&rdquo;

Harvick has led more than 1,000 laps this year but has just two wins.

&ldquo;You just have to ride through it,&rdquo; Harvick said. &ldquo;You do the best that you can. You can&rsquo;t control the circumstances like tonight. It&rsquo;s just unfortunate for everybody &hellip; that everything went the way it did.

&ldquo;But what do you do?&rdquo;

The one thing Harvick&#39;s Stewart-Haas Racing team still needs to do is get better on pit road. The Joe Gibbs Racing teams seemed to rule the night on pit road, and Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers told Harvick during the race that JGR might have made some development gains with their air guns.

&ldquo;We lost control (of the race) every time we came to pit road tonight,&rdquo; Harvick said. &ldquo;So I thought we had that better, but we got just absolutely murdered on pit road every time we came down by the 11 (of Hamlin) and the 20 (of Kenseth).

&ldquo;Those guys are obviously doing a good job and we have known that all year and need to fix it.&rdquo;

At least one thing went Harvick&rsquo;s way: He didn&rsquo;t hit what he thought was a cat that ran across the track during the opening laps of the race. It more likely was a squirrel.

&ldquo;That was a cat,&rdquo; Harvick said. &ldquo;A cat ran across the backstretch. It would have made a big mess.&rdquo;
