								Love supplemented for Haydock
							
						
					
				
			
			Clive Cox has supplemented the consistent Es Que Love for Saturday's Betfred Sprint Cup at Haydock.Winner of the Lennox Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, Cox has been encouraged to make the move, at a cost of Â£15,600, by the dry weather forecast for Merseyside this week."He's in great form and we're playing with the Goodwood winnings, so it seemed a sensible thing to do," said Cox."His last piece of work was super and it is forecast to be dry for the rest of the week."If that's right and it gets warmer this week, then I hope very much that the ground will be in his favour."He could have run in the Park Stakes at Doncaster over seven furlongs, but he would have had a 4lb penalty so that was another factor to sway us."We gave it lots of thought and when you think Sole Power has yet to win over six, it gives the race an open look."Es Que Love is one of 25 possibles for the Group One, including last year's winner Gordon Lord Byron.
