                    Bill Belichick all but rolled his eyes upon hearing of tight end Rob Gronkowski&rsquo;s declaration to the media that he&rsquo;s ready to play Sunday.

&ldquo;With all due respect to Rob, I&rsquo;m glad he feels the way he does, but in the end, we&rsquo;ll have to make the decision that we feel is best for the team and we&rsquo;ll do that as we go through the week.&rdquo;



Gronk may have gotten ahead of himself, but it was not a mistake. He spoke about the excitement of his post-surgery debut to beat reporters to all of the inevitable questions. The problem is that he overstepped a coach who keeps tight reins on things in New England.&nbsp;

Belichick said he was glad that Gronkowski was &ldquo;optimistic,&rdquo; but made it clear that it&rsquo;s not his decision.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an honor to be back out there with my teammates,&rdquo; Gronkowski said on Monday. &ldquo;Super pumped, super excited and just preparing for the game. It just feels good in my mind to know that I&rsquo;ll be out there with my boys, working hard, grinding with them, being out there.&rdquo;

Gronkowski is coming off knee surgery that ended his 2013 season. He tore both his ACL and MCL. He said he is mentally and physically ready for the season. Last year this time, he was also sidelined as he recovered from arm and back surgery.

&ldquo;Whatever we can or are available to use him to do &mdash; however big, small, whatever the decision is at the end of the week &mdash; and he&rsquo;ll be ready to do it,&rdquo; said Pats&rsquo; offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.&nbsp;
