Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsMLB    Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angles bounced the Oakland Athletics Sunday to take a five game lead in the AL West. Mike Trout hit his career-high 31st home run and had three RBI&rsquo;s in the Angels 8-1 victory.  Angels pitcher Matt Shoemaker&nbsp;pitched seven shutout innings and allowed just five hits Sunday. The win is Shoemaker&rsquo;s 14th of the season as he moves on to 14-4 with a 3.14 ERA for the Angels who haven&rsquo;t missed a beat since losing Garrett Richards for the season. The Angels compeled a four game sweep over divison rival, Oakland. Oakland&rsquo;s road record has now moved to an even 35-35 and has lost 14 of their last 20&nbsp;moving them to being five games behind the streaking Angels. The Angels won their sixth in row and own the best record in the majors at 83-53. They shut out the A&rsquo;s for the 29 consecutive innings while opening a five-game lead atop the AL West heading into September. Scott Kazmir got just four outs for Oakland. He was pulled in the second inning after giving up six earned runs on two hits and 6 walks. &nbsp; Oakland is 12-17 since trading away outfield superstar Yoenis Cespedes to the Boston Red Sox for Jon Lester. The A&rsquo;s did not have a good weekend but acquired Adam Dunn from the Chicago White Sox&nbsp;in a trade Sunday to help their slumping offense. Oakland, which led the AL West for nearly four straight months this season, now faces its biggest division deficit since May 25, 2013. &nbsp;
