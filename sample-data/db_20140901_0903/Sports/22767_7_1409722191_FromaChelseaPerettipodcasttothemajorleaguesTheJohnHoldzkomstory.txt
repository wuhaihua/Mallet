From a Chelsea Peretti podcast to the major leagues: The John Holdzkom story From a Chelsea Peretti podcast to the major leagues: The John Holdzkom story 
           
                    ST. LOUIS&mdash;Pittsburgh rookie John Holdzkom made his major-league debut Tuesday night, a little more than a year-and-a-half after he made his debut on comedian Chelsea Peretti&rsquo;s podcast.&nbsp;

Yep, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;

As Holdzkom, a 6-foot-7 right-hander who turns 27 in October, was in the midst of striking out the side against the Cardinals in his first major-league inning, I looked up his Baseball-Reference page. Holdzkom started his pro career as a fourth-round pick by the Mets in the 2006 MLB draft, missed time with Tommy John surgery, had control issues and bounced around, then pitched all of 2013 and the start of 2014 in an independent league before the Pirates signed him in June.&nbsp;

But I wanted to find out a little more details, so I Googled his name. What I found was rather surprising: A transcript on metsminorleagueblog.com of the time Holdzkom allegedly called into Peretti&rsquo;s podcast to chat.&nbsp;

Seriously.&nbsp;

It&rsquo;s pretty funny and revealing&nbsp;stuff. In a few minutes, he touches on topics like the impetuousness of youth, the temptations of having money, reorganizing life priorities and starting a baseball comeback in Australia.&nbsp;

A sampling:&nbsp;


Chelsea: How old are you?
John: I&rsquo;m about 24.
Chelsea: Oh, (expletive). You&rsquo;re just a young man getting a start in this world. How&rsquo;s life going so far as an adult?
John: I&rsquo;ve already blown a small fortune.
Chelsea: You did?
John: Yeah.
Chelsea: Ach, why? What was the fortune? How much is a small fortune, $10 grand?
John: No, when I was 18, the New York Mets gave me $210,000.
Chelsea: Whoa, why?
John: Because they thought I was a good baseball player.
Chelsea: Oh my god. What happened?
John: Just buying sushi every night. Thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m the man. Bought a new car. It&rsquo;ll catch up to ya.


After reading the transcript, I had to know if this really happened. I doubted it was some elaborate hoax, but you can never be too sure. It&rsquo;s the Internet, after all. So, after the game and after a few questions about baseball stuff, I asked him about the podcast.

&ldquo;That is me,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.&nbsp;

Oh, really. So, how did that happen?

&ldquo;I saw her on TV, looked her up on Twitter and the first tweet I saw was, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having a podcast. Call in.&rsquo; And I was bored at home, so I was like, alright. That&rsquo;s what happened. It was just completely random. I probably wish I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that, but oh well.&rdquo;

You can listen to the podcast here.&nbsp;

And you can watch Holdzkom pitch for the Pirates down the stretch. In 22 combined relief appearances for Pittsburgh&#39;s&nbsp;Double-A and Triple-A teams this season, Holdzkom had a 1.95 ERA and struck out 37 in 27 2/3 innings.&nbsp;If he has more in the tank like his debut inning for the Pirates, you might see a lot of him this month.&nbsp;

&quot;He&#39;s obviously got great, great stuff,&quot; Pirates catcher Russell Martin told SN. &quot;Great life to the fastball, and that cut action he&#39;s got, he could just throw that all day and guys are going to have a hard time hitting that. Lot of potential there.&quot;
