Welker suspension is a blessing Welker suspension is a blessing The initial reaction to Tuesday&#8217;s news that Denver Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker was being suspended four games for a violation of the NFL&#8217;s performance-enhancing drug policy after testing positive for a banned amphetamine was pretty typical when it comes to these types of things.
Surprise. Shock. Lots of one-word exclamations from the Twitter echo chamber, especially understandable for a first-time offense from an eleven-year vet and five-time Pro Bowl player.
But the immediate response after that from a lot of people wasn&#8217;t the usual hand wringing over the league&#8217;s drug policy, the timing of the suspension or even a rapid fervor to find out exactly which substance Welker took, although that would certainly come afterwards.
No, one of the first things you heard from both media and fans alike was &#8220;Good. Now he won&#8217;t get another concussion so quickly.&#8221;

After suffering his third concussion in ten months in a preseason game against the Texans two weeks ago, Welker hadn&#8217;t yet been cleared for contact but had begun practicing with the Broncos this week, a sign that he was certainly going to try to get back on the field as soon as he possibly could.
For what it&#8217;s worth, Welker vehemently denies any wrongdoing, telling the Denver Post in an email that &#8220;I would NEVER knowingly take a substance to gain a competitive advantage in any way&#8221; and calling the league&#8217;s drug testing policy &#8220;flawed.&#8221;
With all of the data out there about the lasting effects of repeated concussions, especially ones in such rapid succession, Welker should probably have planned on sitting the year out if not giving serious consideration to calling it a career. But that&#8217;s something his coach John Fox made very clear wasn&#8217;t any part of his player&#8217;s thought process just two days after Welker&#8217;s head injury.
It probably should be. And if the stories of guys like Sean Morey and Wayne Chrebet, two former players with a very similar size and skillset, aren&#8217;t enough to deter Welker from rushing back to absorb more potential punishment, this might be the first time in league history that a positive drug test was indeed a positive, &#8220;flawed&#8221; or not.
