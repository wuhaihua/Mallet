Oral-B USA 500 results: Complete finishing order Oral-B USA 500 results: Complete finishing order Aug 17, 2014; Brooklyn, MI, USA; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Kasey Kahne prior to the Pure Michigan 400 at Michigan International Speedway. Mandatory Credit: Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsNASCAR    Oral-B USA 500 results The Oral-B USA 500 is in the books, as Kasey Kahne&nbsp;came away with the checkered flag at Atlanta Motor Speedway for his first win of the season to punch his ticket to the Chase for the Cup.  It was a wild ending, after a late yellow flag came out when Martin Truex Jr. smacked the wall. The yellow flag led to Kasey Kahne dropping out of first place and a wild two-lap shootout for the checkered flag. Unfortunately, on the restart Kevin Harvick hit the wall and drew another yellow flag after some contact with Joey Logano because of a poor restart from Paul Menard. On the second attempt at a green-white-checkered finish, Kasey Kahne got a great restart and managed to get past Kenseth after a slight wiggle. It was a great turnaround for Kahne, who appeared to lose his shot at reaching the Chase after the poor pit stop on the earlier yellow flag. Kasey Kahne also punched his ticket to the Chase on points.
