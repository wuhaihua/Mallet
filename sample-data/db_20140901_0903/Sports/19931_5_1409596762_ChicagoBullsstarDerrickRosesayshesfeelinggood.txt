Mandatory Credit: Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY SportsFIBA World Cup    While Chicago Bulls fans are understandably excited to see Derrick Rose participating with Team USA in the FIBA World Cup, they&rsquo;re likely doing so with one eye winced shut.  Sure, it&rsquo;s awesome to see Rose back on the hardwood but there is understandable concern that his playing time could be a problem for the Chicago Bulls this season. For now though that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case as Rose, who played in back-to-back games for Team USA says he&rsquo;s feeling just fine. &ldquo;I know the questions are going to come and they&rsquo;re going to be there the whole year. So I can&rsquo;t get tired of it. I&rsquo;m feeling good right now. Just trying to get in better shape, get in better condition, so that when I do need to score the ball, then it&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo; Although Derrick Rose came off the bench in Team USA&rsquo;s victory over Turkey on Sunday night, he ended up playing the most minutes (23) of any player on the roster and seems to be doing well from a physical standpoint. If there is a positive for the Chicago Bulls by allowing Derrick Rose to participate for Team USA, it&rsquo;s that he won&rsquo;t need much (if any) time to acclimate himself with the game again. Not only will he be ready from skills standpoint, he&rsquo;ll also have conditioned his body for the rigors of an NBA game. Often you&rsquo;ll see a player return from injury and take a few weeks to return to form, struggling catching their breath or getting tired easily. That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case for Rose, assuming he is to remain healthy.
