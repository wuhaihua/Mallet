Mandatory Credit: RVR Photos-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The Alabama Crimson Tide survived a very early scare on Saturday afternoon in their season opener against the West Virginia Mountaineers in Atlanta, coming away with a 33-23 victory. Aside from the rude awakening that there are a lot of areas on this team that need fixing, the Tide suffered a minor setback at the wide receiver position>  White caught six passes for 73 yards in the close win on Saturday, before leaving the game with a shoulder injury. After the game, head coach Nick Saban announced that White had suffered a separated shoulder, and could miss about a week of action. &ldquo;DeAndrew White has a little separated shoulder,&rdquo; Saban said,&nbsp;per al.com. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really bad. I haven&rsquo;t talked to the doctor yet, but [he may be out] a week or so, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; White proved in the game to be a perfect complement to Amari Cooper, as he consistently bailed the Tide out of the unexpected trouble that West Virginia provided. The good news for Alabama is that their next two games are against FAU and Southern Miss, so they have a good chance of getting White back by the time they face off against the Florida Gators on September 20.
