			Former Australia seamer Glenn McGrath has signed a five-year deal with the India cricket board to help develop the country’s next generation of fast bowlers.McGrath, 44, is director of the MRF Pace Foundation – an academy for young seamers set up in Chennai, India, by Australia legend Dennis Lillee.Under the BCCI agreement, McGrath, who took 563 Test wickets during an illustrious 14-year career, will coach the academy’s students on regular visits to the country."It has been a wonderful couple of years for me at the MRF Pace Foundation," said McGrath, who replaced Lillee in 2012."Our facilities compare favourably with the best in the world and I am eagerly looking forward to this challenge and working with India's best at the foundation.”India's fast bowling options have been considered limited over the last few years, with only Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan having taken over 100 Test wickets out of the current squad – and Khan has dwindled in recent seasons.India were comprehensively beaten 3-1 in the five-match series in England this summer and will travel to Australia in November to play a four-Test series before a 50-over tri-series that also involves England.
