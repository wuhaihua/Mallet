                    CLEVELAND &mdash; Rex Grossman lost his tutoring gig with the Browns.

The veteran quarterback was released Sunday by Cleveland, leaving starter Brian Hoyer and rookie backup Johnny Manziel as the only QBs on the Browns&#39; roster.



Grossman signed with the Browns as a free agent on Aug. 12, brought in because of his experience running coordinator Kyle Shanahan&#39;s offense. Grossman and Shanahan spent four seasons together in Washington and one in Houston. Grossman was able to help Hoyer and Manziel, who struggled with Cleveland&#39;s new schemes throughout training camp the preseason.

Both Hoyer and Manziel had praised Grossman for making Shanahan&#39;s offense easier.

The 33-year-old Grossman played in Cleveland&#39;s final exhibition on Thursday night against Chicago, completing 4 of 8 passes for 80 yards.

&quot;You see that he still has the arm,&quot; Browns coach Mike Pettine said after the Browns&#39; 33-13 win. &quot;If you said, &#39;Draw me a quarterback.&#39; I don&#39;t think you&#39;d draw Rex Grossman, but he can still make all the throws. He can plant his back foot in the ground, and he can still sling it.&quot;

Grossman led the Bears to the Super Bowl in the 2006 season. He&#39;s 25-22 as a career starter with 10,232 yards and 56 touchdowns.

The Browns continued to tweak their roster, waiving wide receiver Charles Johnson, who missed last season after undergoing knee surgery. Cleveland also was awarded wide receiver LaRon Byrd (Dallas), offensive linemen Caylin Hauptmann (Seattle) and Ryan Seymour (San Francisco) and running back Glenn Winston (San Francisco) off waivers.

Offensive lineman James Brown, defensive lineman Jacobbi McDaniel, tight end Emmanuel Ogbuehi and linebackers Keith Pough and Justin Staples were signed to the practice squad.
