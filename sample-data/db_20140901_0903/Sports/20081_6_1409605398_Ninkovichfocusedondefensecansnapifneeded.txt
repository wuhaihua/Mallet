Ninkovich focused on defense, can snap if needed Ninkovich focused on defense, can snap if needed September 1, 2014, 3:45 pm FOXBORO -- As of Monday afternoon, the Patriots did not have a full-time long-snapper on their 53-man active roster. They announced that they had signed snapper Charley Hughlett to be one of their 10 practice-squad members, but until he's signed to the 53-man roster he won't be eligible to participate in Sunday's Week 1 game against the Dolphins.
For now, that means edge defender Rob Ninkovich is their best option to snap on field goals and punts this weekend. A starter on defense, Ninkovich has long been the team's backup long snapper in case of an emergency situation popped up.
Ninkovich was asked by reporters if he'd be ready to snap in Miami if called upon.
"Whatever it is I'm doing, we all have multiple roles," he said. "I'm gonna focus in on playing defense -- and special teams, I've done it in the past. It's something that if there was ever an opportunity for me to do it, I could go out there and do it. I've done it before."  
Ninkovich explained that he's continued to practice long snapping even though the bulk of his responsibilities come as a pass-rusher and edge-setter at the line of scrimmage. 
 
"I've been doing it for a long time now," he said. "It's something that I've always worked on, constantly worked at. I've been able to use that, have that in my back pocket whenever there's an issue. [If the] snapper hurts his hand or something, I can go out there and get the job done. That just comes with high school doing it, college doing it, and [it's] just another one of those things that can help the team." 
 
Whether or not the Patriots plan to go into Sunday with Ninkovich as the only player on the 46-man game-day roster capable of accurately launching footballs between his legs remains to be seen. If he is, he says he'll be ready.
