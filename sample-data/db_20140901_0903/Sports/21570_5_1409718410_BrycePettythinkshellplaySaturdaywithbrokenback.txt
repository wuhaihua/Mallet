Bryce Petty thinks he'll play Saturday with broken back Bryce Petty thinks he'll play Saturday with broken back Aug 31, 2014; Waco, TX, USA; Baylor Bears quarterback Bryce Petty (14) after the game against the Southern Methodist Mustangs at McLane Stadium. The Bears shut out the Mustangs 45-0. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    You&rsquo;d never know Baylor starting quarterback Bryce Petty has a broken back. It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s in denial. Apparently, he thinks he&rsquo;s going to play in Baylor&rsquo;s game against Northwestern State on Saturday. Yet the way he talks about it, the starting quarterback could be right.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my goal towards the rest of the week,&rdquo; Petty said, via DallasSportsBlog.com. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything worse to it, so if it&rsquo;s bearable, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; Petty fractured two of the transverse processes in his back during Baylor&rsquo;s 45-0 rout against Southern Methodist University. He sustained the injury during the first drive on the game but threw for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He also rushed for a score. The injury isn&rsquo;t fully healed, but Petty explained that he won&rsquo;t worsen it by appearing in Saturday&rsquo;s game. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a pinkie,&rdquo; Petty said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do much except just brace it up and wait for it to heal. Football is football, you have pain. Might as well get rewarded for it. I&rsquo;ve watched for too long, put on the headset too many times for me to sit if I can be out there.&rdquo; Petty was considered a potential Heisman candidate. If he misses games, his candidacy will be affected considerably. And while he did it with a broken back, his stats from his first game didn&rsquo;t help him much either. If he&rsquo;s not 100 percent for Saturday&rsquo;s game, head coach Art Briles said that backup Seth Russell will start in Petty&rsquo;s place. The sophomore isn&rsquo;t a slouch. He has thrown for 551 yards and four touchdowns in his seven game appearances.
