Mandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY SportsGolf    Rory McIlroy clearly isn&rsquo;t too disappointed in his modest, 1-under final round performance in the final round of the Deutsche Bank Championship Monday. After McIlroy came into the day just one stroke off the lead, he finished tied for fifth as playing partner Chris Kirk took the victory. If McIlroy won the event, he would&rsquo;ve been tied the all time record for wins in PGA Playoff events with Tiger Woods at three wins.  Coming back from the event on his private jet, McIlroy&rsquo;s caddie&nbsp;JP Fitzgerald fell asleep clearly after a long weekend lugging around the world No. 1&prime;s bag, and McIlroy didn&rsquo;t give him much time to rest after scaring him while he was asleep and taking a video.&nbsp; McIlroy lost his No. 1 spot in the FedEx Cup rankings as Chris Kirk took over after a strong performance of 15-under par in the Deutsche Bank Championship, the second of four PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff events. McIlroy has had an outstanding season where he won the British Open, Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship all in a row between July and Aug. McIlroy doesn&rsquo;t seem too disappointed he didn&rsquo;t win the Deutsche Bank after he&rsquo;s seen here joking around on his jet. But hey, there&rsquo;s always next week, right?
