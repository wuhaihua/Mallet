                    ST. LOUIS&nbsp;&mdash; Michael Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher, a few hours after clearing waivers.

Sam arrived at Rams Park via through the media entrance Sunday afternoon still looking right at home clad in T-shirt, shorts and flip flips. He shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach who wasn&#39;t afraid to add the first openly gay player to the roster.

All 21 players released Saturday cleared waivers. Sam&#39;s future was a major topic on Twitter, some of it vitriol, some reasoned.

The Rams appeared unlikely to re-sign Sam to the 10-player practice squad because the defensive line is their strongest unit and they need help elsewhere.

The meeting with Sam meeting was postponed a day so he could attend Missouri&#39;s opening victory over South Dakota State.
