Four Phillies pitchers combine to no-hit Atlanta Four Phillies pitchers combine to no-hit Atlanta September 1, 2014, 4:15 pm BOX SCORE
ATLANTA -- Four Phillies pitchers, led by Cole Hamels, combined on a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves on Monday afternoon.
Hamels pitched six no-hit innings, but allowed six base runners and battled a high pitch count.
Jake Diekman and Ken Giles combined on five strikeouts in the seventh and eighth innings and Jonathan Papelbon closed out the no-hitter.
It was the 12th no-hitter in Phillies franchise history (11th in the regular season) and first combined no-hitter. Roy Halladay threw the team’s last no-hitter in the 2010 playoffs. He pitched a perfect game earlier that season.
Ben Revere was the offensive star with five RBIs, one more than he had in his previous 44 games.
Starting pitching reportHamels had good enough stuff to hold the Braves hitless and strike out seven in six innings, but his control was poor. He walked five and hit a batter. He threw 108 pitches, 42 of which were balls.
In 22 starts since May 11, Hamels has allowed just 34 earned runs in 152 2/3 innings for an ERA of 2.00.
The Phillies finally got to Atlanta starter Julio Teheran after he'd held them to three runs in 24 innings over three previous starts this season. This time, the Phils got him for five runs in 6 2/3 innings. However, three of those runs were unearned.
At the plateThe Phillies manufactured a run against Teheran in the second inning. Cody Asche doubled, moved up on a bunt by Hamels and scored on a sacrifice fly to right by Revere. Three innings later, Jimmy Rollins tripled home Hamels, who had led off the sixth with a single. The Phillies had runners at the corners with one out, but failed to get another run home after Ryan Howard grounded into a double play.
The Phils broke the game open on Revere’s bases-loaded triple with two outs in the seventh. The runs were unearned after Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons made an error.
Revere drove in another run with a ninth-inning single.
In the fieldChris Johnson came the closest to having a hit against Hamels -- or anyone else. He smacked a sinking liner to right with men on second and third with two outs in the third inning. Marlon Byrd charged and made a diving catch to save two runs.
IncomingThe Phillies will add several players from Triple A before Tuesday night’s game, most notable corner infielder Maikel Franco, reliever Miguel Alfredo Gonzalez and infielder Cesar Hernandez.
Up nextKyle Kendrick (7-11, 4.97) opposes lefty Mike Minor (6-8, 4.70) on Tuesday night.  BOX SCORE
