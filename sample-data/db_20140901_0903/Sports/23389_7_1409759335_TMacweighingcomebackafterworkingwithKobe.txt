T-Mac weighing comeback after working with Kobe T-Mac weighing comeback after working with Kobe 
           
                    Baseball is out of Tracy McGrady&#39;s system. Basketball, it seems, is not.

The former NBA All-Star is trying to determine if he wants to return to the court. He enlisted none other than Kobe Bryant to help him make the call.

&quot;Yes, I was working out with K.B. to get in shape and see how my body feels,&quot; McGrady wrote Tuesday in an email to Yahoo! Sports&#39; Adrian Wojnarowski. The workouts took place this summer in&nbsp;California, according to Wojnarowski. McGrady&#39;s career was derailed by knee and back injuries.

At this point, writes Wojnarowski, no NBA teams are interested in signing McGrady, who last played for the Spurs in 2013. Two teams were contacted to gauge their interest. Even if a team did&nbsp;want to bring him in, it would have to wait until he completes a basketball tour of China which begins in October, Wojnarowski reports.

McGrady will figure out at that point if he wants to keep the comeback try going.

&quot;The comeback will not happen, unless I have the drive whenever I get back,&quot; McGrady wrote in the email, per Wojnarowski.
