			Belinda Bencic will look to continue her remarkable charge at the US Open when she tackles Shuai Peng at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday.The 17-year-old from Switzerland became the youngest player to reach the quarter-finals since Martina Hingis in 1997 following her victory over ninth seed Jelena Jankovic.Bencic, the world No 58, knows that she has plenty of work to do if she is to emulate the achievement of her compatriot, who went on to win her maiden grand slam 17 years ago.Bencic has a great chance, though, with Peng having never made it past the fourth round of a grand slam.Caroline Wozniacki will look to build on her win over Maria Sharapova by reaching her first grand slam semi-final for three years.ToughThe 10th seed, a finalist in New York in 2009, faces Sara Errani in the last eight – and Wozniacki is confident heading into the match."I never doubted myself," she said. "I work hard every day. I know I have the level to compete against anybody. I can beat anyone on a good day."Sara will be tough and get a lot of balls back. I just have to be aggressive at the right time."Roger Federer is refusing to underestimate Roberto Bautista-Agut despite being a big favourite to reach the quarter-final.The second seed has won five titles at Flushing Meadows – and 24 of his 25 night matches there – however Federer is expecting a tough test against the 17th seed."I've never played him but he's done extremely well," Federer said. "He doesn't miss much. He's consistent. He's got a pretty good first serve.Surprising"He's not the typical Spaniard with a lot of topspin. He plays unbelievably flat actually, which is very surprising, but I'm looking forward to the match."Either seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov or No 20 seed Gael Monfils will be waiting the winner in the last eight, with the duo clashing earlier on Arthur Ashe.Monfils won their previous meeting at the US Open in 2011, however Dimitrov toppled the Frenchman in Bucharest earlier this year.The other half of the men’s fourth round matches take place on Louis Armstrong with Marin Cilic and Gilles Simon clashing for the right to meet Tomas Berdych or Dominic Thiem in the last eight.Despite been ranked higher, 14th-seeded Cilic has lost his four previous meetings with Simon, the No 26 seed, while Berdych and Thiem will be meeting for the first time.
