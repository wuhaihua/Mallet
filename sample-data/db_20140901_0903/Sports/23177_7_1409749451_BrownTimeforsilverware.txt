								Brown: Time for silverware
							
						
					
				
			
			Nathan Brown is desperate to end St Helens’ wait for silverware, starting by claiming the League Leaders’ Shield against Warrington on Thursday.Saints have not won the Challenge Cup or Shield since the 2008 campaign while it was a further two years back in 2006 when the club last won the Grand Final.Former Huddersfield Giants coach Brown knows six years is too long for a club like St Helens to lift silverware, something he is looking to end in Thursday’s game live on Sky Sports.Saints are currently four points clear of Castleford Tigers with two rounds of the regular season remaining and Brown believes claiming top spot would be recognition of the players’ consistency throughout the campaign.Excitement“The guys are very excited. Five or six years is a long time for St Helens to go without picking up any sort of silverware,” Brown told Sky Sports.“If we were to do well (on Thursday) night and get the result it would probably be a really, really good reward for the players for being consistent throughout the year and working hard for each other.“If you look at the top six teams there’s been different stages throughout the year any number of those top six sides have looked like they’re  the team to beat and they’d go on to win the Shield.“For different reasons different sides have had their little flat periods, whether it be through injury or through one or two not so good performances. As a whole I think there are some twists and turns in this competition yet.“Those top six sides through the season have all looked very likely at different stages.”
