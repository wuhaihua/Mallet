Mandatory Credit: David Manning-USA TODAY SportsMLB    The Philadelphia Phillies have been one of Major League Baseball&rsquo;s best teams over the past decade, though this year the organization feel on tough times.  General manager Ruben Amaro Jr. knows his job is on the line if the franchise doesn&rsquo;t improve and do so quickly. Given that, the Philadelphia Phillies are expected to make &lsquo;significant changes&lsquo; come the offseason according to Amaro. Does he believe those changes could be significant? &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think we need it. I think we need it because what we have on our roster right now is not working. How much we&rsquo;ll do will depend on what makes sense for us. We&rsquo;re still kind of assessing what we have. But I think it would behoove us to make some change because we need to be better.&rdquo; There was no clarification regarding if the changes would be on the field or in management position> Philadelphia was of course expected to be major sellers during the July trade deadline though for whatever reason decided to keep their roster intact. That isn&rsquo;t expected to be the case come the offseason as the 2015 Philadelphia Phillies roster sounds like it will be drastically different from the currently employed team. For what it&rsquo;s worth, the job of manager Ryne Sandberg is said to be safe.
