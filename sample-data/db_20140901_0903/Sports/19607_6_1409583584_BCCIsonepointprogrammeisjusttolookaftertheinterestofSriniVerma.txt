		The petitioner in the IPL spot-fixing case and the face of the anti-N Srinivasan camp Aditya Verma on Monday expressed his happiness after Supreme Court decided not to reinstate the Tamil Nadu strongman in BCCI chief&rsquo;s post till Mudgal committee submits its final report.

&ldquo;The BCCI plea had only one motive -- to get Srinivasan back into the board by hook or crook and make him eligible for the post of President another three-year term in the next AGM later this month. What is going on in the BCCI is highly undemocratic,&rdquo; Verma was quoted as saying in a press release.
&ldquo;The BCCI has one-point programme -- to look after the interest of one man and not the game. I am happy that the Honourable Court has not reinstated Srinivasan. The BCCI might try it again but we are going to oppose it,&rdquo; Verma added.
The apex court on Monday granted Mudgal commission&rsquo;s appeal for an extension of two months to submit the final report in the IPL betting and spot fixing scandal during the sixth edition of the cash-rich league.
