Adam Dunn on retirement: 'This is probably going to be it' Adam Dunn on retirement: 'This is probably going to be it'  Adam Dunn is probably about to embark on the final month is his baseball career, and he hopes it turns into two final months.
Dunn told reporters Sunday that this would likely be his final season in the big leagues while discussing the trade that sent him from the White Sox to the Oakland A's.
“This is probably going to be it," Dunn said. "This is probably going to be it. I think that also weighed a lot, too. This is an opportunity. I’ve been playing a long time and haven’t got this opportunity, so I’m going to try to make the most of it.”
Dunn agreed to waive his no-trade clause Sunday, accepting a deal to a team that's in position to reach the postseason, something Dunn has never done in his 14-year career.

“I don’t think (I could be talked out of it)," he said. "Kind of the way that everything’s gone down, and the family. I think you know when it’s time. I feel like now’s as good a time as any.”
Though Dunn isn't done quite yet — he'll be inserted into a lineup in the thick of a pennant race and potentially reach his first postseason — his career numbers are pretty impressive, especially in the home-run department. He had belted 460 long balls entering play Sunday, which ranked 36th on baseball's all-time home run list. His .365 career on-base percentage ranks 26th among active players. Of course, he's also got those strikeouts, 2,352 to be exact, which are the third most in baseball history.
Dunn is hoping he can reach one more milestone before hanging them up: experiencing playoff baseball in October.
"I'm going to a place with a chance to not only get into the postseason but also have a legitimate chance to get a ring," Dunn said. "Those chances don't come too often."
