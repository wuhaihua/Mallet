                    The Pittsburgh Steelers are still convinced they&#39;ll see Johnny Manziel at quarterback in Week 1, even though the rookie quarterback isn&#39;t the Cleveland&nbsp;Browns&#39; No. 1 in Week 1.

Venerable safety Troy Polalmalu, the&nbsp;captain&nbsp;of the Steeelers&#39;&nbsp;defense, told reporters they&#39;re ready for Brian Hoyer&#39;s backup to enter the game in a sub-package.

&quot;The thing about it, New York tried to do that with Tim Tebow a little bit,&quot; Polamalu said. &quot;But Tebow&#39;s a guy you have to just play and play and grind out the entire game. I don&#39;t think Johnny is that type of guy. I think if Johnny came into the game, he would make some splashes, he doesn&#39;t need to get into a rhythm.&quot;

A month ago, when Manziel started No. 2 on the Browns&#39; depth chart -- where he would finish the preseason, too --&nbsp;Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau already had the mindset of preparing for Manziel to start. So don&#39;t expect the&nbsp;wily old schemer to&nbsp;get caught off guard if the athletic&nbsp;whipper snapper would indeed come&nbsp;in for a few plays on Sunday.&nbsp;

The Browns have been putting in&nbsp;wrinkles for Manziel with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan&nbsp;but have been coy about if and how they would use him in conjunction with Hoyer. Unlike Tebow, however, there&#39;s much more of a real dual threat with the more improvisiational Manziel where the Steelers would need to be prepared for just about anything.

That&#39;s good and all, but the Browns went with Hoyer as the opening-day starter because for now, he gives them the best chance to win at hostile Pittsburgh. That&#39;s not a great chance, given how the Steelers have owned the rivalry. To have any chance, they need to work on getting Hoyer into a rhythm and not &quot;looking&nbsp;over his shoulder&quot; with a Manziel cameo breaking that up.

Even if the Steelers&#39; defense rattles and rocks Hoyer in an apparent early blowout, it&#39;s hard to see the Browns just throwing Manziel in there to take a mopup second-half beating in his first NFL game.&nbsp;

We&#39;re sticking with the story that we&#39;ll first see full-tilt&nbsp;Manziel in Week 5 -- as a starter after the Browns&#39; bye.
