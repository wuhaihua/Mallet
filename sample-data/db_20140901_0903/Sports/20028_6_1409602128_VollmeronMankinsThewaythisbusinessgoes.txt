Vollmer on Mankins: 'The way this business goes' Vollmer on Mankins: 'The way this business goes' September 1, 2014, 3:00 pm FOXBORO -- When Logan Mankins was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a fourth-round pick and tight end Tim Wright last week, the Patriots lost their most experienced offensive lineman. He was the unquestioned leader within the position group, a role that will now apparently be taken over by committee. 
Sebastian Vollmer and Dan Connolly have both been starting since the 2009 season, and Nate Solder carries the clout of being a first-round pick in 2011. Vollmer explained that with Mankins gone, the leadership lost can be made up by the core left behind. 
"I think we have a lot good guys on the football team, especially the offensive line," Vollmer said. "It's just kind of the way this business goes. It's time for somebody else to do it. Hopefully we do a good job this week."
Vollmer echoed many of the comments his teammates made last week in regards to the Mankins trade. It's hard to see a friend walk out the door, but he knows the show must go on.
"You never want to lose a guy, but it's that time of year where that kind of thing happens," Vollmer said. "He's not the only one. Obviously he's a friend of a lot of us. I've played a lot of plays with the guy. Now it's time to step up and go forward and play Miami."
