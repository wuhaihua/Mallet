                    Not all champions are built the same, but they share some key mental traits that give them an edge over the competition.

1.&nbsp;Champions know that vague goals lead to vague results. They know exactly what they want to accomplish and think of each day a golden opportunity to chip away at their big-picture goal.

2.&nbsp;Champions don&#39;t care what the obstacles are because they love to battle and get back on top again. Tough times make them even tougher!

3.&nbsp;Champions always play to the max, whether in practice or games. They go out and ball out with their best attitude and a complete effort.&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;Champions learn to make every play (or shot, etc.) count. They relish the poor ones as much as the powerful ones.&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;Champions keep their attitude and work ethic constant throughout the ups and downs that are part of every season. They never let up or give up.

6.&nbsp;Champions understand that the better they get, the harder they need to work. A true champion never thinks in terms of, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got it made.&quot;

7.&nbsp;Champions take as much pleasure in the journey as the destination, the process as much as the product.&nbsp;
