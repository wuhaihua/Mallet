Dolphins' Mike Wallace in store for bounce-back season? Dolphins' Mike Wallace in store for bounce-back season? Dec 15, 2013; Miami Gardens, FL, USA; Miami Dolphins wide receiver Mike Wallace (11) scores a touchdown against the New England Patriots in the first half of the game at Sun Life Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brad Barr-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Miami Dolphins signed wide receiver Mike Wallace to a massive five year, $60 million contract last offseason. It&rsquo;s safe to say Wallace didn&rsquo;t live up to his paycheck in his first year with the team, catching 73 balls for 930 yards and five scores.  But Wallace just might be in store for a bounce-back season, speculates James Walker of ESPN&rsquo;s NFL Nation. Boding well for Walkers&rsquo; prediction is that Wallace recently told the Palm Beach Post that he and quarterback Ryan Tannehill are working on their deep-ball chemistry, a huge element of Wallace&rsquo;s game. It&rsquo;s not going to be one time where we hit it and then it&rsquo;s over. We&rsquo;ve got to continually do it every day. That&rsquo;s why we work, man, and keep working. I know we&rsquo;ve been saying it for a while but I think in two weeks hopefully we can hit one.&rdquo; The Dolphins are surely hoping Walker&rsquo;s beliefs are on the money and the work Wallace and Tannehill are putting in pays off. Miami needs Tannehill to take the next step forward in 2014 and having a top wide receiver to rely on would&nbsp;help that process. Also, the Dolphins ranked 20th in passing yards per game this past season and that simply won&rsquo;t cut it if Miami wants to rebound from an 8-8 season to make a run at the postseason. The Pittsburgh Steelers drafted Wallace with the No. 84 overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. The 28-year-old has 308 catches for 4,972 yards and 37 touchdowns in his career. &nbsp; &nbsp;
