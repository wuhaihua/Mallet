			The latest news from Tuesday's meeting at Goodwood, where Timba overcame relative inexperience to win the opening contest.Timba overcame relative and personal inexperience to fell her four rivals in the EBF Stallions Maiden Fillies' Stakes at Goodwood.John Gosden's juvenile, a George Strawbridge home-bred, went off at 8/1 despite her powerful connections and was the only runner in the line-up not to have raced before.Under only nominal encouragement from William Buick, Timba caught up with Mystic Jade inside the final furlong to win by a length and a quarter."It was a good performance," said Buick. "She's very green but she has won like a nice filly."Soviet Courage was left with a pretty simple task in the Goodwood Racehorse Owners Group Maiden Stakes when two of her opponents dropped out.Ferahya, trained by Roger Varian, and Jo Crowley's Rosarina were both pulled up in the early stages and only four were left in the reckoning.In the end, Ryan Moore pushed 1/3 favourite Soviet Courage 13 lengths clear for success at the sixth attempt.Seamus Buckley, Goodwood's clerk of the course, said Ferayha had been taken for X-rays on the course, while Crowley reported jockey Fergus Sweeney thought Rosarina did not feel right, but that her filly "walked back absolutely fine".Johnny B Goode hit the higher note of Richard Fahey's two runners in the Financial Services Expo Nursery.While 9/4 chance George Bowen came last of the five under Ryan Moore, Andrea Atzeni's 9/2 chance fought hard to build on a recent maiden success at Thirsk.While 15/8 favourite Flash Fire threw down a stern challenge, Atzeni had the stands' rail and clung on by three-quarters of a length.Atzeni said: "I could see Mark Johnston's horse (Flash Fire) coming alongside and it was a big worry but to be fair to my horse, he wouldn't let him by and stuck his neck out."
