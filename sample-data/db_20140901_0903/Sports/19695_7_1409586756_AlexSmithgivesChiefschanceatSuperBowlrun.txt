                    Good help is hard to find. You often hear that claim from employers in search of suitable&nbsp;labor, and it rings as loud in&nbsp;the NFL&nbsp;as anywhere, if not louder.

In a league dominated by the passing game, it&#39;s easy to desire a Mount Rushmore-type&nbsp;quarterback who will put up 4,000 yards each year and set records. But you don&#39;t need a Peyton Manning to win a Super Bowl.

Alex Smith signed a four-year, $68 million contract extension with the Chiefs on Sunday, a signing that prompts doubt regarding the former No. 1 overall draft pick&#39;s actual worth.&nbsp;

The 30-year-old doesn&#39;t put up staggering numbers &mdash; 185.2 average yards per game and&nbsp;an 81.0 average QB rating for his career. But he also doesn&#39;t make mistakes. That&#39;s the kind of player you need at quarterback, the position in which the most control rests, to win a Super Bowl.

We&#39;ve seen it over and over: A high-powered offense will win you a division title and get you a top playoff seed. But defense and mistake-free football will get you a title. Look no further than last season&#39;s debacle in Denver. Postseason matchups feature the league&#39;s top teams, and the best of the best rise to the occasion and differentiate themselves by not turning the ball over. It really is that simple.

Take a look at the last 10 Super Bowl winning quarterbacks and their touchdown-interception ratios throughout their respective playoff runs. The common denominator is taking care of the pigskin.

&mdash; Russell Wilson: 3 touchdowns,&nbsp;0 interceptions

&mdash; Joe Flacco: 11 touchdowns,&nbsp;0 interceptions

&mdash; Eli Manning: 9 touchdowns,&nbsp;1 interception

&mdash; Aaron Rodgers: 9 touchdowns,&nbsp;2 interceptions

&mdash;&nbsp;Drew Brees: 8 touchdowns,&nbsp;0 interceptions

&mdash;&nbsp;Ben Roethlisberger: 3 touchdowns,&nbsp;1 interception

&mdash; Eli Manning: 6 touchdowns,&nbsp;1 interception

&mdash; Peyton Manning: 3 touchdowns,&nbsp;7 interceptions

&mdash;&nbsp;Ben Roethlisberger: 7 touchdowns,&nbsp;3 interceptions

&mdash; Tom Brady: 5 touchdowns,&nbsp;0 interceptions

In an extreme case of irony, Peyton Manning posted the only negative ratio of the group. Joe Flacco, the Ravens quarterback who some would consider the least talented on the list, had the most impressive postseason run.

Smith can be that guy for Kansas City.&nbsp;He&#39;s already proven so in three career playoff starts &mdash; 9 touchdowns, 0 interceptions.

With the&nbsp;franchise quarterback inked, the Chiefs can now focus on their&nbsp;actual&nbsp;offensive roster holes that&nbsp;prevent a championship &mdash; the offensive line and wide receivers. QB isn&#39;t the KC culprit.&nbsp;

Chiefs fans shouldn&#39;t complain about keeping a seemingly mediocre quarterback around&nbsp;a few more years. For some perspective, just ask Buccaneers/Jets/Bills/Rams/Raiders/Jaguars/Titans/Texans/Browns fans if they&#39;d want Smith.

They&#39;ll tell you good help is hard to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;
