			Derbyshire have announced the signing of Leicestershire all-rounder Shiv Thakor on a two-year deal.Thakor, a former England Under-19s captain, will move to Derby for next season and has committed himself until the end of the 2016 campaign.Leicestershire confirmed they offered Thakor a new two-year contract and are "disappointed" with his decision to leave.The 20-year-old has already played 24 first-class matches, where he has made two hundreds, nine fifties and averages just under 40, and showed his burgeoning promise with the ball by bowling Virat Kohli in India's tour match at Leicestershire earlier this year.Passion"It's been a tough decision to leave the county that has given me my start in professional cricket, but I feel it's time to take the next step forward," said Thakor."I had several options on the table but, having met with (elite performance director) Graeme Welch and the management team; it was an easy decision to join a progressive club like Derbyshire."The way he talked with passion about the club, its plans for the future and the role he sees me playing was too good an opportunity to turn down."He is the latest in a long line of highly promising players to leave Leicestershire for pastures new in recent years, following the likes of Stuart Broad, James Taylor, Harry Gurney - who all left for Nottinghamshire - and James Allenby, who joined Glamorgan.
