Photo Credit: Scott Garfield, Columbia Pictures via USA TodayEntertainment    In the weeks that have been leading up to the eventual release of the action-packed thriller The Equalizer, we have seen plenty of teasers, TV Spots, and even a few clips; however, a good portion of it has contained a a great deal of the same material.  Thankfully, Columbia Pictures has seen fit to rectify this issue rather quickly. We now have a look at a new full-length trailer for The Equalizer that unloads a lot of new footage from the film and gives us a deeper look at what we can expect from the new film. In The Equalizer, Denzel Washington plays a man by the name of Robert McCall, a former black ops commando who went as far as to fake his own death in order to get out of the business and live a peaceful and happy existence. Unfortunately, old habits die hard, and when he sees a young girl by the name of Teri in trouble, he makes it his mission to intervene and stick up for what he knows is right when others are unable to do so. He may be a little rusty after his time away from the business; however, we can assure that he is not the man you want to come up against in a fight. 19 seconds is still a pretty short amount of time to clear a room. Why don&rsquo;t you check it out for yourselves? Here&rsquo;s a look at the latest trailer for the upcoming film The Equalizer. &nbsp; The new trailer also features the new single &ldquo;Guts Over Fear&rdquo; from Eminem feat. Sia. The Equalizer&nbsp;is being directed by&nbsp;Antoine Fuqua. This film should be a perfect fit for a director like Fuqua. He has directed plenty of action films like&nbsp;Olympus Has Fallen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Brooklyn&rsquo;s Finest. It&rsquo;s also not the first time that he has worked with Washington. Fuqua directed the film&nbsp;Training Day&nbsp;as well. The script for the film was penned by&nbsp;Richard Wenk. Much like Fuqua, he has experience in the action realm as he penned the script for&nbsp;The Expendables 2. Of course, this is all based on the 1985 television series from&nbsp;Michael Sloan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Richard Lindheim. The film stars&nbsp;Denzel Washington&nbsp;as Robert McCall.&nbsp;The Equalizer&nbsp;also stars&nbsp;Kick-Ass&nbsp;actress&nbsp;Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz,&nbsp;Bill Pullman,&nbsp;Melissa Leo,&nbsp;Robert Wahlberg,&nbsp;Marton Csokas,&nbsp;Haley Bennett, and many more. The Equalizer&nbsp;is scheduled to be released on&nbsp;September 26, 2014. &nbsp;
