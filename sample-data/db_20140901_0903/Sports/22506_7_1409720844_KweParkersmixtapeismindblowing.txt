                    There were two players who got a chance to show off their dunking skills in front of Chris Paul at his point guard camp in Winston-Salem, N.C. last month &mdash; Keifer Sykes and Class of 2016 guard Kwe Parker.&nbsp;

Parker, a 6-2 high school junior, has some pretty insane athleticism, which he showed off at the camp and also in his latest mixtape.



There are multiple dunks where his head is inches above the rim. That&#39;s some serious bounce.



The Fayetteville, N.C., native has offers from Charlotte, Clemson, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest and Western Carolina, according to 24/7 Sports, but you can expect the young point guard to see a spike in national interest this fall.
