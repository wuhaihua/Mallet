                    Each week, SN college football writer Bill Bender will look at the must-know statistical trends across the nation.

It&#39;s one thing to play red-zone defense. It&#39;s quite another not to let the other team in the red zone at all.&nbsp;

Stanford, Texas and Pittsburgh were the only  in Week 1. The Cardinal shut out UC Davis 45-0, and their success isn&#39;t surprising.&nbsp;

Texas and Pittsburgh, however, should be encouraged.&nbsp;

Texas bullied North Texas 38-7 in Charlie Strong&#39;s debut. The Longhorns allowed just 94 total yards, a big step up for a defense that allowed 407.2 yards per game last season. Remember, Strong had the No. 1 statistical defense in yards per game at Louisville last season.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Texas had more interceptions (four) than completions allowed (three) against the Mean Green, which had a nation-worst -22 passing efficiency. If the Longhorns keep playing defense like that, a full-scale turnaround will be quicker than expected.&nbsp;

The Panthers allowed just 57 total yards in a 62-0 win against Delaware, the fewest yards allowed in Week 1. Pitt faces Boston College on Friday, which allowed UMass just one red-zone trip last week. Which team plays better defense?&nbsp;
