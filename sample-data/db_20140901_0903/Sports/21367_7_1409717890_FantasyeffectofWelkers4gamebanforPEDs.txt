                    The NFL has suspended Broncos receiver Wes&nbsp;Welker&nbsp;four games for violating the league&#39;s policy on performance-enhancing substances,&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;outlets reported on Monday.&nbsp;Welker won&#39;t be reinstated until Week 6, as the Broncos are on bye in Week 4.

It&#39;s obviously another damaging&nbsp;blow to his fantasy value -- Welker&nbsp;falls all the way to No. 40 in our preseason WR rankings -- but here&#39;s something that will hurt Welker owners even more:&nbsp;According to Fox Sports&#39; Jay Glazer, the Broncos &quot;have known about Welker&#39;s suspension&quot; since before training camp and were &quot;holding out hope&quot; it would be turned over on appeal. In other words, fantasy owners could have avoided Welker, who already came with concussion worries, altogether.&nbsp;



Here&#39;s the good news, assuming&nbsp;you didn&#39;t draft Welker or at least handcuffed him: newcomer Emmanuel Sanders figures to be the biggest beneficiary, picking up Welker&#39;s&nbsp;vacated targets&nbsp;for the first four games at least. That could move him ahead of Welker&nbsp;in the receiver hierarchy even in Week 6 and beyond. &nbsp;

There will also be more looks for studs&nbsp;Demaryius Thomas and Julius Thomas, especially on quick strikes in the&nbsp;red zone. But fantasy owners looking to make a speculative move based on this news should look at the No. 3 receiver in Denver.&nbsp;Rookie Cody Latimer&nbsp;has the talent and upside, but&nbsp;may not be ready for prime time, or a slot role. That&nbsp;could leave veteran Andre Caldwell getting some of&nbsp;Welker&#39;s slot work, making him a PPR sleeper.

We&#39;re not expecting the Broncos to miss a beat without Welker, so don&#39;t worry about Peyton Manning. That said, it&#39;s a reminder that if everything isn&#39;t going right&nbsp;with the Broncos&#39; passing game, Manning could have a tough time matching last year&#39;s record-setting season.&nbsp;He&#39;ll be fine for the first month, but another significant&nbsp;loss in the Broncos&#39; receiving corps could have Manning&nbsp;owners regretting that&nbsp;first-round pick.&nbsp;
