Mandatory Credit: Crystal LoGiudice-USA TODAY SportsNBA    If the Phoenix Suns wind up signing restricted free agent guard Eric Bledsoe to a long-term deal, their three best players &nbsp;- Bledsoe, Goran Dragi&#263; and Isaiah Thomas, who was acquired in a sign-and-trade with the Sacramento Kings this offseason, would all play the same position> Chuck Myron of Hoops speculates the Suns could put Dragi&#263; on the trade block if they re-sign Bledsoe. Goran Dragic can hit free agency next summer, too, so if the Suns wind up opening their wallets for Eric Bledsoe on a long-term deal, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see Dragic on the block, either. The Indiana Pacers reportedly tried to trade for Dragi&#263; earlier in the offseason, offering center Roy Hibbert as part of the return but the Suns rejected the deal. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine trading a player like Dragi&#263; right now but if Bledsoe and Thomas are both in the fold, it certainly isn&rsquo;t impossible. Bledsoe averaged 17.7 points, 5.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game while shooting 47.7% from the field, 35.7% from beyond the arc and 77.2% from the free throw line last season. The 18th-overall pick of the 2010 NBA Draft has put up 8.7 points, 3.4 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 44.5% from the floor, 32.7% from three and 75.9% from the charity stripe.&nbsp;Dragi&#263; put up 20.3 points, 5.9 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 50.5% from the floor, 40.8% from three and 76.0% from the charity stripe last season. In his six-year career, Dragi&#263; has gone for 11.5 points, 4.5 assists, 2.5 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game while shooting 46.1% from the floor, 36.5% from three and 74.7% from the foul line.
