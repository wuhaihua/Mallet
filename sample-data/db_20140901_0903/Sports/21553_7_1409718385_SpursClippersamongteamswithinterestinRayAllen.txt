                    What could be Ray Allen&#39;s final bout with NBA free agency has moved at a snail&#39;s pace. Allen has maintained that he has no reason to rush, yet the suitors remain lined&nbsp;up for his services.&nbsp;

Allen was expected to follow LeBron James to the Cleveland Cavaliers. While they are still in the picture, the Los Angeles Clippers and San Antonio Spurs have been added to the list of teams who want Allen, according to ESPN.com. The Dallas Mavericks could be another team with interest in Allen.&nbsp;

Allen will enter into his 19th&nbsp;NBA season when he makes a decision. Based on the current list, Allen doesn&#39;t have any bad options. He can team up with James in Cleveland, join his former coach Doc Rivers in Los Angeles or play alongside Tim Duncan in San Antonio.&nbsp;
