			Leyton Orient knocked out the holders Peterborough with a deserved 3-2 victory away at London Road in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy first round.Star striker Chris Dagnell bagged two while Josh Barnett scored his first goal in an Orient shirt after signing for the club this summer but Russell Slade’s side were given a nervy finish when defender Romain Vincelot was sent-off.Dagnell opened the scoring after just four minutes when he latched onto free-kick into the penalty area, unmarked, and headed past Ben Alnwick into the far corner.But Peterborough, who beat Chesterfield to clinch to trophy at Wembley last season, hit back through debutant Marcus Maddison, who unleashed a fierce low drive into the corner on 17 minutes.Dagnell added his second just after the break when his superior movement got the better of Christian Burgess and he was able to guide a volley over a stranded Alnwick, and it was 3-1 when Barnett flicked in Dagnell’s cross shortly after.Vincelot was dismissed for a second bookable offence late on and substitute and newcomer Luke James scored his first for the club in stoppage time but it was too little too late for Posh.Elsewhere in the JPT first round, Rochdale, Carlisle, Morecambe and Portsmouth all progressed with convincing away wins, while Gillingham and Coventry also edged victories on their travels.Oldham, Barnsley, Cheltenham, Crawley, Notts County, Preston and Scunthorpe all won comfortably at home and are in the draw for round two.
