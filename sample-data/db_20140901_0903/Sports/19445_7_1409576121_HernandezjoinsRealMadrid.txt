			Real Madrid have signed Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez on a season-long loan deal.The Mexico international will move to the Bernabeu on an initial temporary basis, but Real have the option to make the deal permanent next summer.The European champions announced the deal in a short statement on their website and said Hernandez would be pressented to the media later on deadline day.Hernandez's departure - after four seasons at Old Trafford - follows news of Manchester United's move for Colombia striker Radamel Falcao, who was linked with Real all summer.The Mexican has scored 37 Premier League goals for United but has become increasingly marginalised since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.Hernandez started six league games last season and has played just 45 minutes of this season's competition under Louis van Gaal.
