			New Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck is a doubt for England's friendly against Norway on Wednesday, while Newcastle's Jack Colback will miss the game.Forward Welbeck picked up a knock in training and is unlikely to be risked, while midfielder Colback is unavailable because of a minor injury suffered in United's match against Crystal Palace.England boss Roy Hodgson has included three other uncapped newcomers alongside Colback in the squad, and he will cast one final eye over before their first Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday.Calum Chambers, Fabian Delph and Danny Rose have made the cut following the retirements of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, but they are not expected to start against the Norwegians.Chelsea defender Gary Cahill and Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took part in a recovery session on Monday after sustaining minor injuries while playing for their clubs at the weekend, but should be fit for Wednesday.Norway are 53rd in the FIFA world rankings, 33 spots below England in 20th, Â and last reached the European Championship finals in 2000.
