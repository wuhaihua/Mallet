                    Cristiano Ronaldo feels Manchester United&#39;s loan signing of Radamel Falcao is a &quot;fantastic&quot; piece of business and will give the underperforming squad a boost.

The Colombian completed his season-long switch from Monaco on transfer deadline day after Louis van Gaal beat out interest from Manchester City and Arsenal.

United will pay a 12.5 million euro loan fee and a significant portion of his &euro;380,000-a-week wages but Ronaldo feels Falcao - who was also linked with a move to Real Madrid - is a coup for his former club.

&quot;He is a very good player, I think Manchester United have done well to sign him,&quot; Ronaldo told reporters. &quot;We are talking about a top player here and a fantastic signing.&quot;

Falcao became United&#39;s sixth major summer signing after Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Angel Di Maria and Daley Blind, but the club has yet to record a competitive win under new boss Van Gaal.

A home loss to Swansea on the opening day of the Premier League season was followed by draws with Sunderland and Burnley and a 4-0 Capital One Cup humiliation at the hands of lower-league MK Dons.

Ronaldo has backed Falcao is improve United&#39;s fortunes, with his arrival proving a boost for his new teammates.

He continued: &quot;Manchester United have not had a good start with only two points, so the squad needed someone of Falcao&#39;s quality.&quot;
