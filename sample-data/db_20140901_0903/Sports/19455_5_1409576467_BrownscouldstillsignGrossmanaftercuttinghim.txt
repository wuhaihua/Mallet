Mandatory Credit: Ron Schwane-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Cleveland Browns recently cut quarterback Rex Grossman as the team trimmed down to a 53-man roster. While some speculated this could be the latest &lsquo;end of the road&rsquo; for the 34-year-old Grossman, Browns coach Mike Pettine was quick to note that nothing was final, hinting at the possibility that the team could bring Grossman back in some capacity.  &ldquo;As you know, the 48 hours after the deadline there&rsquo;s a lot of movement with the roster,&rdquo; Pettine said per ESPN. &ldquo;So I wouldn&rsquo;t read too much into where it stands right now. There are some guys that aren&rsquo;t here, potentially could come back; some guys that are here that won&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo; One sticking point is Grossman&rsquo;s contract. The team could be waiting until after Week 1, when Grossman&rsquo;s contract loses its guaranteed status. No guarantees would make a contract offer to a third quarterback much more palatable for the Browns. Rex Grossman has rarely lit the world on fire with his quarterback play, leading many to believe his days are numbered in the NFL, but they&rsquo;ve said that before and Grossman still emerges on an annual basis thanks to his experience starting in the NFL. Helping him further with the Browns will be his familiarity with Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s offensive system. As Ashley Fox notes in the ESPN piece, &ldquo;Reading between the lines, will Grossman be back? My guess is that ultimately, yes, he will be.&rdquo;      &nbsp; &nbsp;
