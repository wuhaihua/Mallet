Louisville celebrates ACC debut by pounding Miami again Louisville celebrates ACC debut by pounding Miami again 
           
                    LOUISVILLE, Ky. &mdash; Dominique Brown&#39;s 15-yard touchdown run in the third quarter and Gerald Christian&#39;s 10-yard TD catch late in the fourth backed Louisville&#39;s big defensive performance that helped beat Miami 31-13 Monday night.

The victory provided a successful Atlantic Coast Conference debut for the Cardinals (1-0, 1-0 ACC) and to Bobby Petrino&#39;s second coaching stint at the school.

Despite the 18-point margin, Louisville showed little of the offensive efficiency expected in Petrino&#39;s return as the Cardinals outgained the Hurricanes (0-1, 0-1) 336-244 in a ragged game offensively for both teams. Louisville&#39;s new 3-4 defense provided the saving grace with three takeaways, including one that followed a costly fumble by Cardinals quarterback Will Gardner inside his 15.

After Louisville held Miami to a field goal following Gardner&#39;s second fumble in the third quarter, Brown&#39;s TD provided a 21-13 cushion. Christian&#39;s scoring pass from Gardner with 1:43 remaining sealed the win.

Corvin Lamb&#39;s 97-yard kickoff return for a TD just before halftime provided the go-ahead score for Louisville, which had to withstand several Miami threats from there for a win that wasn&#39;t decided until late.

Gerod Holliman&#39;s interception of Hurricanes freshman Brad Kaaya and 61-yard return to Miami&#39;s 36 as time expired punctuated Louisville&#39;s gutsy defense.

Brown finished with career bests of 33 carries for 143 yards. Gardner completed 20 of 28 passes for 206 yards with two TDs.

The atmosphere was charged from the moment Petrino led the &quot;Cards March&quot; into Papa John&#39;s Cardinal Stadium in late afternoon.

Several hours later the Cardinals took the field under the lights in all-black uniforms with matching chrome helmets to thunderous cheers from a record crowd of 55,428, all but a few dressed in black.

Both teams provided additional drama as Louisville unveiled a new quarterback in Gardner, who was Teddy Bridgewater&#39;s backup last season. The Cardinals also broke in seven new starters along with an alignment that proved to be ooportunistic.

Miami featured a newcomer at QB as well in Kaaya and welcomed back tailback Duke Johnson from a broken ankle. Some Hurricanes players also harbored hard feelings after last year&#39;s bowl humiliation. Louisville routed Miami, 36-9, in the Russell Athletic Bowl.
