While Palace have not revealed the cost involved, the deal is reported to be for a fee of £7million.
McArthur joined Wigan in 2010 and their boss Uwe Rosler has said that Palace's offer was too good to turn down.
In a statement on the club's official website, Rosler said: "James is a fantastic professional; we wanted to keep him but the offer was a very good one and we have made a decision which we feel is correct for the long-term benefit of the club. We wish him all the best."
