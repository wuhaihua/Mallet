St. Louis Rams do not add Michael Sam to practice squad St. Louis Rams do not add Michael Sam to practice squad Aug 23, 2014; Cleveland, OH, USA; St. Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam (96) during warm ups before the game against the St. Louis Rams at FirstEnergy Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The St. Louis Rams signed 10 players to their practice squad and Michael Sam is not a member of the squad after the team released one of their four seventh round picks on Saturday.  Sam faced an uphill battle to make the 53-man roster with the Rams loaded at the defensive end position> The NFL expanded the practice squad rosters form eight to 10 last month, but even the increased practice squad did not help Sam catch on with an NFL team. He cleared waivers and is free to sign with any NFL team wanting to add the 2013 co-SEC Defensive Player of the Year to their roster. Naturally, with that comes the added media attention with Sam trying to be the first openly gay football player on an active roster and some teams could be put off by that unwanted attention. When Sam was going through the predraft process he said he just wanted to be judged by his ability as a football player and NFL front offices, coaches and players echoed those sentiments and said he would be judged like any other player. Like many seventh round picks found out last weekend, a spot on the 53-man roster is no sure thing and his inability to help the Rams on special teams and with holes at other position> The Rams signed LB Denicos Allen, WR Emory Blake, S Christian Bryant, DT Matt Conrath, S Matt Daniels, QB Garrett Gilbert, T Sean Hooey, LB Kevin Reddick, WR Justin Veltung and G Brandon Washington, according to the team&rsquo;s official website. &nbsp;
