                    How often do college football fans get to hold something over the SEC?&nbsp;Florida State fans aren&#39;t done bragging about their win over Auburn in the 2014 BCS National Championship game.&nbsp;

Joseph Johnson, a graphic designer and Florida State fan, designed&nbsp;a shirt that denotes the&nbsp;end of the SEC&#39;s run of national championships, and did so in the school&#39;s colors.

The SEC was responsible for seven consecutive BCS titles until the final game of the BCS era&nbsp;when Florida State defeated Auburn with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive led by Jameis Winston. The Seminoles went on to win,&nbsp;34-31.&nbsp;

This isn&#39;t Johnson&#39;s first shirt. He&#39;s completed one other shirt inspired by FSU coach Jimbo Fisher&#39;s pregame speech.

But he isn&#39;t restricted to just FSU. In an attempt to launch a clothing line, Bring That Noise, he also unveiled this Tennessee design.

Johnson, who isn&#39;t affiliated with FSU, told Sporting News by phone that he was born in Tallahassee and has been a lifelong Seminoles fan, even naming his son after Warrick Dunn &mdash; Carter Dunn Johnson.

More than likely, this shirt will be worn for years to come. If you want yours, Johnson told SN the prices run from $20-25 with shipping.
