Emery OK with Briggs missing practice for restaurant opening Emery OK with Briggs missing practice for restaurant opening  Linebacker Lance Briggs was excused from practice on Monday, the start of game-week preparations for the regular season. The reason was to allow him to travel to California to open a restaurant, a decision that created questions and some possible doubts.
The absence was announced on Monday by coach Marc Trestman with the explanation that the day had been agreed to some weeks ago. GM Phil Emery, answering a fan’s questions on a ChicagoBears.com chat, stood behind the decision but refused to elaborate on details.
“Lance Briggs was excused for personal reasons,” Emery wrote. “As any employer would do, we will always respect the privacy of our players, whether that concerns absence from work, injuries or medical history or contract status.”
The Bears have been preparing for the Buffalo Bills as far back as training camp, Monday’s practice was in shorts, and Briggs is undoubtedly more than up to speed with any game plans.

But the situation leaves the Bears and Briggs open to significant questions, particularly after the defense and Briggs in particular was shredded in a 31-0 first half at Seattle. The game may have been just preseason but if there were positives in the performances, they were difficult to see.
From at least one player’s perspective, the matter of a teammate missing a game-week practice for something less than dire was beyond understanding.
Recently retired long-snapper Patrick Mannelly, in his new capacity now as talk-show host on WSCR-AM 670 The Score’s with Matt Spiegel, was dumbfounded.
“I don’t understand why Coach Trestman let him take that day off. The other thing is, today is their day off. Why didn’t he go today? I’m floored. As a teammate, if they missed OTAs for whatever reason—if they had a charity golf tournament—I just didn’t understand that, either. You need to give your full commitment to the team.”
