Miami Heat sign former Duke product Andre Dawkins Miami Heat sign former Duke product Andre Dawkins Mar 21, 2014; Raleigh, NC, USA; Duke Blue Devils guard Andre Dawkins (34) shoots the ball over Mercer Bears forward Darious Moten (22) in the first half of a menNBA    The Miami Heat continue to build their roster and this time they&rsquo;ve declined to take a chance on a young talent, former Duke product Andre Dawkins.  While Dawkins didn&rsquo;t star at Duke, he was very productive in his bench role. The 6&rsquo;4 reserve was one of the Blue Devils&rsquo; top scoring threats off the pine and ended up averaging 7.9 points in just over 13 minutes per contest in the tough ACC. That sadly wasn&rsquo;t enough to get him drafted, though that&rsquo;s not to say he wasn&rsquo;t of interest to prospective NBA front offices who were said to be eying the deep-ball threat. Alas, it was the Miami Heat who were able to convince him to join their franchise. The lure of recent success and South Beach likely played a role in his decision to sign for training camp where he&rsquo;s expected to make a minimum salary, though a partial guarantee is likely. Undrafted guard Andre Dawkins has agreed on a training camp deal with the Miami Heat, sources tell RealGM. Averaged 7.9 PPG as Duke senior. &mdash; Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 2, 2014  If Andre Dawkins&rsquo; name sounds familiar to Miami Heat fans, that&rsquo;s because he participated on their Summer League team this offseason and did very well in the few minutes of action he received. During Miami&rsquo;s four Summer League contests, Dawkins put up an average of 12 points per game in 19 minutes, but more importantly shot well from the arc. That&rsquo;s something he did well at Duke too, knocking down over 42 percent of his deep shots at the college level.
