			Leeds and England full-back Zak Hardaker is to be investigated once more by the Rugby Football League for using homophobic language.The RFL has confirmed it has launched a probe into an incident  during the Rhinos 13-12 defeat by St Helens on Friday night.It is believed that the investigation relates too comments made towards St Helens second rower Mark Flanagan by Hardaker, who was banned for five matches in June after being found guilty of homophobic abuse of a referee."We are investigating an incident during the Super League match against St Helens," said an RFL spokesman.If Hardaker is charged and found guilty of the offence, he could face a suspension of up to eight matches.Such a punishment would not only end his season with Leeds but would cast a doubt over his availability for England's Four Nations tour Down Under.
