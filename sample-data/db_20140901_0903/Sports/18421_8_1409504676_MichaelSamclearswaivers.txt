Michael Sam clears waivers Michael Sam clears waivers Michael Sam is a free agent.The rookie defensive end cleared waivers Sunday, one day after the St. Louis Rams cut Sam in their final roster reduction, a person with knowledge of the process told USA TODAY Sports.The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the NFL hadn't announced the results of the waiver period, which expired at noon Sunday for all players waived by Saturday's 4 p.m. deadline.The next question is whether Sam – who is trying to become the NFL's first openly gay player – will return on the Rams' 10-man practice squad or perhaps sign with another team's practice squad in hopes of more quickly ascending to a 53-man roster.A seventh-round draft pick, Sam, 24, had three sacks in the preseason. But the Rams kept undrafted rookie Ethan Westbrooks as their ninth defensive lineman instead.
