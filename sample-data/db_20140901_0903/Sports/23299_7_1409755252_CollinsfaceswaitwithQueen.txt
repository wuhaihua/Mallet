			Tracey Collins has her fingers firmly crossed Majestic Queen gets a run in the Betfred Sprint Cup at Haydock on Saturday.The Curragh trainer fears her Group Three winner may not make the cut for the six-furlong feature, for which a maximum field of 17 can go to post.Her participation is in the balance as she was one of the lowest-rated of the 25 horses left in the Group One at the five-day confirmation stage. Collins is unlikely to know her fate until declaration time at 10am on Thursday by which stage Majestic Queen will have left her stables for the ferry crossing."She's on course for the race but she's in the ballot and I won't know until tomorrow whether she gets in or not," said Collins."It will have to be big fingers crossed. I've done a bit of ringing around and she'll be the first one out if the race is over-subscribed, so a few will have to come out for her to get in."She's well and she's in good form and if she gets in she'll travel."She'll be on her way to the ferry tomorrow when I find out if she's got in or not."If she doesn't get in at Haydock, she's in the Matron on Irish Champions weekend (at Leopardstown) and she's in a valuable handicap at the Curragh on the Sunday (the Irish Stallion Farms EBF "Bold Lad" Sprint Handicap)."I might also give her entry in the seven-furlong fillies Group Three (Sceptre Stakes) at the Doncaster St Leger meeting."
