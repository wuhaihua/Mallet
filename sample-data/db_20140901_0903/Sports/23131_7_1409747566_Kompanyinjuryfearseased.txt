			Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was unable to train with Belgium ahead of their friendly with Australia on Thursday night due to a suspected calf injury.The Belgium skipper was taken to hospital for a scan on Wednesday after being forced to miss training leading to fears he had suffered a recurrence of an old injury.But City fans will be relieved to discover that Kompany’s injury is not as bad as first thought after it was revealed he will begin light fitness work on Thursday.A tweet on the Belgian national team’s twitter feed read: “Good news coming about our captain! He'll start warm-ups tomorrow and we'll take it from there. Won't take any risks, though.”The 28-year-old has been plagued by persistent calf problems in recent seasons heightening fears that it may have flared up again."No @vincentkompany at training today," Belgium coach Marc Wilmots wrote on Twitter earlier in the day."He was taken to the hospital for a calf scan. We'll have to wait for the results."Belgium have since confirmed their line-up for tomorrow’s friendly in Liege will feature either Kompany or defender Laurent Ciman who plays for local side Standard Liege.Kompany who captained Belgium at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has represented his country on 62 occasions since making his debut in a 2-0 defeat by France in 2004.
