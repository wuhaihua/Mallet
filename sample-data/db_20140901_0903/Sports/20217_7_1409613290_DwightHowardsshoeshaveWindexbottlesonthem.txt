                    Dwight Howard showed off his new custom shoes from adidas on Instagram on Monday, featuring a spray bottle and the caption &quot;Windex man. Clean that glass.&quot;


Of course, a keen eye would point out that Windex -- and most glass cleaners, really -- are in clear bottles with blue liquid. What Howard&#39;s shoes actually have on them appears to be a bottle of Spray &#39;n Wash.

Maybe this makes more sense for Howard, who at age 28, has shown signs of decline. Last season for Houston, Howard totaled the lowest per-game production in rebounds since his rookie season and the least amount of blocks since 2005-06.

It&#39;s not as though he&#39;s not still one of the league&#39;s best defensive big men, but maybe the cleaning power of a laundry detergent is a better indicator of his resolve.
