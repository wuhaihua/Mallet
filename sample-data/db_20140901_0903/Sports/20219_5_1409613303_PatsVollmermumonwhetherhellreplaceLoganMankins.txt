Pats' Vollmer mum on whether he'll replace Logan Mankins Pats' Vollmer mum on whether he'll replace Logan Mankins Oct 21, 2012; Foxboro, Massachusetts, USA; New England Patriots tackle Sebastian Vollmer (76) during the fourth quarter against the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium. The New England Patriots won 29-26. Mandatory Credit: Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Patriots starting guard departed in a surprising trade. Logan Mankins leaves a big hole in the locker room and on the offensive line. Mankins was their best offensive lineman. So naturally, the question as to how the Pats will replace him goes to the next&nbsp;best offensive lineman, Sebastian Vollmer.&nbsp;It may be a serious issue, but Vollmer joked about his new role.  &ldquo;Hey, if they put me as wide receiver, you know I will be doing that, too,&rdquo; Vollmer said, via ESPN.com. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what they want me to do.&rdquo; If any lineman is moving to wide receiver, it&rsquo;s Dan Connolly, who busted off a 71-yard kickoff return back on Dec. 2010. Vollmer sounds like every Patriot ever asked a tough question. He&rsquo;s deferring to the judgment of his coaches. And he&rsquo;ll do as his coaches tell him. As for the departure of Mankins, he didn&rsquo;t joke about that. &ldquo;You never want to lose a guy, but it&rsquo;s the time of year where that happens,&rdquo; Vollmer said about the Mankins trade. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the only one; obviously he is a friend of a lot of us, played a lot of plays with the guy. But it&rsquo;s time to step up and go forward and play my game.&rdquo; The Patriots&rsquo; offensive line is deep. They&rsquo;ve got options in replacing Mankins. It could be moving Vollmer. It could also be promoting Marcus Cannon to starter. Knowing the Patriots, we won&rsquo;t know until Sept. 7 when the Pats open the season against the Dolphins.
