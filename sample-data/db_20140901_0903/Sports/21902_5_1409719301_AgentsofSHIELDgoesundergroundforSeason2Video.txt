Photo Credit: ABCEntertainment    We are now less than one month away from the premiere of the sophomore season of the hit ABC Original Series Marvel&rsquo;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  If you witnessed the events that played out in the final few episodes of Season One, then you are more than aware that the entire landscape has changed. Where S.H.I.E.L.D. was once very much out in the open and on the front lines of keeping people safe from the things that &ldquo;go bump in the night,&rdquo; now they must remain in the shadows. Agent Phil Coulson and his team will still be putting their lives on the line in order to make sure that the people of Earth are safe; it will just go unnoticed by many. As you may know by now, there are a number of new faces joining this new landscape when the new season starts. Xena: Warrior Princess&nbsp;star&nbsp;Lucy Lawless&nbsp;has been brought on as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Isabel Hartley. It has also announced that&nbsp;Simon Kassianides&nbsp;will be joining the cast as Bakshi. We also learned that Believe&nbsp;actor&nbsp;Kyle MacLachlan&nbsp;has been cast as Skye&rsquo;s father. Also, it was announced that Adrianne Palicki would be added to the cast of the series as Bobbi Morse a.k.a. Mocikingbird and that Teen Wolf&nbsp;actor Brian Patrick Wade would be joining the parade as Carl &ldquo;Crusher&rdquo; Creel. Some of these people will be joining the side of Agent, or should we say Director, Coulson and his team; others will be facing up against them. No matter which side you are on, this is sure to be a dark and twisted adventure that you won&rsquo;t want to miss a single moment of. While we wait for the new season to kick off, let&rsquo;s take a look at a new promo for the upcoming second season of Marvel&rsquo;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. &nbsp; Marvel&rsquo;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. premieres on Tuesday, September 23rd at 9:00 p.m. on ABC. &nbsp;
