Michael Irvin upset Briggs missed practice for restaurant opening Michael Irvin upset Briggs missed practice for restaurant opening  Lance Briggs was excused from practice Monday to attend the opening of his new restaurant, 'Double Nickel Smokehouse,' in his hometown of California.
Briggs, who was raised and attended high school in Elk Grove, said the restaurant is "very important to me," but it didn't sit well with a former Hall of Fame wide receiver.
With less than a week away until the Bears' season-opener against the Buffalo Bills, NFL analyst Michael Irvin voiced his concern with the Bears linebacker skipping practice.

Asked if he would have requested a day off for the restaurant opening to his former coach Jimmy Johnson, Irvin responded, via 670 The Score, "No, you would not have asked. You would have made sure that you scheduled your restaurant's opening day on a day that you had open, to open the restaurant. That's just what it is, so there's the difference right there. And you're right, that's the question. I don't know if they would have even asked fifteen years ago."
Irvin admitted missing practice for a personal matter is fine, but to a certain extent.
"I love that Trestman is all about family. That is a great thing. If you say you're having a baby, that's fine, go home," Irvin said, "but if you open a restaurant, that's within your control. That baby doesn't wait on you or no body else. That baby starts pushing and is ready to come, but a restaurant, I can tell you when those doors open."
