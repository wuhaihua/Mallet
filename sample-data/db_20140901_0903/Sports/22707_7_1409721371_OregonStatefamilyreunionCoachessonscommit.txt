Oregon State family reunion: Coaches' sons commit Oregon State family reunion: Coaches' sons commit 
           
                    Tuesday was family day at Oregon State.

Tres Tinkle, son of head coach Wayne Tinkle, and Stephen Thompson Jr., son of assistant Stephen Thompson, committed to the Beavers. Tinkle is a 6-7 forward, while Thompson is a 6-4 guard just like his dad, who starred at Syracuse.



And how will the boys handle playing for their fathers?

&quot;As the head coach&#39;s son, I know my dad will probably be the hardest on me but that&#39;s OK,&quot; Tres Tinkle told reporters, according to ESPN.com.

&quot;He has worked with me on my game his whole life and has made me into the player that I am today,&quot; ESPN.com quoted the younger Thompson as saying. &quot;Also, coach Tinkle is a great person and coach and I believe he will get the most out of my abilities.&quot;

OSU received a commitment from a third, non-family player, point guard Derrick Bruce.
