Who will Watson select for the Ryder Cup team? Who will Watson select for the Ryder Cup team? On Tuesday night, United States Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson will announce his three captain&#8217;s picks for this month&#8217;s competition at Gleneagles. Those players will join Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Patrick Reed, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Matt Kuchar on an American team that will enter the Ryder Cup a considerable underdog against a European squad that features golfers currently ranked Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 21, 26, 28, 33, 36 and 38 in the world.
Will Watson favor experience, picking players who already have competed in the most pressure-filled event in sports? Will he go with the hot hand, taking golfers who are peaking at the end of summer? Or will Watson surprise the world, like he did in 1993, when he selected 51-year-old Raymond Floyd with one of his selections? FTW examines the top contenders to join Watson&#8217;s Ryder Cup team and predicts which names will be called Tuesday evening.
Keegan Bradley

The 2011 PGA Championship winner went 3-0 in team matches with Phil Mickelson at the 2012 Ryder Cup, making him the anti-Tiger, if you will. He&#8217;s considered a shoo-in for Watson&#8217;s squad and did nothing in the FedEx Cup playoffs to change that.
Hunter Mahan

The 32-year-old made Watson&#8217;s job a little easier when he won the Barclay&#8217;s last week for his first victory of the season and sixth overall top-10. The match-play standout competed in the 2008 and 2010 Ryder Cups, playing eight matches and scoring 4.5 points. That&#8217;s a ratio of .563 points per match, which is higher than both Phil Mickelson (.447) and Tiger Woods (.439). Of active golfers with two or more Ryder Cup starts, only Zach Johnson (automatic), Matt Kuchar (automatic) and Dustin Johnson (withdrawn from consideration) have been better. The downside for Mahan: He&#8217;s missed the cut in five of his last 15 tournaments.
Chris Kirk

If Watson wants to go with the hottest hand, Kirk is the easy pick. He won the Deutsche Bank Championship over the holiday weekend, going toe-to-toe with Rory McIlroy in Monday&#8217;s final round. Had their round been scored as match play, Kirk would have won 4 and 3 against the world No. 1. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that Kirk had a fine season before his recent win.

This isn&#8217;t some late surge. It&#8217;s a solid player peaking at the right time.
Billy Horschel

The fiery Horschel was one shot off the Deutsche Bank lead when he stood over his second shot at the par-5 18th hole. He was just 212 yards away and had a 6-iron in his hands. Stick it close and the 27-year-old would have two putts to tie Kirk and send it to a playoff. What did he do? Horschel chunked his ball 150 yards into a hazard and finished with a bogey.
It was a pressure-packed situation, to be sure, but compared to the stakes of the Ryder Cup, that was like playing the windmill hole at your local Putt-Putt. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Horschel getting the nod after that. And anyway, the Ryder Cup uniforms wouldn&#8217;t allow Horschel to wear his trademark wild pants, which is a little like picking Superman but not letting him wear an &#8220;S&#8221; on his chest.
Brandt Snedeker

The 2012 rookie won just one point in three matches at the last Ryder Cup. He has experience, sure, just not the successful kind. Snedeker hasn&#8217;t been in great form this year and two missed cuts in his last two starts won&#8217;t help his case. Oh well; he and Watson will always have these Mastercard commercials.
 
Webb Simpson

Though the 2012 U.S. Open champion had a rough year at the majors (CUT, T45, CUT, CUT), he&#8217;s shown he can handle the nerves of major championships and international competition. A top-10 finish at the Deutsche Bank helped his cause, if we assume Watson was taking his decision down to the final minutes.
Predictions

Experience is overrated. If Ryder Cup experience were so valuable, Tiger Woods wouldn&#8217;t have a mediocre record, Jim Furyk would be an automatic pick and two of the four new U.S. players from 2012 wouldn&#8217;t have gone 3-1 in their matches.
Playing the hot hand is silly. The idea that a single round of golf on a Monday outside Boston proves Chris Kirk is a better fit for the Ryder Cup team than other players is preposterous. Golf is the most fickle of sports. Players can go from hot to cold on the same hole, let alone different tournaments across an ocean.
But as factors in selecting the captain&#8217;s picks, experience and recent success are pretty much all Watson has to go on. His European counterpart, Paul McGinley, took a little of both, going with the experienced Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood, with the recently hot Stephen Gallacher as his third pick.
The good news for Watson is he really can&#8217;t go wrong. His team is an underdog either way. Though there are no home run picks, there aren&#8217;t many whiffs either. I say he goes with experience and a proven ability to handle pressure situations, taking Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson.
