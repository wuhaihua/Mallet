                    Notre Dame visits Michigan on Saturday in the 42nd meeting between the two schools. The two teams have played every season since 2002, but are suspending the series through at least 2019.

Here&rsquo;s a look at the 10 most memorable games between the two:

1989: No. 1 Notre Dame 24, No. 2 Michigan 19

Notre Dame took a 14-6 lead to start the second half when Raghib Ismail returned a kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown. Michigan pulled within five points with 12:46 left behind Elvis Grbac, who replaced an injured Michael Taylor. &ldquo;The Rocket&rdquo; struck again, however, with a 92-yard touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff to help seal the win for the Irish. &nbsp;



1991: No. 3 Michigan 24, No. 7 Notre Dame 14

Michigan clung to a 17-14 lead and faced a fourth-and-1 early in the fourth quarter. Coach Gary Moeller opted to go for it, and one of college football&rsquo;s iconic plays followed. Elvis Grbac threw a touchdown pass to Desmond Howard &mdash; forever known as &ldquo;The Catch&rdquo; &mdash; which helped launch a Heisman Trophy season for Howard.



1943: No. 1 Notre Dame 35, No. 2 Michigan 12

The top-ranked Irish were led by Frank Leahy and Heisman Trophy winner Angelo Bertelli. Michigan had Elroy &ldquo;Crazy Legs&rdquo; Hirsch. A record crowd at Michigan Stadium watched Bertelli dominate the game. Notre Dame won the AP national championship.



2011: Michigan 35, Notre Dame 31

Notre Dame held a 24-7 lead in the first night game in Michigan Stadium heading into the fourth quarter, but that&rsquo;s when the fireworks started. Three TDs were scored in the final 1:12, and Denard Robinson led a miracle drive with a 16-yard TD pass to Roy Roundtree with two seconds remaining. Robinson finished with 446 total yards and five total TDs.

1986: No. 3 Michigan 26, Notre Dame 24

In Lou Holtz&rsquo;s first game as Notre Dame&rsquo;s coach, the Irish almost upset the Wolverines. Jim Harbaugh rallied the Wolverines, however, and Notre Dame kicker John Carney missed a 45-yard field goal as time expired. The Irish, however, moved up to No. 20 in the AP Poll despite the loss.

Notre Dame&rsquo;s Jimmy Clausen and Michigan&rsquo;s Tate Forcier put on a show, and the teams combined for 28 points in the fourth quarter. Forcier&rsquo;s five-yard touchdown pass to Greg Mathews with 11 seconds remaining sealed the win for the Wolverines.
