Following the arc of Mallett's pro career Following the arc of Mallett's pro career August 31, 2014, 2:45 pm How did we get here? After an uneventful three-year stay in New England, Ryan Mallett -- a third-round selection in the 2011 draft -- has been flipped to the Texans for a conditional seventh-rounder.
That kind of compensation for the former middle-round pick gives an idea of how those around the league perceive Mallett's value. But what happened between 2011 and 2014 that his value could have dropped in such a fashion? Considering Mallett was the backup to Tom Brady, who hasn't missed a meaningful snap since he suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2008, Mallett hasn't had many chances to prove himself. If anything, one would think three years under the tutelage of Brady and Bill Belichick may have actually improved Mallett's value. 
Clearly that wasn't the case. Let's delve into why.
COLLEGE CAREERMallett was afforded the opportunity to develop in his first professional season; he essentially had a red-shirt year. Brian Hoyer had been Brady's back up since 2009 when he won the job as an undrafted free agent, and he held that position through Mallett's rookie season. People forget that Mallett impressed early in preseason game action during his first year. Though he may not have been as effective as rookie Jimmy Garoppolo was through his first preseason this summer, Mallett was close. He completed 30-of-47 passes (64 percent) through his first three preseason games for 300 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The shine wore off quickly, however. In preseason game No. 4, he went 6-for-16 and was sacked five times.He did not appear in any regular season games.2012 SEASONDespite a training-camp invite to Tim Tebow, Mallett had an easy time holding onto his spot as New England's primary backup. Tebow was released at the end of camp after Mallett went 42-for-76 for 447 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Mallett still appeared to struggle with his touch, and he didn't improve much in terms of his in-game accuracy, but he was the best the Patriots had, and he kept his job.2014 SEASONMallett's first real test for the backup role did not go smoothly.
The Patriots took Garoppolo in the second round of the 2014 draft. All of a sudden they had not only a potential future successor to Brady, they had a potential immediate replacement for Mallett. Garoppolo's start to training camp was brutal, which made it seem as though the Patriots would have to select three quarterbacks for their 53-man roster because Garoppolo simply wasn't ready to handle backup duties. That changed when Garoppolo showed poise and accuracy in preseason game No. 1 against the Redskins that he hadn't shown to that point in training camp. From that point on, Garoppolo displayed good command in the huddle and a touch that Mallett had not exhibited in almost four years as a pro. At points during training camp, Mallett dealt with what appeared to be a nagging knee injury that he seemed to suffer initially during spring workouts. Mallett insisted he didn't re-aggravate the injury sliding to the turf against the Redskins, but he missed two training camp practices following the game, affording Garoppolo more practice repetitions. As Garoppolo improved throughout the summer, Mallett appeared stuck in neutral. His reps in preseason games became more and more limited -- whether to give Garoppolo some experience or whether to keep Mallett healthy in case an attractive trade proposal emerged for his services -- and he finished three contests (not playing in the fourth) 14-for-26 with one touchdown passing, one touchdown rushing and no interceptions. QUICK TAKE That's how a third-round pick becomes a conditional seventh.  How did we get here?
