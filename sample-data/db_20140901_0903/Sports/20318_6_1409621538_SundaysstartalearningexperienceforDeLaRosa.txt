Sunday's start a learning experience for De La Rosa Sunday's start a learning experience for De La Rosa September 1, 2014, 8:30 pm ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - For young starting pitchers making their way in the big leagues, every outing is a learning experience and there are often good developments and bad each time out.
So it was with Rubby De La Rosa Sunday, who allowed three runs on six hits over 5 1/3 innings.
First the good: after experiencing issues with his command lately and walking there or more batters in four of his five previous starts, De La Rosa's command was vastly improved with no walks issued.
"I tried to keep my ball over home plate," said De La Rosa.
"He was much better," said John Farrell. "Even though he didn't back off his velocity, I thought his direction through  home plate and his target was more consistent. It was an impressive three-pitch mix for him.
"He was powerful. He had better secondary stuff than last time out. He made a number of quality pitches but there were so many foul balls - which is a product of very good stuff - ran the pitch count up. We're not at the point where we're looking to extend him too far.
"But I thought he kept good composure. I thought he repeated his delivery well. It was a solid 5 1/3 innings of work today."
Now the bad: after the Sox got him an early lead in the top of the third, he gave the lead back and then some when he allowed three runs in the bottom of the same inning.
"Ideally," allowed Farrell, "(you'd like) a zero following the times we score. It continues to be a point of emphasis with young pitchers, young starters in particular."
"I was trying to do the same things I was doing in the first and second innings," said De La Rosa.
But without the same results.  ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - For young starting pitchers making their way in the big leagues, every outing is a learning experience and there are often good developments and bad each time out.
