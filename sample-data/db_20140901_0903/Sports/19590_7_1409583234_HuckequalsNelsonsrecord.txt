			German cruiserweight Marco Huck defeated Mirko Larghetti of Italy on a unanimous points decision in Halle to retain his WBO belt for a record-equalling 13th time.The judges scored the fight 116-112, 116-112, 118-110 in favour of the defending champion, who was really only troubled in the seventh and eighth rounds.Some harsh words from trainer Ulli Wegner at the end of the eighth sparked Huck back into life and Larghetti, who went into the bout unbeaten after 21 fights, was in danger of being knocked out by the 11th round.Huck then went for it in the final round, which ended with a flurry of punches as the bell was ringing to leave the challenger on the canvas."I respect how my opponent fought. But I deserved to win," said Huck.The Serbian-born Huck improved his record to 38-2-1 with the win and equalled the record held by Britain's Johnny Nelson, who was at ringside, for the most successful title defences in the cruiserweight division.
