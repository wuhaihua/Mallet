Vasquez-USA TODAY SportsDaily Sports Picks    The month of September is off to a good start for most Streak for the Cash entries after a mostly chalky Monday of picks. &nbsp;As we head back to work today, let&rsquo;s keep the green picks rolling in with today&rsquo;s 20-pick board. &nbsp;The daytime board today is made up of a mixture of the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the continuing U.S. Open. &nbsp;Tonight, we have Major League Baseball, more tennis, and a bit game three from the WNBA Western Conference Playoffs. &nbsp;Hopefully, I can continue my hot start to the month and help us all get more wins today. Here are my picks for each option&nbsp;today with my confidence level in each selection on a scale of 1-10: 9/2 Streak Picks 7:30-&nbsp;Angola:&nbsp;4 Aug 31, 2014; New York, NY, USA; Belinda Bencic (SUI) reacts during her match against Jelena Jankovic (SRB) on day seven of the 2014 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
