Wozniacki suddenly in Open driver's seat Wozniacki suddenly in Open driver's seat Ever since Caroline Wozniacki burst onto the world scene with an unexpected run to the finals of the 2009 U.S. Open, she&#8217;s been described as a &#8220;defensive&#8221; player, a barely-veiled insult about her tentative play. On Sunday, being defensive never looked so good.
Exhibiting remarkable range and an ability to stay in points that appeared long finished, the defensive (in a good way), Wozniacki upset No. 5 seed Maria Sharapova, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. At no time was that more evident than on a crucial break point at 2-1 in the third set when Sharapova had three opportunities to end the point, but could never dispatch Wozniacki, who ran back and forth on the baseline and eventually stabbed a defensive shot that led a Sharapova unforced error. Afterward, Wozniacki uncharacteristically raised up her arms and commanded the crowd to get on their feet. From then on, the fans at Arthur Ashe stadium were firmly Team Caro.

Wozniacki&#8217;s training for the upcoming New York City Marathon appeared to come in handy during the match, as she was far fresher during the three-setter played in stifling summer conditions. That came as a bit of a surprise, as many thought marathon conditioning wouldn&#8217;t be conducive to Wozniacki&#8217;s tennis conditioning. The stamina needed to run 26.2 miles isn&#8217;t the same that&#8217;s needed to play a two-and-a-half hour match punctuated with quick bursts of speed.

Wozniacki also showed more fire power in between points too. At the start of the third set, she complained to the chair umpire about Sharapova&#8217;s stall tactics. &#8220;She takes one minute before first serve and then another minute before second serve,&#8221; Wozniacki complained. The former world No. 1 also shot Sharapova some stares after points during which the Russian&#8217;s famed shrieks seemed to get louder. No player in tennis is more intimidating in a third set than Maria Sharapova. On Sunday, Wozniacki barely blinked.

The win gets Wozniacki to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her past 11 appearances. She&#8217;ll be favored against No. 13 Sara Errani and should be the favorite against any potential semifinal opponent too, as the only higher seed in her half of the draw is No. 9 Jelena Jankovic. Suddenly, Caroline Wozniacki is the favorite to make it back to her second U.S. Open final.
If she gets that far, Wozniacki is one of the few players left in the draw who could have a legitimate chance to upset Serena Williams when Serena isn&#8217;t beating herself. Wozniacki pushed Williams to three sets in each of their two hard-court matches this summer and both times came within a few points of swinging momentum in the third set. To even suggest that Wozniacki could hang with Williams in a Grand Slam final would have been unimaginable as recently as five months ago.

Even when Wozniacki was No. 1 in the world, most doubted she could ever win a Grand Slam. She didn&#8217;t create enough opportunities to win seven matches in two weeks against different styles. When Wozniacki later stumbled out of the top 10, people wondered whether she&#8217;d ever regain her old form. Confidence is a hard thing to regain in a sport such as tennis.
The second question is answered. The first will linger until she hoists a trophy or retires. But given her uptick in play and a decimated draw, Caroline Wozniacki will have one of her best chances over the next week in New York.
