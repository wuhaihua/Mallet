			Newcastle United midfielder Jack Colback will be England boss Roy Hodgson's only absentee for Wednesday’s friendly against Norway at Wembley.Hodgson has revealed the new England recruit will miss the game due to an injury, which he has been unable to recover from in time for the fixture.Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Hodgson confirmed: “All but one of the squad are fit. Jack Colback is out of the game tomorrow.“We were hoping he would recover, but it’s looking like it’s come a day too soon for him."Hodgson has also given first call-ups to Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, Tottenham left-back Danny Rose and Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph for the clash, which comes ahead of the European qualifier against Switzerland on September 9.Although he stopped short of naming his first XI, Hodgson revealed that no debutants would be in the starting line-up.“It will be a young one. It will contain some interesting talents and has enormous potential,” Hodgson said.“There will be no-one making their debut from the start, but there will be on or two players who won’t have had many starts.”Wednesday's game is expected to draw a record low attendance at Wembley following England's miserable showing at the World Cup this year.
