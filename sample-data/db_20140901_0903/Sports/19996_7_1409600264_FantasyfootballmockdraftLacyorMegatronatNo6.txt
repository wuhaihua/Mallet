                    Eddie Lacy or Calvin Johnson at No. 6?&nbsp;

That&rsquo;s the choice I chewed fingernails on for a week before our Experts League Draft last week. Do I take the second-year Green Bay running back, the very man I named my Honda Pilot after last season? Or do I take the game&rsquo;s best receiver, who has ranked in the top three at the position the last three years?&nbsp;

So I stared at the 13-time World Champion Packers banner in my living room, took a deep breath and ...&nbsp;

 This is a three-wide league, so Megatron is the pick. It also will be interesting to see Lacy owners panic after the Packers play the Seahawks and Jets in the first two weeks.&nbsp;

 Wanted to take Giovani Bernard in the second round, but Rodgers fell to the back half of the second round. I don&rsquo;t even need to look at the banner.&nbsp;

 Gore is old, but he still averages close to 1,200 yards the last three seasons with Jim Harbaugh. Give me the between-the-tackles back.&nbsp;

This is proof that I show my cards at all time. I drafted Gore and Johnson in our Experts Mock Draft on Aug. 5. These are my guys.&nbsp;

 Cameron and Jason Witten are the bridge between the elite tight ends and the tight ends nobody should start every week. Cameron had 19 catches, 193 yards and four TDs in those three games with Brian Hoyer last season.&nbsp;

 This is the key to this draft. I don&rsquo;t need Watkins to be a WR1. I&rsquo;ll take WR2 production, and I&rsquo;ll buy him a flak jacket if necessary.&nbsp;

 This is another reach, but Hyde is Gore insurance, and given Gore&rsquo;s age that&rsquo;s mandatory at this stage. With Watkins and Hyde, I have the two best rookies in the draft.&nbsp;

&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to need a 49ers hat for this season.&nbsp;

&nbsp;A starting back in the ninth round. Thomas remains a value pick.&nbsp;

. Bowe wouldn&rsquo;t fall this low without a one-game suspension, and he&rsquo;s an insurance policy for Watkins.

 Go ahead and take Jonathan Stewart over Williams. Be my guest. Williams has almost twice as much rushing yards and 10 more rushing TDs the last three years.&nbsp;

Total rescue mission for Austin, who should get more targets &ndash; even if they come from Shaun Hill.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a good pick. The 49ers have too many questions on defense, and I might be forced to try one-week rentals until those are answered.&nbsp;

 Colleague Matt Lutovsky asks if Palmer comes with a -2 handicap. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell Matt that Palmer is one of just nine QBs who averaged at least 4,000 yards passing the past two seasons.&nbsp;

 Mason&rsquo;s pass-blocking dropped him off draft boards, but he&rsquo;ll get carries at some point. This is dirt cheap for a rookie with Mason&rsquo;s ability.&nbsp;

 Tucker is 30-of-35 from 40 yards or more, including 10-of-11 from 50 yards or more. Good enough for me.&nbsp;

 Thompkins averaged 14.6 yards per catch as a rookie. Just catch the ball.
