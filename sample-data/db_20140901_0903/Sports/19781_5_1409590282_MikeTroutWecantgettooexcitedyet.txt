Mike Trout: 'We can't get too excited yet' Mike Trout: 'We can't get too excited yet' Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsMLB    The Los Angeles Angels have officially taken over the mantle for scariest team in baseball. It was held for most of the season by their rivals within the division, the Oakland Athletics, but with an authoritative sweep this weekend over those same A&rsquo;s, the Angels look like the team to beat at the present moment.  Knowing how difficult it can be to stay at the top and knowing how much season is left, the Angels are not ready to get ahead of themselves. That starts with the mindset of star outfielder Mike Trout and manager Mike Scioscia, as passed along by Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a long way to go. I know a lot of people are counting down. Not us,&rdquo; said Manager Mike Scioscia. Added outfielder Mike Trout: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get too excited yet.&rdquo; Sitting at 83-53, the Angels are five games up on the A&rsquo;s with 26 games left on the schedule. Those are actually fairly tall odds to overcome for Oakland, though we know better by now than to think that such a thing cannot happen over the course of a month of regular season baseball. There are three games left on the schedule between the A&rsquo;s and the Angels, set for the final week of the season at the Oakland Coliseum. From the Angels&rsquo; perspective, they would love to have things out of reach before that series ever starts. From Oakland&rsquo;s perspective, they would like to be within striking distance so as to make their final push for the division.
