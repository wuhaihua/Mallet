Wins still the final measures but Emery drafts setting Bears foundation Wins still the final measures but Emery drafts setting Bears foundation  General manager Phil Emery has been under some scrutiny for his first (2012), which has Pro Bowl wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and possibly linebacker Shea McClellin to show for personnel’s efforts. Whether a Pro Bowl wide receiver and average (until proved otherwise) linebacker constitutes a decent draft is a talk topic.
On the other hand, all eight 2014 draft choices are among the 11 rookies placed on the 53-man roster. And all six of the 2013 selections were and still are on the roster.


The roster is in balance with 25 offensive players, 25 defensive players and three specialists. The presence of only eight offensive linemen, particularly with two having injury issues (Jordan Mills, foot; Brian de la Puente, knee) is expected to change this week when the Bears can place wide receiver Marquess Wilson on injured reserve, taking the wideout number from six to five, and bumping the O-line count up by one.
The 2013 season was undone in large part because of the Bears not having enough depth on the defensive line, per GM Phil Emery’s own assessment, fair or not. The Bears did not have their starting five in place all preseason and are unlikely to risk a high-expectation season on a position group that thin.
