			Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has refused to rule out a move for a new striker before the close of the transfer window.The Gunners have been tipped to make a late foray into the transfer market to bring in a new forward following the injury to Olivier Giroud, which is set to sideline the striker until January.Wenger was asked if he was planning to make a move for a new striker before Monday's 11pm deadline and he admits he remains open to the possibility of bringing more new faces."Look, the decision is not to make, it's to find personnel. We are open, we work on it, but let's not fool ourselves. Man City lost against Stoke and had strikers, it's not just about buying one player."We want to and we are open to it. The pressure to buy is always there, we have to live with that, we try our best."Wenger was remaining coy on his side's reported interest in Loic Remy prior to the striker's move to Chelsea, but admits Arsenal remain active in the transfer market as we draw ever closer to Monday's deadline."I don't want to speak about individual cases. We are very active," added Wenger.Wenger felt his side did not create enough going forward as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Leicester at the King Power Stadium.Arsenal had 24 attempts at goal, but only had Alexis Sanchez's goal to show for their efforts with Leo Ulloa earning Leicester a deserved point and Wenger had no complaints with the result."(It was) tough, tough, we could have maybe got the goal and after that we didn't create enough today," noted Wenger. "They fought very hard."
