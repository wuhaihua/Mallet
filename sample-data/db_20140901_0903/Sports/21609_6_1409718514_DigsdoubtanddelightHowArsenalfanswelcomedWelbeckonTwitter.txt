Digs, doubt and delight: How Arsenal fans welcomed Welbeck on Twitter Digs, doubt and delight: How Arsenal fans welcomed Welbeck on Twitter 
										
		Despite Arsene Wenger saying that buying a forward was not what you do if you stop winning, he fell to the temptation of signing Danny Welbeck when Manchester United completed a deal for Radamel Falcao. 

The deal is reported to have cost Arsenal 16 million pounds &mdash; the same amount Liverpool paid AC Milan for Mario Balotelli. Aside from the fact that Welbeck is through and through Manchester United &mdash; some Arsenal fans doubted their new striker's ability, some called the price atrocious and some were absolutely chuffed to bits.
Here are the pick of the tweets as reactions poured in after Arsenal's late confirmation that they had signed the England international.
