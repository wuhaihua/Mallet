U.S. Open 2014: Roger Federer reaches quarterfinals U.S. Open 2014: Roger Federer reaches quarterfinals 
           
                    Roger Federer&#39;s quest for major championship No. 18 continues.

Federer is through to men&#39;s quarterfinals of the 2014 U.S. Open after dispatching No. 17 Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.



Next up is Gael Monfils, the 20th seed, who upset No. 7 Grigor Dimitrov earlier Tuesday.

Aside from a brief first-set blip, Federer was rather dominant in reaching the Open quarterfinals for the 10th time in 11 years.

Federer was broken only once, part of a three-game run for Bautista Agut that took the score from 5-1 to 5-4 in the first set . But Federer had no trouble the second time he tried to serve out that set, which he ended with a pair of aces.

Moving well and winning the point on 35 of 52 trips to the net, the second-seeded Federer needed less than two hours to improve to 25-1 in night matches at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

A year ago, Federer lost in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows.
