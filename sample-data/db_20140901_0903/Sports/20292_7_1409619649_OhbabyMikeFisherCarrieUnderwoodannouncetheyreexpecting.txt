Underwood is due next spring, according to her publicist.

Boy or girl? Don&#39;t know. But Fisher&nbsp;has started &nbsp;the naming process (sort of).


We haven&#39;t picked names yet but it&#39;s looking like Fly is gonna fly. #boyorgirl #flyfisher

Fisher will have a litle&nbsp;time to help Underwood in the early stages:&nbsp;He&#39;s rehabbing a ruptured left Achilles&#39; and is not expected to be ready for the start of the NHL season.
