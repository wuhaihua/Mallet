                    Real Madrid is on the verge of completing a season-long loan deal for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez.

Los Blancos had considered moving for both Radamel Falcao of Monaco and Manchester City&rsquo;s Alvaro Negredo but have decided that the Mexican - who has been told that he is free to leave Old Trafford - represents the best option.

Hernandez is seen as a player who can add an extra goal threat but one who will not compromise the standing of the club&rsquo;s biggest stars, with Karim Benzema currently first-choice center forward.

The 26-year-old has never been able to nail down a consistent starting role with the Red Devils since his move from Guadalajara in the summer of 2010 and was keen to seek first-team football elsewhere.

He sees Madrid as the ideal opportunity to prove himself, feeling that he was not given sufficient opportunities to impress at Old Trafford.

A season&#39;s loan has been agreed between the two clubs, with only personal terms left to finalize before the move is officially announced.
