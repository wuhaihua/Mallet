                    Sporting News MLB writers Jesse Spector and Ryan Fagan trade emails from time to time about compelling topics in the world of baseball. This week, they draft their perfect 2014 four-man playoff rotations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 My first pick&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have the best track record in the postseason (4.23 career ERA).&nbsp;I&rsquo;m aware of that.&nbsp;

The last time he made a playoff start (against the Cardinals in the 2013 NLCS), in fact, he faced 24 batters in four-plus innings and retired only 12. Ten of the 24 produced hits, two walked and seven eventually scored.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m aware of that, too.

But if I&rsquo;m given the first choice for building a 2014 playoff rotation, I&rsquo;m going with Clayton Kershaw. The left-hander has been dominating this season, and I&rsquo;m OK rolling the dice with an ace who is striking out 8.76 batters for every one he walks this year.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;I&#39;ll take this year&#39;s other Cy Young shoo-in, Felix Hernandez. Will the Mariners even get past the wild-card game? I don&#39;t know, but what I do know is that one of the best pitchers of his generation has been waiting a lifetime to take the mound in a game that really and truly matters, and when it comes to the October atmosphere of knowing you&#39;re not going to get a ton of run support, I direct your attention to a man who is well accustomed to that, being backed up by the Seattle lineup.&nbsp;

Plus, Lloyd McClendon has been careful all year to limit Hernandez&#39;s innings. He should be ready to let loose when it matters most.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;With my second choice, I&rsquo;m gonna give a nod to past playoff performance. Yeah, I know, that kind of goes against my first-pick theory, but I&rsquo;m aware of that. My next pick has made 11 career playoff starts and has a 1.97 ERA in those contests, including a 0.43 ERA in three career World Series start.

And Jon Lester is having a pretty good 2014, too.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;The numbers in the playoffs aren&#39;t quite as sparkling, and he lost both of his duels with Lester last year, but a 2.53 ERA in 67.2 career playoff innings is nothing to sneeze at, and Adam Wainwright is having another great season, so I&#39;ll gladly have him in my playoff rotation.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;Can I sign Pedro Martinez now and give him a month to prepare? Because I still believe he could be a star on the big stage. If not, I&rsquo;m going to pick my third lefty, Chris Sale.&nbsp;

He has zero playoff experience, but that stuff is just nasty. He&rsquo;s my No. 3.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;Wait, we can take guys who aren&#39;t even sniffing the playoffs? That doesn&#39;t change my first two picks, but for my Game 3 starter, it sure does. Cole Hamels should be pitching for a playoff team right now anyway. It&#39;s only because of Ruben Amaro Jr.&#39;s 30th-ranked general managering that he&#39;s not. In this fantasy, he is. For me.&nbsp;

 &nbsp;Heck yeah. If we&rsquo;re stealing starters, any rotation is fair game. I pretty much flipped a coin between Sale and Hamels for my previous pick (with Bumgarner in the mix, too).

For this last one, I&rsquo;m going with another playoff newbie, Corey Kluber. He&rsquo;s having an amazing season for Cleveland, one that one could argue is Cy Young worthy, even in this amazing year of King Felix. Would love to see him pitch an actual playoff game this year, but that&rsquo;s not happening, so I&rsquo;ll have to settle for picking him here.&nbsp;

 If Bumgarner was in the mix, why didn&#39;t you take him? Wait, let me not ask questions, and just make that wrong into my right before you realize what you&#39;ve done. I like Kluber a lot, but I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;s a one-year Cleveland wonder. See also: Masterson, Justin and Jimenez, Ubaldo. Call me a skeptic. I&#39;ll live with another awesome lefty in my rotation.&nbsp;
