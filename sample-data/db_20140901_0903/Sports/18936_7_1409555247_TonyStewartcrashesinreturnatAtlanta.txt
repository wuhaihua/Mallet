                    Tony Stewart&#39;s dramatic return to racing ended just past halfway Sunday night in the Oral-B 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

Stewart, who had just been lapped, slammed the wall on Lap 172, heavily damaging his car. Stewart drove his car straight to the garage.

&quot;Sorry, guys, you deserved better,&quot; he told his team over his team radio.
