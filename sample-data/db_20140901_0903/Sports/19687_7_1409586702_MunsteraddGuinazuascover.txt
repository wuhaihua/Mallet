			Munster have signed Argentina hooker Eusebio Guinazu on a four-month deal.Guinazu, who has 36 international caps, has joined the Guinness PRO12 side to add depth to their squad in the wake of Mike Sherry having surgery on his shoulder.The 32-year-old joins Munster after two seasons at Bath - he has also had stints at Biarritz, Toulouse and the Stormers."We need to hit the ground running this season and to do this we need to have a full complement of players available to us," said Munster head coach Anthony Foley."We have short-term setbacks with Niall Scannell rehabbing from wrist injury and Damien Varley managing a foot injury, but with Sherry ruled out until next year it is great that we can call on the services of an experienced, versatile player such as Eusebio."His availability will certainly help us get through the opening period of the season."
