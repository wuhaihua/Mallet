Sidney Crosby arrest reports are a 'blatant lie' Sidney Crosby arrest reports are a 'blatant lie' Jun 24, 2014; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Pittsburg Penguins captain Sidney Crosby holds the Hart Trophy while posing with the Ted Lindsay Award and the Art Ross Trophy after winning the three titles during the 2014 NHL Awards ceremony at Wynn Las Vegas. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY SportsNHL    Reports surfaced early Wednesday morning that Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby was arrested in Ottawa. The report was initially passed along by the Ottawa Sun, who claimed Crosby was taken for &ldquo;fingerprints and a mugshot.&rdquo;  The paper offered very little information on the arrest other than the fact that Crosby was allegedly driving a rented Porsche, and now we now why. According to the Ottawa Police Department, the reports of Crosby being arrested are a &ldquo;blatant lie.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an out and out blatant lie,&rdquo; Sergeant Steven Hodgson told 1310News in Ottawa. &ldquo;As far as I know, somebody is pulling something here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hodgson went on to say that his department had no dealings with Crosby. In fact, while the Ottawa Sun is out reporting Crosby was in Ottawa being arrested, he was actually out in Colorado doing what professionals do and preparing for the upcoming NHL season. Penguins confirm, Crosby is in Vail, Colorado training this week. &mdash; Darren Dreger (@DarrenDreger) September 3, 2014 The Ottawa Sun has since pulled their story. Crosby story has been pulled from Ottawa Sun&rsquo;s website. pic.twitter.com/atN8OC14mG &mdash; Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) September 3, 2014 Hey, at least the Ottawa Sun didn&rsquo;t go claiming that Sidney Crosby injured both of his ankles while jumping off of a balcony to save a drowning nephew. A manufactured report of that nature would just be ridiculous, now wouldn&rsquo;t it?
