    NEW YORK (AP)  Anthony Recker snapped a sixth-inning tie with a three-run homer in a rare start, and the New York Mets held off the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 Sunday to avoid dropping into last place.


    Wilmer Flores had three hits and made two sparkling defensive plays at shortstop in the final two innings to help New York hang on. By taking two of three in the weekend series, the Mets kept Philadelphia in the NL East cellar.


    Dillon Gee pitched effectively into the seventh inning, and New York finished 13-6 against the Phillies this season.


    Recker, who had not played since Aug. 19 in Oakland, lined the first pitch he saw from A.J. Burnett in the sixth into the left-field seats to give the Mets a 5-2 lead.  The home run was only his third hit since the All-Star break.
