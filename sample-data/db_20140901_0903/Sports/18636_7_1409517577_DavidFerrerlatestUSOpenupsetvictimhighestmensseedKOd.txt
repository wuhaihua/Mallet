                    David Ferrer won&#39;t win the U.S. Open; his loss Sunday at Flushing Meadows made sure of that.

Seeded No. 4 in a men&#39;s draw heretofore devoid of upsets, Ferrer became to first top player knocked out of the Open.

The upset was done by 26th-seeded Gilles Simon, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-3.

It was a stunning results, noted the New York Times, because Ferrer dominated previous matches against Simon. &quot;Destroyed&quot; was the term Simon used.

Simon moves on to play the winner of the match between 14th-seeded Marin Cilic and 18th-seeded Kevin Anderson.

The women&#39;s draw has been in upheaval all week, losing all but four of the top 10 players. Earlier, 13th-seeded Sara Errani used steady shots and her soft serve to reach the quarterfinals, beating 32-year-old qualifier Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-3, 2-6, 6-0. Lucic-Baroni had KO&#39;d No. 2 seed Simona Halep.

Errani next plays fifth-seeded Maria Sharapova or 10th-seeded Caroline Wozniacki, a match that promises to add to the wreckage of among the top-seeded women. Half the top 10 seeds were all gone before the end of Week 1. Of the top eight women, No. 1 Serena Williams, Sharapova and No. 7 Eugenie Bouchard remained.

Second-seeded Roger Federer played later against Spaniard Marcel Granollers and No. 6 Tomas Berdych played Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili.

In a night match at Arthur Ashe Stadium, No. 7-seeded Grigor Dimitrov faces 56th-ranked David Goffin of Belgium, who since losing to Andy Murray in the first round at Wimbledon has gone 27-1, mostly in smaller tournaments.
