			Andrew Balding is in no rush to decide on the next target for his smart juvenile Elm Park.The son of Phoenix Reach, who was also trained by Balding and was third in the Ladbrokes St Leger, ran out a very impressive winner of the Listed Stonehenge Stakes at Salisbury on Friday.He holds an entry in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster next month and given he races in the famous colours of Mill Reef (Kingsclere Racing Club) he is likely to develop a big following."We're in no rush to run him back, we'll just let the dust settle," said Balding."We've always thought he was pretty nice and it was nice to see him go and do it like that."You couldn't fail to be impressed with the way he did it, but what the form is worth I don't know."The manner he did it was very pleasing and we'll just see how he is."He won't be running before the end of September, anyway."
