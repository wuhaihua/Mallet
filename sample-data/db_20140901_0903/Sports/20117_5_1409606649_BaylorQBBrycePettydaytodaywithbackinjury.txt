Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty is day-to-day with a back injury suffered in the Bears season opening win against SMU.  If you tuned in late to the Baylor game against SMU on Sunday evening, you may have missed the reigning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year as Petty was removed from the game at halftime for what was believed to be as a result of the 31-0 score. However an MRI on Monday revealed Petty has two cracked bones in the transfer processes of his back, according to Dennis Dodds of CBSSports.com. Petty admits he is in pain but expects to play this weekend against Northwestern State. The injury will not require surgery and is expected to heal on its own according to Dodds&rsquo; report. The injury occurred when Petty took a shot on his first run in the first quarter that went for 16 yards, but head coach Art Briles kept him in the game because &ldquo;he needed the reps&rdquo; and it was believed to be a bruise and &ldquo;nothing serious.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bummed out because it&rsquo;s never fun being hurt,&rdquo; Petty said. &ldquo;Bummed out because I just watched tape and everything is off. You never want to make any excuses. When you&rsquo;re throwing and I can&rsquo;t torque [it's frustrating]. Every time I went to throw it would jolt. It felt like somebody was punching me in my side.&rdquo; He says he can&rsquo;t sit or walk right but will try to practice on Tuesday. Petty finished with 161 yards passing and two touchdowns and also added a five-yard touchdown run to finish with 21 yards on two carries.
