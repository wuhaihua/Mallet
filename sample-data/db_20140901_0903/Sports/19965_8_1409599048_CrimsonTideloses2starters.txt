                        TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Alabama learned a lot from its         season-opening win over West Virginia on Saturday, but it came at a cost as the         Crimson Tide lost a pair of veteran starters for a significant amount of time.

Jarrick Williams, a senior defensive back with 10 career starts, will miss four weeks with a fractured foot, and         DeAndrew White, another senior who starts at wide receiver, will miss two weeks with a shoulder injury, coach Nick Saban announced on Monday.





     

Who will be throwing the football to White's replacement at receiver, though, remains unclear.

Saban committed to playing both         Blake Sims and         Jake Coker against         Florida AtlanticÂ on Saturday, but the coach wouldn't say how the two would share reps.

"When I figure it out, I won't tell you," Saban said with a smile.

Sims started and played all but a few snaps against West Virginia, completing roughly 73 percent of his pass attempts. Coker came on late, handing the ball off only a few times before the game ended.

"I still don't hesitate to say there's a quarterback competition," Saban said.

Saban said that both         Geno Smith and         Maurice Smith are the options to start in place of Williams at the 'star' position.

Though         Robert Foster is listed on the depth chart as White's backup at the 'Z' receiver position, junior         Chris Black was the one who took his spot on offense against West Virginia.
