Patriots got a good look at Quarles in preseason Patriots got a good look at Quarles in preseason September 1, 2014, 11:15 pm FOXBORO -- Ever since the Patriots lost two of their defensive linemen -- Chris Jones (ankle) and Sealver Siliga (wrist) -- to injury early in training camp, they've moved to add depth to that position group.
They traded for Jerel Worthy and Ben Bass to help fill the back-end of the depth chart, but neither of those players were deemed good fits for the 53-man roster. On Sunday, the Patriots picked up two more players to bolster the group: Kelcy Quarles and Bruce Gaston. 
Quarles is a rookie out of South Carolina who racked up 9.5 sacks as a junior playing alongside eventual No. 1 overall pick of the Houston Texans Jadeveon Clowney. He spent the summer with the Giants and played in the team's fourth preseason game against the Patriots. 
Gaston played in 50 consecutive games over four seasons at Purdue with 44 starts and finished with 131 total tackles, seven sacks, four fumble recoveries and two forced fumbles.
"It’s a position that we didn’t feel like we had a great deal of depth in," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said in a conference call on Tuesday. "They’re young. They’re healthy. They’re big. They run well. They have good physical qualities. They have good mental makeup. They’ve been productive in preseason on other teams. So, some combination of all those things I guess."
Quarles' signing is an interesting one because the Patriots saw him in action so recently. Belichick explained that, along with whatever evaluations they had of Quarles leading up to last week, New England's front office got a good feel for Quarles' abilities after seeing him go against Patriots players on Thursday. 
"There’s a decent amount of tape on Kelcy prior to our game, but I think he played in the neighborhood of 30 plays, or something like that, against us," Belichick said. "It was certainly a chance for us to get a closer evaluation and also see him against people that we know how good they are because they’re our players. Sometimes when you’re watching guys on film, you not only have to evaluate the player that you’re looking at, but also the competition that he’s against. So we had a lot better handle on that. Yeah, I think that game was consistent with what it’s been from him. Again, for a young player it’s always good to have two or three games."How Quarles and Gaston factor in to Belichick's defensive game plans going forward remains to be seen. If Jones and Siliga are healthy, they may serve as road blocks to Quarles and Gaston becoming anything more than depth options.
Siliga, the 6-foot-2, 325-pound defensive tackle who eventually became a starter with Vince Wilfork out injured last season, told reporters on Monday that he's ready to play. 
“I feel great, I’m ready to get this thing going and ready to play on Sunday,” Siliga said. “It’s been about a month since I have taken my last snap, so that’s what today is for and the next few days, to get back out there running around with the fellas and see what I can pick up.”  FOXBORO -- Ever since the Patriots lost two of their defensive linemen -- Chris Jones (ankle) and Sealver Siliga (wrist) -- to injury early in training camp, they've moved to add depth to that position group.
