More #Cowboys moves: Special teams ace CJ Spillman is on his way to Dallas, expect him to sign with them in the morning

Spillman was undrafted out of Marshall University in 2009 before signing with the San Diego Chargers. 
After a brief two-year stint with the Chargers, Spillman was claimed off waivers by the 49ers. 
He spent the last four seasons in San Francisco but was released on final cut-down day Saturday. 
The 28-year-old was one of the team's primary backup safeties, and among their high-caliber special teamers. 
The 49ers decided to go younger with Brad Seely's special teams unit, and would part ways with Spillman, who was set to earn $1.225 in base salary this season. 
Spillman made 67 tackles in his tenure with the 49ers, including a career-high 25 in 2013. 
The 49ers kick off the 2014 NFL season against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, TX on Sunday, Sept. 7.
