Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Duke Ihenach&nbsp;is on a new team with a new role. But he knows his strengths, and he can apply them right away. The 25 year old&nbsp;will be quick to lay down the hammer.  &ldquo;I just bring some physicality, man, and playmaking ability,&rdquo; Ihenacho said, via ESPN.com, &ldquo;a little more excitement, a little more passion to the game.&rdquo; Where he&rsquo;ll apply that physicality isn&rsquo;t exactly certain. He was just picked up on waivers Monday. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the defense too much,&rdquo; Ihenacho said. &ldquo;Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get squared up.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s one placed they&rsquo;d love to have him: special teams. Via ESPN.com, the Redskins are attempting to ramp up their special teams this season. Ihenacho can be a part of that. &ldquo;I think kickoff is the easiest thing in the world,&rdquo; Ihenacho said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got that mentality then they put you on kickoff because you like doing it.&rdquo; Ihenacho took Akeem Davis&rsquo; spot on the roster. Davis was just as able on special teams, but Ihenacho has more experience from scrimmage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tough guy and became available,&rdquo; Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. &ldquo;We thought he could be immediate help and we&rsquo;re lucky we got him.&rdquo; He may be relied upon at safety while Brandon Meriweather serves his two-game suspension. &ldquo;It depends on how quickly he picks it up mentally,&rdquo; Gruden said. &ldquo;I envision him participating in some capacity, but it&rsquo;s too early to tell. We&rsquo;ll see how much he can pick up and help on special teams. Whether he&rsquo;s activated or not, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
