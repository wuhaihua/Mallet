			Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to an 'exceptional' Liverpool performance following their 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur.The build-up had centred around Mario Balotelli's debut but it was the complete display which most pleased Rodgers in an emphatic victory.Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno scored for Liverpool on an afternoon when they carved out several other chances and also looked solid at the back.Asked to pick out the best aspect of how Liverpool played, Rodgers told Sky Sports: "I think that everything that could be good in our game, was there.Â "Our organisation defensively was very strong, we played the diamond for the first hour and were a threat in between the lines in midfield, and obviously the two boys up front were fantastic."Our quality was exceptional. We got three goals and could maybe have had more. Defensively we were resolute, kept the lines tight together to minimise their chances, and closed the game out very well, so all round it was a great three points for us."Rodgers was particularly delighted with the clean sheet as Liverpool bounced back from a 3-1 defeat by Manchester City to notch a second victory in three games.He said: "We talked about it a lot in pre-season, and for us it's about concentration."I thought the back four and goalkeeper were excellent, and we created protection in front of them with our diamond and the two guys up front worked their socks off."Today was very much a great symbol of what we are, which is a very good team."Rodgers added: "It is two wins out of thee so it is a good start. Today we showed out quality and out intensity."
