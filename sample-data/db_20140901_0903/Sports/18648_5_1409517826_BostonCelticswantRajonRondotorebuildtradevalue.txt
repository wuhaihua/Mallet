Boston Celtics want Rajon Rondo to rebuild trade value? Boston Celtics want Rajon Rondo to rebuild trade value? Mar 1, 2014; Boston, MA, USA; Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo (9) sits on the floor after being called for a foul during the fourth quarter of BostonNBA    If the Boston Celtics do plan to trade point guard Rajon Rondo, doing so right now would be a poor decision.  The former Kentucky guard didn&rsquo;t look good in his return from injury last season and given his impending free agent status, the assumption is that most would attempt to acquire the former All-Star at a bargain basement price. Doing such is a smart move for those interested in trading for Rajon Rondo, though the Boston Celtics would be better served by allowing their franchise player to rebuild his trade value. That&rsquo;s the thought of Steve Kyler who suggests that a Rajon Rondo trade is inevitable, though the Boston Celtics will likely wait until Rondo shows he&rsquo;s healthy in effort to get more value in a trade. .@SwHTown20: &mdash; I have said for a while that I think its inevitable that Boston trades him, they can;t get to July and lose him for nothing &mdash; Steve Kyler (@stevekylerNBA) August 31, 2014   .@SwHTown20: &ndash;&gt; that said, I don&rsquo;t think he returns much until he plays 15-30 games and looks good enough for a contender to bite. &mdash; Steve Kyler (@stevekylerNBA) August 31, 2014   Unless a team is willing to overpay at this point, moving Rondo at the current moment doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a smart move for the Celtics. That&rsquo;s not to say they&rsquo;ll wait until the deadline as the pressure would then be on them to make a deal. Obviously there is risk involved as Rondo could be injured during that time span, but that seems like a gamble worth taking if Boston wants to secure the biggest return possible.
