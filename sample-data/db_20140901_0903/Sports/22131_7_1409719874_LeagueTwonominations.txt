			Gary Rowett, Jim Bentley, Micky Mellon and Mark Yates are the nominees for the Sky Bet League Two Manager of the Month award for August.Burton Albion boss Rowett heads the list after guiding his side to the fourth tier summit, but Yates’ Cheltenham Town have made an equally impressive start.Mellon has Shrewsbury among the early frontrunners, with Bentley also looking for Morecambe to build from here and mount a sustained promotion push.Cheltenham and Morecambe also have contenders for the Player of the Month prize, in the form of Trevor Carson and Kevin Ellison.Two players to have been on the move over the summer complete the list, with AFC Wimbledon’s Matt Tubbs and Wycombe Wanderers’ Peter Murphy seeing their fine form recognised.Here, Sky Sports take a more in-depth look at those up for Manager of the Month gong:Jim Bentley (Morecambe)Inspired the players around him to four straight wins to start the campaign. The team spirit he engendered was shown in abundance in the 3-2 comeback win over Newport County.Micky Mellon (Shrewsbury Town)Made an immediate impact in Shropshire, banishing memories of relegation with a surge of attacking play that collected 11 points with 11 goals from five unbeaten matches to become the division’s leading scorers.Gary Rowett (Burton Albion)No sign of any play-off final hangover, Rowett is filling his players with energy and determination, and they picked up 13 points from 15 to sit top of Sky Bet League 2, conceding just three goals.Mark Yates (Cheltenham Town)A near perfect month as his side established itself as promotion contenders. Away wins at Bury and Tranmere Rovers were the cornerstones of a 13-point haul from five matches, which included three clean sheets.Sky Sports also casts an eye over those up for the Player of Month award:Trevor Carson (Cheltenham Town) – goalkeeperThree clean sheets in five games merely hint at Carson’s month. A superb last-minute stop at his old club Bury preserved a 1-0 win. He made more fine saves against Carlisle United and even came up with an assist in the winning goal over Accrington Stanley.Kevin Ellison (Morecambe) – strikerThe 35-year-old has started the season brilliantly. Served up a low driven free-kick in the 3-0 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, before an even better one against Newport County. Also scored two headers, while his inventiveness provided an assist against Cambridge United.Peter Murphy (Wycombe Wanderers) – midfielderAs new signings go, Murphy has had a marvellous impact since his arrival from Accrington Stanley. Already a crowd favourite for his driving runs into the area, he scored three in five to lift Wycombe among the frontrunners.Matt Tubbs (AFC Wimbledon) – strikerHis finishing ability is setting him apart in League 2. Four sharply-taken goals in five games, bearing his trademark combination of positioning and pace, have been pivotal to Wimbledon’s comfortable start.
