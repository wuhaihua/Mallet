The group gathered in a circle and prayed before Stewart climbed back into his car for the first time after skipping three races.Fans, eager to welcome one of NASCAR's most popular and polarizing figures back to the sport, scrawled messages of support on his pit wall."Guys be careful. Be safe down there. Appreciate it," Stewart radioed his crew as he came around to take the green flag.The three-time Sprint Cup champion remains under investigation in the death of sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr., whom Stewart struck and killed during a race at Canandaigua (N.Y.) Motorsports Park on Aug. 9.Stewart, who sat out races at Watkins Glen International, Michigan International Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway while grieving for Ward Jr., qualified 12th for the race at the 1.54-mile oval. He has won here three times.On Friday, NASCAR granted him a waiver to participate in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. So despite him missing time in the car during the regular season, Stewart will make the 16-driver championship field if he wins Sunday night or next weekend at Richmond International Raceway.PHOTOS: Tony Stewart through the years
