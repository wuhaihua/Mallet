Seahawks' Harvin ruled out for NFC Championship Seahawks' Harvin ruled out for NFC Championship  Percy Harvin has been ruled out of Sunday's NFC Championship, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll announced on Friday. The big-play wide receiver did not pass through the NFL's concussion-related protocol and is therefore will not play against the 49ers.
"It's super disappointing for Percy," Carroll said. "He wants to play. You could see it. He played his tail off when he had his chance. Just unfortunate circumstances.”
Harvin was injured late in the first half of Saturday's NFC divisional playoff win over New Orleans. Harvin hit his head hard on the turf after jumping for a pass in the end zone. It was the second big hit Harvin took in the game. Before being injured, Harvin had three receptions and one carry in just his second game of the season. Harvin injured his hip in August and was sidelined most of the season. Harvin wasn’t able to contribute much after Seattle gave up a first-round pick to get him.
It’s been a disappointment for the player and coach, but should make life a little easier on the 49ers secondary.
Having Harvin would’ve been a bonus for Seattle, but the Seahawks have functioned well without him this season.
“We’ve been able to function the way that we have functioned this season because we don’t let things like this disturb us,” Carroll said. “We’d love to have him, but not this time.”
Carroll also announced that linebacker K.J. Wright will play on Sunday in his first game since breaking bones in his foot on Dec. 8. He made 13 starts, 80 tackles and had 1.5 sacks before an injury that required surgery.
