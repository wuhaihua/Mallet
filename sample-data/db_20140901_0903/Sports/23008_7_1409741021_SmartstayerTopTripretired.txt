			Francois Doumen has announced the retirement of his high-class stayer Top Trip.Now five, Top Trip had not appeared at all this season but had been entered in both the Qipco British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot and even the Caulfield Cup in Australia.The son of Dubai Destination's most significant victory came in the Group Two Prix Hocquart as a three-year-old but he ran some even better races in defeat.Last year he finished a nose second to Glen's Diamond in the Yorkshire Cup and was third in the memorable Gold Cup won by Estimate."The horse is now retired from racing due to injury," said Doumen."It's sad as we were getting him ready to come back. He means a lot to us as we bred him ourselves and he was a very good horse."We're now looking for a home for him in his retirement."
