White Sox Road Ahead: Finding the next DH White Sox Road Ahead: Finding the next DH  The White Sox continued their fire sale Sunday when they announced designated hitter Adam Dunn had been dealt to the Oakland A's for pitching prospect Nolan Sanburn. The hole left by Dunn was filled Sunday against the Tigers by prospect Andy Wilkins, who went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in his major league debut. Wilkins played first while slugger Jose Abreu, batting third, DH'd, but heading into the offseason it's apparent Rick Hahn will need to address the position.
Chuck Garfein and Bill Melton analyzed just that in this week's White Sox Road Ahead, presented by Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana Honda Dealers.
"The White Sox now will be looking for a DH next season, likely a left-handed DH if they can get it because they need some more left-handed bats, certainly in the middle of their order," Garfein said. "One guy who's a possibility free agent next year, is Victor Martinez."
Added Melton: "I think if you're going to protect that young man by the name of Abreu, you're going to need a veteran and a quality hitter and he's not catching anymore, he doesn't play first base anymore, he's a class switch-hitter, one of the best in the game. I would say if he's interested in the White Sox then they will go after someone like him."
Martinez, 36, is enjoying one of his best seasons in the bigs. In 124 games, the 2014 All-Star is batting .328 with 27 home runs and 87 RBIs. He's struck out just 39 times, scored 72 times and leads the majors with 23 intentional walks.
He's set to become a free agent after this season and the White Sox reportedly are interested in pursuing him.
This week the White Sox travel to Minnesota for a quick two-game set, beginning with a Tuesday matchup on CSN. Then they begin a weekend series in Cleveland, with Friday's and Sunday's contests appearing right here on Comcast SportsNet.
