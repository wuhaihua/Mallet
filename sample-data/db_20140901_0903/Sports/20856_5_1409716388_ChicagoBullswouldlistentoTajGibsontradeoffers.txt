Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY SportsNBA    After the Chicago Bulls signed Pau Gasol this offseason, trade rumors began to swirl around power forward/center Taj Gibson.  Would the Bulls really consider trading away the studly, young defender? It was a questionable stance given Pau Gasol, while talented on the offensive end, isn&rsquo;t going to help the Bulls defensively and is in the twilight of his career. Alas, there is still concrete answer regarding a potential move. The alleged trade rumors surrounding Taj Gibson weren&rsquo;t exactly shut down by the Chicago Bulls, though they didn&rsquo;t appear to be overly enthusiastic to make a move either. Might they be waiting for the right offer? It&rsquo;s a possibility as Hoops Rumors suggests the Chicago Bulls would likely be willing to listen assuming the price was right. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of teams that would like to have Gibson, and I&rsquo;m sure the Bulls would listen if a team made the right offer. For what it&rsquo;s worth, Hoops Rumors goes on to suggest one shouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;hold their breath&rsquo; in regards to a Taj Gibson trade, though it doesn&rsquo;t appear they&rsquo;re hanging up the phone if somebody is to make a call either. That said, extracting Gibson from the Chicago Bulls would take a significant amount of assets considering not only is Gibson one of the best defensive big men in the league, but he&rsquo;s also signed to a very reasonable contract through the 2016-17 season. Needless to say, it doesn&rsquo;t appear as if Taj Gibson will be leaving the Windy City in the near future unless an opposing franchise wants to significantly overpay.
