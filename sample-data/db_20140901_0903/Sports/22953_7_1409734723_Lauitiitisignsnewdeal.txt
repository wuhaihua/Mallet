			Wakefield veteran Ali Lauitiiti has extended his career by signing a new two-year deal with the Wildcats.The former New Zealand international will continue playing past his 37th birthday after the club tied him down on a deal until the end of 2016.Lauitiiti has made 224 Super League appearances since leaving Auckland Warriors in 2004, the last 60 for Wakefield after joining from Leeds Rhinos three years ago."I'm grateful to get the opportunity to sign up again and thankful to the club," said the 35-year-old, who made his comeback in July after undergoing major knee surgery in mid-season."It's been an enjoyable three years. It's a great bunch of boys and the coaching staff are good so, although we've had some tough times, the boys have stuck together and had a good team spirit."Ability Wildcats coach James Webster is glad to secure the services of Lauitiiti, who became the sixth out-of-contract player to sign a new deal with the club."Not too many teams possess players with the impact and offensive ability that Ali does," said Webster."Ali showed a great determination and willingness to play when he got back from his knee injury so we've got a player who is fully committed and I'm really happy we've got him on board."I'm really excited about what he brings to our group. There are very few people over the last ten years that have been able to make an impact in Super League like he has."
