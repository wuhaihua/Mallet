                    The 49ers&#39; latest arrest, defensive tackle Ray McDonald on felony domestic violence charges, may be the most disturbing.

Coach Jim Harbaugh said Tuesday that he and the organization won&#39;t tolorate it.

&quot;There&#39;s going to be two principles at play here, and one is, I&#39;ll speak for myself, I&#39;ll speak for the 49ers, we will not tolerate domestic violence,&quot; Harbaugh said, according to an ESPN.com report. &quot;Second principle is we&#39;re firm believers in due process. And I ask for your understanding on those two principles.

&quot;If someone physically abuses a woman and/or physically or mentally abuses or hurts a child, then there&#39;s no understanding,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#39;s no tolerance for that.&quot;

It was not clear if McDonald will play in San Francisco&#39;s season opener at Dallas or even practive this week. The NFL recently instituted penalties for domestic abuse&nbsp;&mdash; six games for first offense, a lifetime ban for the second &mdash; and can issue them even before due process. McDonald has not yet received punishment from the league.&nbsp;

&quot;I can&#39;t say too much, not right now, but the truth will come out,&quot; McDonald claimed&nbsp;Sunday. &quot;Everybody knows the kind of person that I am. I&#39;m a good-hearted person.&quot;
