Mandatory Credit: Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    Cyler Miles will start at quarterback for the Washington Huskies on Saturday after serving a one-week suspension for his role in a fight last winter.  Miles was involved in an altercation after the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl and although he was not charged by the police, he was held out of spring practice and head coach Chris Petersen said at Pac-12 Media Days in July that he would sit the season opener against Hawaii. &ldquo;I think we took some pretty hard action when things were still being decided,&rdquo; Petersen said at Pac-12 Media Days. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything with us football-wise [during the spring]. You have a brand-new staff teaching this, and you take a guy out and give him nothing at that position> &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;re also going to sit him for the first game. I think [Miles] will learn.&rdquo; Jeff Lindquist started at quarterback and completed 10-of-26 passes for 162 yards and a touchdown in the huskies 17-16 win over a down Hawaii team that won one game last year. This was not the type of debut Petersen was hopeful for after leaving Boise State for the job with Washington, but the return of Miles should spark an offense that only racked up 336 yards for the game. Miles appeared in eight games last year and started the game against the Oregon State Beavers, completing 37-of-61 passes for 418 yards and four touchdowns. He was a former four-star recruit and one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks coming out of high school.
