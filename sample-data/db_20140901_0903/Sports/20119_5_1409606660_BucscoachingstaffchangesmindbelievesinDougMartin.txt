Bucs coaching staff changes mind, believes in Doug Martin Bucs coaching staff changes mind, believes in Doug Martin Sep 15, 2013; Tampa, FL, USA; Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Doug Martin (22) catches the ball as he works out prior to the game against the New Orleans Saints at Raymond James Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Doug Martin was a massive disappointment during the 2013 NFL season. The back rushed for just 456 yards on 127 carries than saw his season end 10 games early due to a shoulder injury.  But Martin could be in store for a monster comeback year, considering the change-in-mind the Bucs&rsquo; new coaching staff has had about the 25-year-old&rsquo;s abilities during preseason play. From ESPN Insider (subscription needed): The Bucs&rsquo; new coaching staff came in believing starting tailback&nbsp;Doug Martin&nbsp;could not be effective as a pass-catcher. But that opinion changed in a big way after Martin used training camp and the preseason to show his versatility. The team drafted&nbsp;Charles Sims&nbsp;to be its pass-catching running back, but he is out with an injury for at least half the season. So not only will Martin get the bulk of the Bucs&rsquo; carries, he will get plenty of chances as a receiver out of the backfield.&nbsp;&ndash; Pat Yasinskas Martin showed flashes of greatness during his rookie season, so the fact that he&rsquo;s impressed Lovie Smith and Co. isn&rsquo;t too shocking. He rushed for a whopping 1,454 yards (4.6 yards per carry) and 11 touchdowns in 2012. He also caught 49 balls for for 472 yards and one more score. That well-rounded ability clearly caught the Bucs&rsquo; staff&rsquo;s mind and it&rsquo;s why Martin could&nbsp;be&nbsp;the focal point of the team&rsquo;s offense. Tampa Bay drafted Martin with the No. 31 pick of the 2012 NFL Draft. &nbsp; &nbsp;
