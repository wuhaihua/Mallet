                    A high school football game in Ohio was canceled in the third quarter on Friday night&nbsp;when a bench-clearing brawl erupted between Garfield Heights and Collinwood High School, prompting law enforcement to get involved.

It all started when Garfield Heights, ahead 26-6, punted away to Collinwood on fourth down. A Collinwood player delivered a late hit to a Garfield Heights player after the play was dead, and the two benches spilled onto the field.



While the fight broke out on the field, fans in the stands got tangled up as well. Police were called to the scene and tried to defuse the situation.

According to Fox 8 in Cleveland, two people, including a football player, were taken to Marymount Hospital and authorities say that three people were arrested.

The game was canceled in the third quarter&nbsp;and both teams were issued&nbsp;a loss in the standings.
