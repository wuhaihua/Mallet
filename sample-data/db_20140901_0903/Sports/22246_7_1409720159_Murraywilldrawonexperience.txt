			Andy Murray admits he will draw strength from his memorable grand slam victories against Novak Djokovic as he battles the Serb for a place in the US Open semi-finals.Djokovic has a 12-8 record against his former world junior rival ahead of what will be their earliest meeting between the pair at a grand slam event.But Murray has beaten Djokovic in two of their last three grand slam meetings, the 2012 final at Flushing Meadow – where Murray won his first grand slam – and last year's emotional Wimbledon final where the Scot became the first Brit in 77 years to win the title."They obviously will help," said Murray. "I wouldn't say in terms of getting confidence, it's just having that experience of playing those matches."They were both very long, tough matches, as well so I know that I can last those matches against him.“But anything can happen in a couple of days. I'll just do everything properly and hope on Wednesday I play a good match."Murray admits he is relishing the prospect of tackling the World No1 under the lights at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.“I think that's really why we play the game,” he said. “That's what you put the work in for, so that when you come to these events and you do have to play against the best players, you're ready."And as much as it's incredibly tough and challenging, that's what you enjoy. Playing on Wednesday night against the number one player in the world is exciting."If you aren't getting motivated or pumped for those matches, then that's when there's a problem and it's time to maybe stop."Murray insists he will need to play to his absolute maximum if he is to beat the seven-time grand slam winner."He knows how to play on centre court at the US Open where he has played some great tennis and we've had some great matches,” he added. “It's a very tough draw. I'm going to have to be playing my highest level in order to advance."I think he performs his best in the grand slams. He's been on and off this year but I think in the big matches, as the tournament progresses, he's still fit.“He still plays very high-quality tennis. That's what I expect him to do."
