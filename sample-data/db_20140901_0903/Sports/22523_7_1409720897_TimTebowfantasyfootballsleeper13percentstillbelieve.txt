                    Tim Tebow went from ESPN coverage darling to ESPN television personality. Yet somehow, he&#39;s still an ESPN fantasy football sleeper.

According to network, he&#39;s still being drafted in 1.3 percent of such leagues on ESPN -- even though, you know, he doesn&#39;t play actual quarterback in the NFL anymore. (Some would say that was also the&nbsp;case when he was active in the league).


In @ESPNFantasy leagues, 1.3% of teams own Tim Tebow, while 0.8% of teams own Jaguars starting QB Chad Henne. Seriously.

What&#39;s worse is that some people are taking Tebow, a Jackonsville native, and leaving the Jaguars starter for Week 1. And no, once again,&nbsp;Tebow will never be playing for the Jaguars.

Chad Henne? He&#39;s far&nbsp;from&nbsp;the worst flyer in two-quarterback leagues against the Philadelphia Eagles. Tebow, however, is guaranteed to get no points for anyone by saying &quot;exciting&quot; over and over again on air talking about college games for the SEC Network.

Unless your league has a position called Tebow, you would be out of luck. Let&#39;s hope no one in&nbsp;that&nbsp;1.3 percent is&nbsp;playing for money.
