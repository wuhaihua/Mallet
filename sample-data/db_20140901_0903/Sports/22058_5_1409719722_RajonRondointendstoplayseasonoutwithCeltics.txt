Rajon Rondo 'intends' to play season out with Celtics Rajon Rondo 'intends' to play season out with Celtics Mar 1, 2014; Boston, MA, USA; Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo (9) brings the ball up court against the Indiana Pacers during the fourth quarter of IndianaNBA    The Rajon Rondo trade rumors are everlasting and won&rsquo;t end until the summer of 2015 is over. This past weekend, it was reported that Rondo waned out of Boston, asking for a trade. Following that report&ndash;which stemmed from ESPN&rsquo;s Around the Horn&ndash;both Rondo and his agent denied the accusation, claiming a trade demand never came into fruition. Now Sean Deveny of Sporting News reports news following alongside of the latter report, claiming Rondo&rsquo;s trade demands are false and the point guard plans to play the season out as a member of the Boston Celtics. From Sporting News: Thus, sources on both sides disputed the suggestion that emerged this weekend that Rondo had requested a trade from the Celtics &mdash; it is still his intention to play out his contract in Boston, and it&rsquo;s still the Celtics intention to begin the season with him as the starting point guard. Danny Ainge has no plans to sell low on Rajon Rondo if he does decide to&nbsp;pull the trigger on a trade before Rondo becomes an unrestricted free agent in the upcoming summer.  What the Minnesota Timberwolves received for Kevin Love (Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett) is what Ainge may demand&nbsp;in return for Rondo, except teams may not be willing to flip tradeable assets for a point guard whose nearing 30, recovering from injury, and has been unable to consistently knock down jump shots in a league where floor-spacing has become the premium. No one knows who this is going to play out. Rondo has become the face of the franchise in the last few years but, as we see on a daily basis, the NBA is a business and Ainge is going to do what he has to do to make sure the Celtics are well-off now and in the immediate future&ndash;we saw that when the Celtics traded Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Brooklyn Nets for future picks&ndash;and that could eventually mean trading his star point guard.
