			Ruler Of The World could make his return to action in the Prix Foy as trainer Aidan O'Brien eyes a second crack at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.Last year's Investec Derby hero was only seventh to Treve in the Longchamp feature and has not raced since disappointing in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan in March.A setback in the summer meant Ruler Of The World could not run in the Coronation Cup back at Epsom but O'Brien reports the colt to be 100% again now and the Foy on September 14 has been pencilled in."We had him ready to run in the Coronation Cup (at Epsom). We were very happy with him and he just tweaked a muscle in his side so he had a nice break after that, but he's back and has been working away," the Ballydoyle trainer told At The Races."He worked nicely the last day he was away. It is very possible he will start in the Foy with a view, if all goes well, of going back to the Arc."I'm very happy where we are with him at the moment."Magician is another of O'Brien's star four-year-olds and his main objective is to bid to repeat last season's triumph in the Breeders' Cup Turf."He's back in full work. He came back from America in good shape," he said."Obviously he's in the Irish Champion and all those races. He's building up to the Irish Champions weekend but if he doesn't run he'll go away for a work and then come back again."We have one eye on the Breeders' Cup Turf with him and that's where he could finish up at the end of the year. We'll see what he does in between then."
