Buchholz in 'complete command' against Rays Buchholz in 'complete command' against Rays August 31, 2014, 7:00 pm ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Clay Buchholz cruised past the Tampa Bay Rays.
Buchholz threw a three-hitter to stop his string of seven starts without a win, leading the Boston Red Sox over the Rays 3-0 on Sunday.
Buchholz (6-8) walked none and struck out six. Only one runner reached second base during his second shutout this season and the sixth of his career.
"He was in complete command for nine innings," Boston manager John Farrell said. "Outstanding."
The right-hander's previous win came over Kansas City on July 18, five days after he tossed a three-hitter in an 11-0 win against Houston. He was 0-3 in that span.
"I felt good with all my pitches," said Buchholz, who threw just 98. "It doesn't always happen that way, but it's fun when it does."
Buchholz is the first Boston pitcher since Pedro Martinez in 2000 to have a pair of shutouts on three or fewer hits and no walks in the same season.
Alex Cobb (9-7) gave up two runs and seven hits over 6 1-3 innings and took his first loss in two months. After losing to Pittsburgh on June 23, Cobb went 7-0 with a 2.14 ERA in 11 starts entering Sunday.
"He had his `A' game going today and when he's on like that, it's tough to scratch across runs," Cobb said about Buchholz.  ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Clay Buchholz cruised past the Tampa Bay Rays.
