CFL's Montreal Alouettes reach out to Michael Sam CFL's Montreal Alouettes reach out to Michael Sam Aug 23, 2014; Cleveland, OH, USA; St. Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam (96) during warm ups before the game against the St. Louis Rams at FirstEnergy Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Michael Sam is a man looking for a job after the St. Louis Rams released him on Saturday and did not add him to their practice squad on Monday and may have to cross the border if he wants to play professional football this season.  Sam cleared waivers and is free to sign with any team, but according to NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport, Sam could find a home in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes who own his rights. Last year&rsquo;s co-SEC Defensive Player of the Year may want to hold off on heading north in the hopes that an NFL team will find room for the former Missouri standout on the 53-man roster or the 10-man practice squad and as a result did not get back to the Alouettes after they reached out to him. Sam slipped in the draft because of his slow time in the 40, lack of ideal athletic ability and because he is too short at 6-2 to play defensive end. He is the classis tweener. Too small to play defensive end and too slow to play linebacker, but his deficiencies would be lessened in the CFL, so perhaps he can be the first openly gay player to play in the CFL. In turn that could help his case of making an NFL team later in his career if he shows he can be a solid contributor. Montreal made headlines when they signed former Pro Bowl receiver Chad Johnson earlier this year and were previously coached by current Chicago Bears head coach Marc Trestman.
