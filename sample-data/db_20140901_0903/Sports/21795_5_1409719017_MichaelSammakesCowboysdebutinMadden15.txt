Michael Sam makes Cowboys debut in Madden 15 Michael Sam makes Cowboys debut in Madden 15 EA sportsGaming    Although Jerry Jones didn&rsquo;t get his Johnny Manziel sized trophy during the NFL Draft, he definitely was able to secure another talking point.&nbsp; Despite the St. Louis Rams not being able to find any room for Michael Sam on their roster, the Jerry Jones Circus, otherwise known as the Dallas Cowboys, plan to sign Sam to their practice squad.  Now let&rsquo;s take a subjective look at this.&nbsp; The Rams have plenty of talent on the defensive line, and no one is taking Robert Quinn&lsquo;s playing time any day soon.&nbsp; The Cowboys also have one of the worst defenses in the NFL.&nbsp; That being said, it&rsquo;s Jerry Jones. The issue here is that Sam is arguably good enough to be on an NFL roster, but Jones bringing him in to play on the practice squad screams media attention.&nbsp; While not on the active roster, Sam is a member of the Cowboys, but more as a media piece than a viable contributor. At any rate, in Madden 15, Michael Sam will now switch from the blue and gold of the Rams to the silver of the Cowboys.&nbsp; Wearing number 96 for the Cowboys, take a look at how Sam is depicted tearing down the field. Coming out of Missouri with exceptional, SEC, level skills, he could be effectively utilized in Madden 15.&nbsp; With the new defensive player camera, Michael Sam could be user controlled to be the tackles and get to opposing quarterbacks.&nbsp; One can only hope that he is actually used in Madden 15 rather than being buried on a depth chart for nothing more than show.
