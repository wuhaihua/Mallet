Guard Alex Boone will report to the 49ers on Monday, ending a contract holdout that began in during the offseason program and throughout training camp, according to a source.

Boone will still have two years remaining on his contract.
As part of the agreement, the 49ers can not place the franchise tag on Boone at the end of the conclusion of the contract.
Financial terms of the new agreement were not known. Boone was scheduled to make $2 million in salary this season and $1 million 2015.
The side had gone more than a month without negotiating, a source said. But the sides got together quickly on a new deal after the 49ers’ initial cuts Saturday for their 53-man roster.
