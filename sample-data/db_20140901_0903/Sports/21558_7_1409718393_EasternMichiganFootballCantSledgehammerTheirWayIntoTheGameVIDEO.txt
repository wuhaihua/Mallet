College football opened this weekend and it was so glorious &#8212; Michigan and Michigan State both opened with convincing wins.
Eastern Michigan also opened their season as well as they took on the Morgan State Bears. The Eagles won the game 31-28 but it&#8217;s not what happened during the game that made national news, it was the thing that happened beforehand.
Eastern&#8217;s football field is now gray because their new coach wants to show toughness.
Eastern&#8217;s new coach, Chris Creighton, has said his team is so tough they could play on a parking lot. All sounded good until they took the field on Saturday.
The Eagles planned to use a sledge hammer to knock down a cinder block wall &#8212; and it didn&#8217;t go as planned. It only took roughly 16 swings of the sledgehammer to take down the wall.
Is this the worst entrance for a college football team ever?
