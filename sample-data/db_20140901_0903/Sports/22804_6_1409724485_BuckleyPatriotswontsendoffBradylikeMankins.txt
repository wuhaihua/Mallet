Buckley: Patriots won’t send off Brady like Mankins Buckley: Patriots won’t send off Brady like Mankins September 3, 2014, 1:15 am When the Patriots traded Logan Mankins to the Buccaneers, many began to wonder how Tom Brady's tenure would end. 
Brady discussed his future on WEEI Tuesday morning.
"When I suck, I’ll retire." said Brady. "I don’t plan on sucking for a long time. Hopefully that leads me to be in here, and there’s no place I’d rather be. I love this game and I love working hard at it."
Steve DeOssie and Steve Buckley joined Sports Tonight to predict whether or not Tom Brady will end his career with the Patriots.
"If he gets to be 80% of what he is right now, that's still better than most quarterbacks, but probably not good enough for Tom Brady," explained DeOssie. "He's used to an extremely high level of efficiency and greatness.  Most guys go out of the league kicking and screaming. A guy like this, I have a feeling he's going to go out a lot more gracefully than that."
Will the 'Patriot way' catch up to Brady? Or will the quarterback decide when the team go in another direction at the position?
"It happened to Logan Mankins, it happened to Lawyer Milloy, it happened with Willie McGinest, it happens with all these guys," said Buckley. "I'm saying, given his reach with the franchise and what he has meant to the franchise, I'm submitting it won't happen with him." 
Bob Neumeier compares Brady's situation with another aging star's decision to retire.
"Time waits for no man," said Neumeier. "The music will stop for Tom Brady. It stops for everybody.  But it's uncomfortable when you're an icon. It's happening in New York right now with Derek Jeter… He's not hitting, he's not fielding, but because he's Derek Jeter he must play."
