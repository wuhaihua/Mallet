Carolina Panthers not expected to sign WR Stephen Hill Carolina Panthers not expected to sign WR Stephen Hill Jul 27, 2013; Spartanburg, SC USA; A Carolina Panthers helmet lays on the field during training camp held at Wofford College. Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY SportsNFL    After Stephen Hill was shockingly released by the New York Jets, it was doubtful the wide receiver would clear waivers.  That was the hope of Hill&rsquo;s agent who hinted he&rsquo;d prefer to see the Carolina Panthers put in a claim on the wideout, suggesting that their coaching staff would be the best for the third-year product. The 23-year-old wasn&rsquo;t claimed by the Carlina Panthers or any other team, which may have been more shocking than his initial release. Though that didn&rsquo;t stop the Panthers from showing interest as they brought the former Georgia Tech product in for a workout on Monday afternoon. How did things go? As of right now there&rsquo;s no word on if Hill&rsquo;s workout was a success, though it&rsquo;s not going to lead to a job with the Carolina Panthers organization as they team has no plans to sign him (at least not currently). Panthers worked out WRs Stephen Hill and Kadron Boone but have no immediate plans to sign either. Part of their ready list. &mdash; Steve Reed (@SteveReedAP) September 1, 2014  While much improved from the early portion of the offseason, the Carolina Panthers could still use some help at the wide receiver position> For now, it appears Stephen Hill will continue to look for an NFL job though judging by nobody making a waiver claim, he may find difficulty finding a new home.
