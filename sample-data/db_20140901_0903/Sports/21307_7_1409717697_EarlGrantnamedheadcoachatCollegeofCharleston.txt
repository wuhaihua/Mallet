                    After a whirlwind discovery period sent the school&#39;s eight-person search panel back to the drawing board last week, the College of Charleston Cougars finally have their new head coach.

Former Clemson assistant coach Earl Grant has reportedly accepted the position left vacant when the school fired Doug Wojcik amid allegations of physical and verbal abuse, according to the Post and Courier.



The announcement comes just in time, too, with only 31 days left before the official start of college basketball season.

CofC president Glenn McConnell sent out an email on Tuesday announcing the hiring, and the school is expected to make the announcement official on Friday.

In a decade of stints as an assistant at The Citadel, Winthrop, Wichita State and, most recently, Clemson, Grant has established himself as a solid recruiter. He was responsible for securing the commitments of 10 of Clemson&#39;s 15 players who saw action last season, including K.J. McDaniels who went on to be drafted with the 32nd pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.

Former Charlotte 49ers coach Bobby Lutz was the second finalist for the job and visited Charleston this past weekend for an interview, according to the Post and Courier&#39;s report.
