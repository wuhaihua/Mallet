ALAMEDA – Tight end David Ausberry missed all of last season with a shoulder injury. He missed most of this preseason after having knee surgery.
All that time away can put things in perspective. That’s why Ausberry was so happy to practice on Monday afternoon. The fourth-year veteran was limited, but seems to be on track to play the regular-season opener at the New York Jets.
That will be key for a Raiders team woefully thin at tight end. Bringing Ausberry back will strengthen a position group that runs just three deep right now.
“You have to do whatever you can to stay in it and establish an edge,” Ausberry said. “I think I was able to do that, and helped me get into the flow of things on the field today.”
“I was excited to practice, and I’m definitely excited to play.”
