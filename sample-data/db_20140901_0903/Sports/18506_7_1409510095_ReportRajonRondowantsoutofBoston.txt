                    With Kevin Love officially traded to the Cavaliers, Rajon Rondo can now claim the title of &quot;most disgruntled superstar&quot; in the NBA.

With the Celtics in rebuilding mode, the on-again off-again relationship with the Celtics&#39; front office and the 28-year-old point&nbsp;guard has hit yet another snag.



Despite previously stating that he wouldn&#39;t mind staying in Boston for the rest of his career, it appears as if Rondo is now asking the Celtics to trade him, like the Timberwolves did with&nbsp;Love.

ESPN Boston&#39;s&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackie MacMullen, appearing on Around The Horn, said that Rondo told the Celtics that he wants out and has told the Kings, one of his potential suitors, that he would not re-sign with them if he were to be traded to Sacramento.



This shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise. Rondo hasn&#39;t been truly happy in Boston since winning the NBA Championship in 2008. He hasn&#39;t been 100% healthy in two years, and the team is in the process rebuilding for the future.

That being said, Rondo has firmly put the ball in the Celtic&#39;s court. He has put them on notice. It is time for the Celtics to get the wheels moving or things could get ugly.
