			Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was unable to train with Belgium ahead of their friendly with Australia on Thursday night due to a suspected calf injury.City fans face a nervous wait to discover the extent of Kompany's injury after he was taken to hospital for a scan on Wednesday after being forced to miss training.It is not yet known which leg the Belgian's injury is affecting but he has been plagued by persistent problems with both calves in recent seasons."No @vincentkompany at training today," Belgium coach Marc Wilmots wrote on Twitter."He was taken to the hospital for a calf scan. We'll have to wait for the results."Kompany has been the bedrock of City's defence since he joined the club from Hamburg in 2008 and has clocked up 246 appearances during his time at the Etihad.The 28-year-old, who captained Belgium at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has represented his country on 62 occasions since making his debut in a 2-0 defeat by France in 2004.  Manchester City’s next game is on September 13 when they travel to the Emirates Stadium to play Arsenal.City's £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala has yet to feature in a match-day squad since the centre-back's arrival from Porto in mid-August while last season's back-up Matija Nastasic has not made a squad since playing 90 minutes in the Community Shield defeat by Arsenal.
