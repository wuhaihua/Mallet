			Manchester United have agreed a season-long loan deal with Monaco for striker Radamel Falcao. according to Sky sources.A plane is expected to come into Manchester airport at 4.50pm this afternoon from Nice and our sources expect Falcao to be on board as he heads for talks and a medical at Old Trafford. The last 24 hours have seen the Colombia international linked with a host of Premier League clubs including Arsenal and Manchester City as well as European champions Real Madrid.Real appeared to be favourites to sign Falcao after he tweeted "Hello Madrid" on Saturday – only to delete it not long afterwards, but United now look to have won the race to sign the 28-year-old. The arrival of Falcao may see Javier Hernandez or Danny Welbeck leave Old Trafford as United manager Louis van Gaal makes space in his squad.Hernandez has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, and Welbeck is reported to be wanted by a number of Premier League clubs with Sunderland, Arsenal, Tottenham and Hull City all interested.
