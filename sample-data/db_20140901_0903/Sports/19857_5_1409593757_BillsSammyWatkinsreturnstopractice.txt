Bills' Sammy Watkins returns to practice Bills' Sammy Watkins returns to practice Andrew Weber-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The Buffalo Bills took a big gamble when they traded away a haul of draft picks to move up and select wide receiver Sammy Watkins in the first round of the 2014 draft. As such, many interested eyes will be on Watkins when he makes his NFL debut.  A preseason injury cast some doubt on Watkins&rsquo; status for week 1 of the season. It has been a gradual process, but it sounds like Watkins is going to be able to put in the time to prep and be ready to open the season in the Bills&rsquo; starting lineup. Mike Rodak of ESPN reports that Watkins returned to practice on Monday. Sammy Watkins is present at start of practice today. Team in shells. Unclear how much he&rsquo;ll participate. &mdash; Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) September 1, 2014 Sammy Watkins taking part in RVAs.

How much of an impact Watkins can have will depend on a number of factors in addition to his health. That starts with quarterback E.J. Manuel, a guy whose credibility as an NFL quarterback is still very much in doubt. Even with all this uncertainty, however, there is plenty of excitement about seeing what Watkins can do.
