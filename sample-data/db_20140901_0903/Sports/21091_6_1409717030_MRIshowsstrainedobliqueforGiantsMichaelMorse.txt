MRI shows strained oblique for Giants' Michael Morse MRI shows strained oblique for Giants' Michael Morse   Giants-Rockies coverage starts tonight at 5 p.m. with Giants Pregame Live on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area
DENVER – Michael Morse was diagnosed with a strained lower oblique in his left side and will miss the final five games of the club’s road trip, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.

An MRI exam confirmed the muscle strain on Tuesday, one day after Morse tightened up during batting practice. Bochy said he was hopeful Morse would be improved in time for the next homestand.
For now, the Giants are down one more option at designated hitter for this weekend’s interleague series at Detroit’s Comerica Park.
Morse, who hit 13 home runs in his first 59 games, has hit just three homers over his last 71 games and his defense has cost the Giants a few costly outs in left field. His last five starts have come at first base.
