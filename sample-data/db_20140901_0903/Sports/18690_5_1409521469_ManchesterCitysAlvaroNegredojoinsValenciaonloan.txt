Sky Sports&rsquo; Guillem Balague was first to report the news, and suggested that Falcao will be targeted. Agreement for Negredo is total (loan and &euro;25m 2 b paid next season).

However, Carlo Ancelotti&rsquo;s side are now expected to sign Javier Hernandez on a season-long loan, leaving Falcao free to seek other clubs.
