With Gaby Zakuani away on international duty with DR Congo and Michael Bostwick still nursing an injury, an absent Brisley could leave Posh boss Darren Ferguson with a hole to plug in central defence.Kenny McEvoy is away with the Republic of Ireland Under-21 squad and, like Zakuani, will miss out both on Tuesday night and against Port Vale at the weekend.A shoulder injury keeps Orient striker Kevin Lisbie sidelined, but there could be involvement, possibly even a start, for fellow forward Shaun Batt.Batt has not played since August 12 as a calf problem has kept him out of action for around three weeks, but he is reportedly close to fitness.Elliot Omozusi and Jobi McAnuff will be assessed after both players had to be substituted due to injury in the O's 1-1 draw at Fleetwood and manager Russell Slade may rest them as a precaution.Goalkeeper Gary Woods may start following his appearances in Orient's Capital One Cup wins this term.Watch Peterborough v Leyton Orient live on Sky Sports 1, with coverage from 7.30pm.
