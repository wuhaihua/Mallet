Raiders tab rookie Carr as starting QB Raiders tab rookie Carr as starting QB There will be a rookie quarterback starting Week 1 after all.The Oakland Raiders on Monday named second-round pick Derek Carr the starter, not just for Sunday's game at the New York Jets, but for the indefinite future. Carr spent all of the preseason behind veteran Matt Schaub, whom the Raiders traded for in March."A lot of factors that were involved in that. It's not an indictment on Matt Schaub at all," head coach Dennis Allen said Monday evening. I" think it says more about where we feel Derek Carr is in his progression."Barring an unexpected move elsewhere this week, Carr will be the only rookie quarterback starting this week. Each of the three quarterbacks drafted ahead of Carr, Blake Bortles in Jacksonville, Johnny Manziel in Cleveland, and Teddy Bridgewater in Minnesota, are currently backups, as is the only other second-round pick, Jimmy Garoppolo in New England.That was the plan for Carr, too, for much of the preseason.Then Carr went out and completed 11-of-13 passes for 143 yards and three touchdowns in the preseason finale last week against Seattle, while Schaub sat out to rest a sore elbow."We've been watching this kid develop for along time now. Thursday night confirmed a lot of things in our mind," Allen said. "We felt like it was time."Schaub, who threw no touchdowns and completed only 51 percent of his passes in three preseason games, participated in Raiders practice on Monday, taking snaps after Carr.After years of turmoil at quarterback, the Raiders have to hope this will be the only switch they'll make at the position all year. "He's grown by leaps and bounds, and I think he's ready to accept the challenge," Allen said.
