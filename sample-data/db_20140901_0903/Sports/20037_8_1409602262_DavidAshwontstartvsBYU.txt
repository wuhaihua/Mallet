David Ash won't start vs. BYU David Ash won't start vs. BYU AUSTIN — Texas quarterback David Ash is out indefinitely after suffering the third documented concussion of his college career during a win against North Texas on Saturday, Texas coach Charlie Strong said Monday.Ash will miss at least this weekend's game against Brigham Young and be evaluated weekly, Strong said.He said Ash's injury occurred early in the first quarter of the 38-7 win, but that Ash did not begin to show concussion symptoms — headaches and dizziness — until later in the evening.But he showed no symptoms during the game, Strong said. Ash would throw for one touchdown and run for another after taking the hit."I don't know if he's hiding it, but he's a competitor," Strong said. "We have to be smart as coaches."A concussion cost Ash all but three games of last season, while a broken foot sidelined the senior for much of the spring.The latest head injury places his the remainder of his career in doubt: Ash's family and the school's medical staff will meet to decide whether Ash can retake the field this season.Ash will be replaced by sophomore Tyrone Swoopes, a former high-profile recruit, while freshman Jerrod Heard will serve as the backup."I'm very confident in Tyrone," Strong said. "Just do your job. It's that simple."In addition to Ash, Texas must move forward without senior center Dominic Espinosa, who fractured a bone in his leg and may miss the rest of the season. Espinosa will have surgery Wednesday, Strong said."Adversity is going to hit," he said. "The challenge of this football team is how well we hit back."
