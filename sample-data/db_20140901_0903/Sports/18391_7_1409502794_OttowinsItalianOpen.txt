			Hennie Otto closed out a two-shot victory at the Italian Open with a bogey-free final round of 68.The South African, two ahead overnight, had two birdies on each half of the Circolo Golf Torino course on the way to completing his third European Tour win, the first of which came at the same event in 2008.“The last three days have been superb," said Otto, who took control of the tournament with a second-round 62 on Friday.“I came in and struggled a bit on day one, then hit a terrible drive off the first on day two. You wonder then if you’re going to make the cut. Lo and behold, with the way the game is, I’ve played beautifully since then."Otto's 20-under-par total was two better than Englishman David Howell, whose best-of-the-day 63 secured second place and, in the process, ended Stephen Gallacher's bid for an automatic Ryder Cup spot.Gallacher needed a top-two finish in this, the final qualifying event, to pip Graeme McDowell for the last place via the world points list but, despite reaching the turn in 30 shots on Sunday, the Scot's eventual 65 saw him end up a stroke shy in third.Another Scot, Richie Ramsey, played alongside Otto in the final group and produced a round of 70 to end up alongside Joost Luiten (65) of the Netherlands in a share of fourth at 16 under.
