Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY SportsNFL    The San Francisco 49ers hoped to get a contract extension completed with wide receiver Michael Crabtree prior to the start of the regular season, but now that hopes looks to be dashed after no real progress has been made between the two parties.  According to Matt Maiocco of CSN Bay Area, his source tells him there has &ldquo;not really been any progress toward an extension&rdquo; for the former first round pick. In July 49ers general manager Trent Baalke told CSN Bay Area&rsquo;s Matt Maiocco, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work at it, certainly. But at some point, you got to stop negotiating deals and let these guys concentrate on playing football. I don&rsquo;t know what point that is. We&rsquo;ll make that determination as a club.&rdquo; With the season kicking off on Sunday for the 49ers, the time is running out to come to an agreement of risk losing him in free agency. Crabtree was limited to five regular season games last year after tearing his Achilles in the offseason and had 19 receptions for 284 yards and one touchdown. In 2012, Crabtree had career-highs with 85 receptions, 1105 yards and nine touchdowns. The 49ers recently relented and gave guard Alex Boone a new contract to end his prolonged holdout and get him back for the start of the regular season, and gave big extensions to quarterback to Colin Kaepernick and offensive tackle Joe Staley. San Francisco would also like to extend guard Mike Iupati and tight end Vernon Davis has been vocal about wanting a new deal as well.
