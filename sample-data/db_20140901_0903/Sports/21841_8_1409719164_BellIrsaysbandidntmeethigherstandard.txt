Bell: Irsay's ban didn't meet higher standard Bell: Irsay's ban didn't meet higher standard Six games?The penalty that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell imposed on embattled Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay — a six-game suspension and $500,000 fine — strikes me as a bit light.Given the serious nature of driving while impaired and the higher standard the league maintains that it must have for its owners and management figures, you would have thought Irsay would have at least been banned for a half-season.That would have ensured that Irsay — whose plea bargain for two misdemeanors resulted in a one-year probation after he was originally facing four felony charges for illegal possession of pain-killing medication — would have at least missed half the home games.As it turns out, Irsay gets a relative slap on the wrist.Sure, a half-million dollars is significant. It's the maximum amount Goodell could have fined Irsay, according to NFL bylaws, without other owners granting a special exemption.To an NFL owner, though, it is a drop in the bucket when considering their share of revenue from a business that generates more than $10 billion per year.Still, Goodell deserves credit for moving swiftly, announcing the decision just hours after Irsay's plea deal was finalized in an Indiana courtroom. He is clearing the decks of so many issues before the league kicks off its season Thursday night.That the discipline squares with the court's stipulation that Irsay must undergo drug testing is key. But it could have been stronger with an assurance that testing would continue after Irsay's one-year probation ends.Remember — higher standard. If a player hits Stage 3 of the drug program, he would be subject to random testing for the rest of his career. While this is Irsay's first offense under these conditions, a higher standard could be interpreted as testing that goes beyond the timing of the plea agreement.Compared to players who are subject to discipline after a DUI conviction, Irsay got it much tougher. That's why I don't suspect that Goodell won't get the type of intense backlash he received for issuing the two-game suspension on Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice for the domestic abuse issue.A first-time offense for a player, under current drug policy guidelines, would draw a one-game suspension and a $50,000 fine. So Irsay's fine is 10 times as much and the suspension six times as much. And his discipline is tougher than the 30-day suspension and $100,000 fine that Detroit Lions president Tom Lewand received following his guilty plea for DWI stemming from an arrest in 2010.It should be tougher. Higher standard.But Goodell did get it right by not punishing the Colts and taking away draft picks. This case wasn't about any issue that provided a competitive advantage on the field.But Irsay's discipline also includes a condition that in addition to being barred from granting interviews, he won't be allowed to engage on social media — which of course prevents Irsay from expressing himself as he loves to do on Twitter regarding team-related matters.Rather than banning his tweets, though, Goodell should have included a stipulation requiring Irsay perform community service.I'm suspecting that Irsay, who issued a statement Tuesday, may offer something on his own in this regard. Hopefully, he will have a full recovery and use his platform to provide an example for overcoming addition.After all, there's a higher standard to be measured by.***Follow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBellPHOTOS: NFL player suspensions in 2014
