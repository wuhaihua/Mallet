Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY SportsNBA    After spending four seasons in the Valley of the Sun, Channing Frye decided to get out of the boiling hot dessert and head to greener pastures in Orlando, Florida.  Multiple teams were interested in signing the veteran forward this offseason, though it was the Orlando Magic who made Channing Frye an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse. Now the Phoenix Suns are left to clean up the mess, though, it&rsquo;s difficult to suggest losing a bench player will have that large of an impact. Or is it? Frye, despite not cracking 44 percent shooting since his first season in Phoenix, had morphed into somewhat of a super-sub for the Phoenix Suns and the loss has Nate Duncan believing the team may feel regression over it. Phoenix is also a good regression candidate, as I think they are really going to miss Channing Frye. The veteran forward helped the Suns not only on the defensive end thanks to his long arms, but also on offense as his ability to hit from outside opened up the floor for Phoenix&rsquo;s lightning quick backcourt. Add in that Frye was an asset in the paint given Phoenix&rsquo;s lack of depth at the position> Of course, the Phoenix Suns offseason addition of Isaiah Thomas has now given the franchise additional trade assets as noted earlier today, so it&rsquo;s possible the team could eventually attempt to replicate what they lost in the former University of Arizona star.
