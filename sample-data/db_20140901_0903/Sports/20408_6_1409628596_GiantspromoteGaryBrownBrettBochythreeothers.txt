Giants promote Gary Brown, Brett Bochy, three others Giants promote Gary Brown, Brett Bochy, three others DENVER – Former first-round pick Gary Brown and right-hander Brett Bochy, son of manager Bruce Bochy, will highlight the second wave of September call-ups that will join the Giants on Tuesday.
Bochy will have his contract purchased from Triple-A Fresno, the team announced. The club also is purchasing the contract of right-handed starting pitcher Chris Heston, who posted a 2.05 ERA in eight starts after the All-Stark break.
They’ll provide coverage in the bullpen along with 28-year-old right-hander Erik Cordier, a former top prospect who will be making his major league debut after 11 minor league seasons in four organizations.
Cordier was recalled along with infielder Adam Duvall and Brown, who received his first big league call-up after hitting .271/.329/394 in his second full season for Triple-A Fresno. He added 40 points to his average from the previous season, when he had a disappointing .286 on-base percentage. He also boosted his stolen bases from 17 to 36, although he was caught 20 times.
Brown finished a single away from the cycle in Fresno’s season finale on Monday. The 25-year-old was the club’s top pick in 2010 out of Cal State Fullerton and set a record for Single-A San Jose with 188 hits in 2011, but got derailed by back-to-back subpar seasons.
The younger Bochy, a 20th-round pick in 2010 out of Kansas, posted a 3.57 ERA in 34 games (two starts), striking out 47 and walking 24 in 53 innings. He allowed a .263 average in the Pacific Coast League.
The Giants transferred Marco Scutaro and Matt Cain to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster for Bochy and Heston.
