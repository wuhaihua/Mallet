                    TEMPE, Ariz. &mdash; A person familiar with the contracts says Arizona State has agreed to extensions for men&#39;s basketball coach Herb Sendek and women&#39;s coach Charli Turner Thorne.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on Monday on condition of anonymity because the deals have not been announced.



Sendek&#39;s extension would run through the 2018-19 season. Turner Thorne&#39;s would go through 2017-18.

Both deals need to be approved by the Arizona Board of Regents.

Last season, Sendek led the Sun Devils to a 21-12 record and an NCAA tournament berth for the first time since 2009.

Turner Thorne led her team back to the NCAA tournament last season following a down year in 2012-13 and a sabbatical from the program the season before.
