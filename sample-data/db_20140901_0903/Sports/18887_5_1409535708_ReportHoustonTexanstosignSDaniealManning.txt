Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsNFL    To improve their secondary, the Houston Texans are expected to sign safety Danieal Manning. #Texans are expected to sign S Danieal Manning, pending physical. Would be important veteran addition with return to team. #NFL &mdash; Brian T. Smith (@ChronBrianSmith) August 31, 2014 According to Manning&rsquo;s agent, it was never the safeties intent to leave the Texans following the 2013 season.  &ldquo;It was just a situation where some things happened and I think both he and the team were looking at some things from a [different] view point,&rdquo; Hicks said. &ldquo;I think they both realize the best place for him was here.&rdquo; Manning then found himself a member of the Cincinatti Bengals, but was released as the franchise was forced to meet the 53-player roster limit. It&rsquo;s unclear what Manning&rsquo;s role will be with the Texans as Kendrick Lewis was projected to start the season at free safety, but Manning will add to an already impressive defense. Last season, the Texans finished seventh in overall team defense. With the addition of number one overall pick Jadaveon Clowney, who&rsquo;ll play alongside former Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt, and the re-addition of Manning, the unit will surely improve. In his career, Manning has collected 402 tackles (101 assisted), 11 interceptions,&nbsp;and 5 forced fumbles.
