                    Robert Griffin III is the only Baylor Bear to ever win the Heisman Trophy, and the quarterback&#39;s statue now stands on site at the school&#39;s brand new stadium.

Sunday&#39;s statue unveiling hours before the Bears&#39; season-opener against SMU featured&nbsp;plenty of pomp and circumstance.

Bears coach Art Briles is thankful after watching 45,140-seat McLane Stadium progress over the past nearly three years &mdash; from just a vision, to a rising steel-and-concrete frame along the Brazos River and now a reality.

For the Big 12 champion Bears, their focus is on what is most important &mdash; trying to debut with a victory on the field.&nbsp;&quot;We need to doggone make sure we protect our new house,&quot; Briles said.

The Bears will play on the Waco campus for the first time since 1935. They closed out 54 seasons at Floyd Casey Stadium, about 4 1/2 miles away, when they won their 10th consecutive game there last December, beating Texas to clinch their first Big 12 Conference title. But they finished the season with a Fiesta Bowl loss to UCF, which is in the American Athletic Conference with SMU.

&quot;Quite honestly, we&#39;ve got a bad taste in our mouth from last January,&quot; Briles said. &quot;What we&#39;re trying to do is take a wrong and make it right starting out in 2014.&quot;
