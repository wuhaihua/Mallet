                    BOWMANVILLE, Ontario &mdash; Ryan Blaney edged German Quiroga by 0.049 seconds to win the Truck Series race on the road course at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park Sunday.

The win Sunday was Blaney&#39;s first of the season, but third of his career.



Blaney and Quiroga drag-raced off the last corner to the finish line after Blaney made a pass in the final turn.

&quot;That was a ton of fun racing with German,&quot; said Blaney. &quot;We raced really, really hard and really clean and that&#39;s how racing should be. We had a problem last week (at Bristol) and just fate would have us racing each other for the win this week. That&#39;s awesome. That&#39;s what racing needs to be, it was so fun racing with him and battling it out with him.&quot;

It was Blaney&#39;s second win in a week &mdash; he won the Nationwide Series race at Bristol last week with a late pass of Kyle Busch.

This victory gave Brad Keselowski Racing its second consecutive victory as Keselowski won last week at Bristol driving the truck. Keselowski watched the thrilling finish on television in Atlanta, where he was preparing for Sunday night&#39;s Sprint Cup Series race.

&quot;Ryan and German put on an awesome show and a clinic of what racing should be,&quot; Keselowski said. &quot;I&#39;m just really proud of Ryan. I wouldn&#39;t have thought his first win of the year would have come on a road course, but that makes it even more exciting.&quot;

Quiroga settled for second.

&quot;We tried hard. I&#39;m going to keep on trying,&quot; he said.

Erik Jones was third and followed by Gray Gaulding and Andrew Ranger.
Truck Series points leader Johnny Sauter finished eighth and is seven points ahead of ThorSport Racing teammate Matt Crafton in the standings.
