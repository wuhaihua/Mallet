                    Under Armour went a non-traditional route with one of its recent viral ads, showcasing dancer Misty Copeland. (Her breathtaking video garnered more than 5.8 million views since its debut on July 30.)

Next up is another person you wouldn&#39;t necessarily associate with Under Armour: supermodel Gisele Bundchen.



Her full spot makes its debut on Sept. 4. Will Brady join her when the full clip drops, perhaps holding the punching bag?&nbsp;(Not joining Gisele in a UA ad: Kevin Durant.)
