			Trish Johnson made history on Sunday by becoming the oldest winner on the Ladies European Tour thanks to a two-stroke victory in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.The Bristol-born professional, who turns 49 in January, posted a closing one-over par 73 to fend off the challenge of Gwladys Nocera of France.It was her first win in four years and 19th of her career on the European Tour.Johnson, who began the 54-hole tournament at Archerfield Links with rounds of 66 and 70, posted a brace of birdies during her opening three holes in East Lothian to move six strokes clear of the field.However, she found trouble on the seventh where she hit her tee shot into a gorse bush and suffered a double-bogey six.Although she covered the final 15 holes in three over – there was also a bogey-five at 14 – Johnson held on to beat Nocera who covered the back nine in 33 shots for a 69.Scotland’s Sally Watson and Australian duo Rebecca Artis and Stephanie Na tied-for-third a further stroke back.A happy Johnson, who is also a three-time winner on the LPGA Tour, said: “I just didn’t putt as well as the first two days but I didn’t have the same mentality.“I suppose that was because I was defending a little bit, which I didn’t think I’d do.“I wasn’t expecting this. I had very low expectations and I guess that worked for me. I didn’t have a practise round and I didn’t play until Friday morning and probably played one of the best rounds of my life on Friday. I’m chuffed to bits.”Leading 10 Finishers:209: Trish Johnson (Eng) 73211: Gwladys Nocera (Fra) 69212: Sally Watson (Sco) 70212: Rebecca Artis (Aus) 66212: Stephanie Na (Aus) 67214: Anne-Lise Caudal (Fra) 71216: Margherita Rigon (Ita) 68216: Nikki Campbell (Aus) 68217: Liz Young (Eng) 68218: Ann-Kathrin Lindner (Ger) 73
