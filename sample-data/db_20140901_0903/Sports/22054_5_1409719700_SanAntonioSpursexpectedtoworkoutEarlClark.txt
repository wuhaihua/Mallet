Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY SportsNBA Free Agency    After yet another NBA title, the San Antonio Spurs aren&rsquo;t in desperate need for improvement though they seem to be interested in reinforcing their front line.  Over the past few weeks rumors have come out suggesting that the Spurs are showing interest in a handful of available free agent big men, though they team has yet to find one they&rsquo;re happy with. Might that be Earl Clark? The veteran big most recently spent time with the New York Knicks and is expected to work out with the San Antonio Spurs later this week according to Sporting News. Free-agent forward Earl Clark, who followed up a breakthrough year with the Lakers by bouncing between the Cavaliers and Knicks last year, will be working out this week for the defending champion Spurs, a source told Sporting News. Clark is in San Antonio today and will be there through Wednesday. It was a bit odd to see Earl Clark play so well for the Lakers and seemingly fall of the map before he resurfaced with the Knicks last year. The San Antonio still has their full mid-level exception available, though it&rsquo;s doubtful they&rsquo;d offer Clark anything more than the league minimum if they were appeased with what they see during his work out. Clark, who put up over 7 points and 5 rebounds with the Lakers in 2012-13 left Southern California in free agency to join the Cleveland Cavaliers, though was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers after disappointing on his new deal. Philadelphia then released Clark before he signed two ten-day contracts with the Knicks.
