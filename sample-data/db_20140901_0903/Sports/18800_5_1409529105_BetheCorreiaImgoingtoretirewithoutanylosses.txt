Bethe Correia: I'm going to retire without any losses Bethe Correia: I'm going to retire without any losses August 30, 2014; Sacramento, CA, USA; Bethe Correia (red gloves) reacts after defeating Shayna Baszler (blue gloves) during the women s bantamweight bout of UFC 177 at Sleep Train Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY SportsMMA    Bethe Correia, strange dancing and all, was victorious for the third straight occasion inside the Octagon with a second round TKO over Shayna Baszler. After defeating two of the &lsquo;Four Horsewomen&rsquo;, the Brazilian is now coming after the ringleader of them all, UFC women&rsquo;s bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey. Like Rousey, Correia is undefeated as a professional and has entered the Octagon with coarse words for her opponents. Both fighters are eager to face one another next, but UFC president Dana White has stated that his plans will go in a different direction. While this rivalry is hot, the UFC should book the bout as quickly as possible; an unbeaten Brazilian who has beaten two of Rousey&rsquo;s closest friends, fighting an unbeaten Olympian for the title &ndash; what&rsquo;s not to love? Cat Zingano, Holly Holm and Rin Nakai are all in the mix, but there is a lot of time to schedule those fights; the Correia-Rousey rivalry can&rsquo;t wait. Speaking after her win (per Sherdog), Correia had some clear words for the champion. &ldquo;My message to Ronda: If there&rsquo;s someone who will retire without any losses in the UFC, it&rsquo;s going to be me. I&rsquo;m going to retire with the belt, not her,&rdquo; The unbeaten prospect was happy with her performance, taking out a respected veteran in Shayna Baszler after arguably losing the first round. She is now 3-0 inside the UFC, and is expected to move up the ladder at 135lbs. &ldquo;A lot of people were saying that I fight for points, but I wanted to go in there and show that I can finish fights,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have a chance at the title. I&rsquo;d love to be champion. I have three fights in the UFC; I&rsquo;m undefeated right now. I feel that if I had the chance for the title I&rsquo;d make the most of it.&rdquo; Despite the comments of Correia and Rousey&rsquo;s aggressive response, Dana White wanted to stay patient on the potential match-up. &ldquo;You know Ronda, as soon as [Correia] started talking, Ronda texted me and said, &lsquo;I want that fight. I want it now. I want it before somebody else beats her,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Calm down lady. You&rsquo;ve got other people to fight.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll figure it out. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long list for Rousey waiting right now. We&rsquo;ll see what happens. [Correia's] on the list.&rdquo;
