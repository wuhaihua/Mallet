			Colin Montgomerie continued his superb form on the European Senior Tour as he strolled to a 10-shot victory in the Travis Perkins Masters at Woburn Golf Club.The Scot started the third and final round with a four-shot advantage over American Mike Cunning and it looked set to be a close contest in the early stages.In fact there were only two shots between the pair when Montgomerie bogeyed the third hole and Cunning drained a birdie at the fifth.However, Montgomerie birdied the sixth and then pulled further and further clear, eventually signing for a five-under 67 which left him on 12-under 204 for the tournament.Austrian Gordon Manson (67), Switzerland’s Andre Bossert (71) and American Tim Thelen (71) shared second place back on two under.Cunning (74) finished in a tie for fifth with Peter Fowler of Australia (72) on one under.Montgomerie claimed his maiden Senior Tour victory at Woburn last year – by six shots – and he has now won four Senior Tour events after also winning the US Senior PGA Championship and US Senior Open this year.He told the European Tour’s official website: “I’m delighted to come back here and successfully defend this great title.“It probably looks pretty comfortable, and in the end it was, but Mike managed to get to within two shots and it could easily have been one shot at one point. I didn’t start that well, but I made a birdie on the sixth hole and then I just started moving away really.”
