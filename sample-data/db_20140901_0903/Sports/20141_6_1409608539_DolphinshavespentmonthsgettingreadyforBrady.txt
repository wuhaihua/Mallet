Dolphins have spent months getting ready for Brady Dolphins have spent months getting ready for Brady September 1, 2014, 5:00 pm In drawing the Patriots and Tom Brady for the opener, Kevin Coyle knows his defense is in for a ridiculous challenge on Sunday.
But the Dolphins defensive coordinator hasn’t hung around as a coach this long -- in the business since 1978 -- by thinking he’s about to get his ass kicked.
“The fact that it is Week 1, we’ve known this since the spring and you’re always able to spend more time on your first opponent,” Coyle said Monday after the Dolphins practiced. “That goes back to spring. Certain things that we worked on and certain things that we exposed [our players] to, I think they have a better feeling now than they would have if this was game five or six during the regular season.”
Flip side?
“Because there is the degree of unknown, you’ve got to be careful how many new things you are going to do because you are not sure exactly what you might be getting and you spend time on things that you might not see,” Coyle explained. “On the other hand, I think the fact that we’ve had more time is a good thing for us and we’re excited about that. We are excited about playing them here at home in front of our home crowd and the great fans we have here in South Florida. I think it’s a good opener for us.”
Coyle knows that in order to have a shot, the Dolphins will have to disguise, disguise, disguise.
“I think Brady is very intelligent," he said. "I think they do a great job of preparing him as well as a coaching staff, so I think there’s that element of when he knows exactly what he thinks you are going to be doing in certain down and distances or in certain alignments and things, he can make throws that most other guys in the league can’t. He can get the ball into very, very tight windows. You have to try to do some things to keep him off balance. That’s a combination of things. If it was one answer, everybody would be trying to do it.
“You’ve got to be able to make him uncomfortable in the pocket and you can do that by getting great rush on him, occasionally trying to pressure and things of that nature, trying to give looks that maybe he’s not certain what you’re in, all those types of things,” Coyle added. “When you play this type of caliber quarterback and there’s just a handful of them in the league, they can beat you with their arms and also with their brain because they can anticipate where you are going to be, get themselves into the proper play and it makes it very difficult in addition to just defending the talent that he has around him. It’s a great challenge, but we welcome the challenge and it’s something that we’re very excited about come Sunday.”
