                    Taking no chances with their lead in the American League East, the Baltimore Orioles shored up their roster with the acquisition of veteran infielder Kelly Johnson.

It was one of two deals by the O&#39;s on Saturday. In the other, they acquired outfielder Alejandro De Aza. They traded away four minor leaguers. They also got Michael Almanzar in the Johnson deal from the Boston Red Sox.

The deals also look forward to the postseason, since they came before Sunday&#39;s deadline for players to be eligible.

Johnson will help the Orioles plug a hole at third base, which is a chasm because stalwart Manny Machado is out for the season. In no way will Johnson replace Machado&#39;s hitting, but he does offer a defensive patch. He also could help at his natural position, second base. But he is mired in a season to forget, hitting .219.

A left-handed hitter, Johnson hasn&#39;t played since Aug. 21. He was dead weight with the Sox, who are on the first of going from World Series champions to worst in the AL.

&quot;It&#39;s crazy. Obviously I&#39;ll be familiar with the surroundings,&quot; Johnson said after learning of the trade. &quot;I&#39;m excited to get there and try to contribute to the team for the rest of the year.&quot;

Johnson will report to the Orioles on Monday, according to CSN Baltimore. Although he missed his flight from Chicago, De Aza joined the team in time for Sunday&#39;s game.

Saturday&#39;s trades saw the O&#39;s part with two minor league pitchers, Mark Blackmar and Miguel Chalas and two minor league infielders, Ivan De Jesus, Jr. and Jemile Weeks.

&quot;This is why we do this, right?&quot; Duquette told CSN Baltimore. &quot;We have the players in our minor league system to be able to make these trades to add to the ballclub in a pennant race.&quot;

The O&#39;s needed to balance their bench with left-handed hitters. Johnson and De Aza could help.
