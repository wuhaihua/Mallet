Matt hits the Sox Matt hits the Sox September 1, 2014, 4:45 pm ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Matt Joyce lofted a bases-loaded single to left, scoring pinch-runner Sean Rodriguez from third and giving Tampa Bay a 4-3, 10-inning victory over the Red Sox at Tropicana Field on Monday and earning the Rays a split of the four-game series.
With Burke Badenhop pitching for the Sox, Ryan Hanigan led off the 10th with a double to left, just sliding into second ahead of a strong throw from Yoenis Cespedes. After an intentional walk to Kevin Kiermaier, Ben Zobrist dropped down a sacrifice bunt that moved both baserunners over.
Wil Myers was given the second intentional walk of the inning, loading the bases and setting the stage for Joyce.
Cespdes had forged the tie in the top of the eighth inning when he singled to center with two outs off Rays reliever Steve Geltz, scoring Mookie Betts -- who had singled and advanced to second on a swinging bunt by Brock Holt -- with the game-tying run.
Starter Rubby De La Rosa, whose starts have often fallen into either the very good or very bad category, was in-between on Monday, allowing three runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings.
All three runs came in the third inning, immediately after the Red Sox had given him the lead in the top of the inning. Wil Myers singled home run and Evan Longoria doubled to produce two more.
On the positive side, De La Rosa didn't issue a single walk, a step forward after walking three or more in four of his previous five starts.
Boston pulled within a run in the fourth off Rays starter Drew Smyly, when Mike Napoli homered to left for his 17th home run of the season.
The Red Sox had scored first with their first hit -- a booming double to left-center by Betts that scored Christian Vazquez (walk) all the way from first.  ST.
