Bopanna-Katarina sail into mixed doubles quarters at US Open Bopanna-Katarina sail into mixed doubles quarters at US Open 
										
		India's Rohan Bopanna and his Slovenian partner Katarina Srebotnik sailed into the US Open mixed doubles quarterfinals after a comprehensive straight-set win in their second-round match.
Sixth-seeded Bopanna and Srebotnik defeated the Spanish-South African pairing of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Raven Klaasen 6-3 6-4 in a contest which lasted an hour and five minutes.

Therefore, the quarterfinal will have an Indian on both ends of the court as Bopanna and Srebotnik will square off against top seeds Sania Mirza and her Brazillian partner Bruno Soares.
In a rather lop-sided match, Bopanna and Srebotnik took merely half an hour to clinch the opening set after converting two of the three break points they earned.
The Indo-Slovenian team had a markedly better second serve percentage and the pair sent down 10 winners against its rival's five.
The second set was a tad more competitive but Bopanna Srebotnik were still the better of the two combinations. They once again broke Garrigues and Klaasen twice to seal the issue in their favour.
