                    OAKLAND, Calif. &mdash; James Paxton pounded the strike zone to induce ground balls, and his defense dazzled behind him.

Paxton carried a shutout into the eighth inning and the Seattle&nbsp;Mariners&nbsp;held off a late rally by Oakland for a 6-5 win Tuesday night, handing the Athletics their fifth loss in six games.

&quot;This young man&#39;s got greatness written all over him, he&#39;s just got to stay healthy,&quot; manager Lloyd McClendon said. &quot;I thought it was a dominant performance.&quot;

Paxton (5-1) gave up three hits through the seventh. Ahead 6-0, he was chased in Oakland&#39;s three-run eighth, and the A&#39;s nearly got even in a harried ninth.

Seattle closer Fernando Rodney took over with a 6-3 lead and retired the first two batters. He then gave up consecutive doubles to Derek Norris and pinch-hitters Brandon Moss and Sam Fuld before retiring Josh Reddick on a grounder for his 40th save.

The A&#39;s remained 4 1/2 games back of the first-place Angels, who lost at Houston. Seattle is third in the AL wild-card standings.

Oakland didn&#39;t seem too concerned afterward.

&quot;No matter what inning you score in, it was a one-run game. We&#39;re one swing of the bat away from winning it,&quot; Norris said. &quot;They didn&#39;t score for seven innings either. That&#39;s why you play all nine innings.&quot;

The rubber game Wednesday afternoon between the division rivals and playoff contenders has the makings of quite a pitcher&#39;s duel. In a matchup of 13-game winners, Seattle ace Felix Hernandez faces Jon Lester.

Paxton allowed two runs and four hits in 7 2-3 innings. He improved to 8-1 with a 1.77 ERA in 12 career starts.

&quot;I was just going at them with my fastball. They weren&#39;t making the adjustment and they were hitting groundballs and hitting it right at guys, so I just kept on pounding away,&quot; Paxton said. &quot;They got themselves out.&quot;

Sonny Gray (13-8) gave up six runs and seven hits in five innings. He is 1-5 in seven outings since his 5-0 July earned him the AL Pitcher of the Month award. Gray came in 4-0 with a 1.10 ERA in his first five starts against the&nbsp;Mariners.

&quot;I thought he pitched better than the numbers would suggest,&quot; manager Bob Melvin said.

Kyle Seager hit a two-run homer that helped the&nbsp;Mariners&nbsp;build a 6-0 lead.

A day after hitting a home run in his first at-bat since joining the A&#39;s, Adam Dunn had an RBI single as a pinch-hitter in the eighth to put Oakland on the board. Craig Gentry added a two-run double for his third hit.

Endy Chavez hit a two-run double in the fourth that slowly chopped through the middle of the infield. With second baseman Alberto Callaspo in shallow center trying to make a play, shortstop Jed Lowrie was late moving toward the bag and Chavez had already begun sliding into second and no throw was made.

Austin Jackson hit a two-run single in the third. Seager homered in the fifth, Gray&#39;s final inning.

&quot;He&#39;s definitely one of those guys you have your hands full with,&quot; Seager said.
