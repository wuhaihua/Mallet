Weeks picked off by Balfour in Red Sox debut Weeks picked off by Balfour in Red Sox debut September 1, 2014, 8:15 pm ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Jemile Weeks won't soon forget his Red Sox debut. It was ugly and short.
Weeks, obtained late Friday night in a four-player deal with Baltimore, was picked up for infield depth and speed on the bases.
The Sox tried to put that speed to good use in the top of the 10th inning after Christian Vazquez singled to leadoff. Weeks was inserted as a pinch-runner, representing the potential go-ahead run.
But after getting back safely on Tampa Bay reliever Grant Balfour's first throw over, he got caught leaning the wrong way and was picked off on the second attempt.
"One of his strengths is his speed,'' said John Farrell. "He's got a track record for being able to steal a base.  (Getting picked off was) untimely, for sure."
Weeks was a teammate of Balfour's in Oakland and knew from experience that the veteran reliever had a habit of throwing over only once.
"I was going to make an attempt to go," said Weeks. "Percentages show that he wasn't going to pick again, so we were kind of leaning toward going at that moment."
And at that moment, Balfour defied expectations and threw over, just as Weeks began to lean into his secondary lead.
"You play the percentages," offered Weeks, "and he broke the percentages that time. I tried to get back and I didn't make it. He kind of (threw over) at the right moment. Like I said, percentages showed that he wasn't going to (pick a second time). I probably should have gone off instinct rather than the numbers. He did his job."
In this instance, being Balfour's former teammate was a case of too much knowledge being a bad thing.
"In that situation," said Weeks, "it probably hurt me because he knows that at some point, he knew I was going to go. So he did what he doesn't usually do."
Either way, it was an empty feeling for Weeks given it was his introduction to the team and came at a critical time.
"It's definitely not a good feeling," he acknowledged. "It's not the feeling you want. But I think the staff and everybody knows we played the percentages there and he went against the percentages there.
"It's not a good feeling. But you've got to get up and be ready to play again tomorrow."  ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Jemile Weeks won't soon forget his Red Sox debut. It was ugly and short.
