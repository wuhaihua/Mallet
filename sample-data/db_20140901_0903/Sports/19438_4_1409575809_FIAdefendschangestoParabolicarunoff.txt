FIA defends changes to Parabolica run-off FIA defends changes to Parabolica run-off 
The FIA has defended its decision to tarmac over much of the Parabolica run-off at Monza ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix.
The gravel trap has punished many drivers over the past, but that is set to change as a large area is now tarmac, allowing a driver to simply rejoin the track if they make a mistake.
FIA race director Charlie Whiting believes that's a good thing and says the change was done for safety reasons which he believes outweighs that of the need to punish a driver.
"About 35 per cent of the gravel has been replaced," explained Whiting.
"This has been requested for safety reasons by the FIA and the drivers, just as it has been at virtually every other circuit that F1 races on.
"Of course we know that it is not as punishing to a driver who leaves the track but that is the price that we pay for much improved safety: a price both the drivers and I believe is worth paying."
Lotus driver's Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado have also publicly supported the change.
