                    A quick turnaround after a historic night at Flushing Meadows;&nbsp;that&#39;s the early theme of&nbsp;Day 9 at the U.S. Open.

Tuesday&#39;s play will begin at the usual 11 a.m. New York time, but just 8 1/2 hours after men&#39;s 10th seed&nbsp;Kei Nishikori defeated fifth seed Milos Raonic in a five-set thriller. The match lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes and ended at 2:26 a.m., tying for the latest finish in tournament history.



Most impressive was that Nishikori&nbsp;was playing on a tender right big toe that was severely infected not long ago.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting (a) big result like this, but after the first round I get more confidence on my foot. It&#39;s all good now,&quot; he said.

Nishikori will take on third seed Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals&nbsp;Wednesday.

The men&#39;s fourth round will conclude Tuesday.&nbsp;No. 2 seed Roger Federer will play at night&nbsp;vs. No. 17 Roberto Bautista Agut. The other matches: No. 6 Tomas Berdych vs. Dominic Thiem, No. 7 Grigor Dimitrov vs. No. 20 Gael Monfils, and No. 14 Marin Cilic vs. No. 26 Gilles Simon.

Federer is wary&nbsp;of Bautista Agut, who has won on clay and grass this year.

&quot;He&#39;s quick on his feet. He doesn&#39;t miss much. He&#39;s consistent. He&#39;s got a pretty good first serve. He&#39;s overall a solid player,&quot; Federer told reporters.&nbsp;&quot;I would assume he&#39;s fit, too, because he comes from the Spanish tennis school. ... They just know how to train hard. They never get tired. They&#39;re always ready to go. They have a good mental approach, point-for-point mentality.&quot;

The women&#39;s quarterfinals get under way Tuesday with a pair of matches: 10th seed Caroline Wozniacki vs. No. 13 Sara Errani in the evening session, and Belinda Bencic vs. Peng Shuai in a meeting of unseeded players.

Wozniacki is just one of two women seeded in the top 10 still playing. The other is No. 1 seed Serena Williams, who won Monday.&nbsp;No. 7 Eugenie Bouchard became the latest upset victim when she&nbsp;fell to No. 17 Ekaterina Makarova in Round 4.

A run beyond the quarters would be a big&nbsp;accomplishment for Wozniacki, whose game has picked up this summer&nbsp;after an understandable lull. It wasn&#39;t that long ago that golfer Rory McIlroy abruptly broke&nbsp;off their engagement.

After early exits from&nbsp;the French Open and Wimbledon, Wozniacki rebounded with a win in Istanbul and a pair of tough three-setters (both losses) vs. Williams. She&#39;s coming off a hard-fought,&nbsp;fourth-round victory over No. 5 seed Maria Sharapova.

&quot;The season for me has been a little bit up and down,&quot; she told reporters after beating Sharapova,&nbsp;&quot;and it&#39;s so nice to kind of start feeling like I&#39;m playing the way I want to.&quot;

Last week, Errani silenced naysayers by beating&nbsp;Venus Williams in the third round. Errani used her not-powerful&nbsp;serve, which former player Brad Gilbert described as&nbsp;&quot;cottage cheese,&quot; to great effect.

&quot;I know (people) say my serve is terrible, but it helped me get to where I&#39;ve been,&quot;&nbsp;Errani&nbsp;said Friday after beating Williams. &quot;It&#39;s not easy to improve it. It&#39;s definitely one of my weak points, but today it helped me.&quot;

Tuesday&#39;s other women&#39;s quarterfinal features the 17-year-old Bencic, who a year ago at the Open&nbsp;was playing (and losing) in the junior tournament.

This year, Bencic has beaten three seeded players &mdash; No. 6 Angelique Kerber, No. 9 Jelena Jankovic and&nbsp;No. 31 Kurumi Nara &mdash; en route to becoming&nbsp;the youngest quarterfinalist at Flushing Meadows since another player from Switzerland, Martina Hingis, was 16 in 1997. As it happens, Hingis is a mentor to Bencic, who is coached by Hingis&#39; mother, Melanie Molitor.

&quot;She&#39;s come a long way. I don&#39;t have to tell her that much. It&#39;s my mom who has done great work,&quot; Hingis told reporters.
