Schaub injury gave team excuse to go with Derek Carr Schaub injury gave team excuse to go with Derek Carr Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY SportsNFL    There is a simple bit of wisdom when it comes to quarterback situations that involve a veteran and a rookie who has been dubbed the &ldquo;franchise quarterback&rdquo;: you can always start the veteran and then switch to the rookie, but it is a whole lot more complicated to start the rookie and then try to switch to the veteran mid-season.  That philosophy may or may not explain why teams like the Minnesota Vikings, Cleveland Browns, and Jacksonville Jaguars are all opting for a lower-upside veteran option at quarterback to start the 2014 season instead of a rookie drafted this past April. The Raiders stared down a similar decision with Matt Schaub and Derek Carr. On Monday they announced that it would be Carr and not Schaub starting week 1, but it might be that they had a buffer for that decision. As passed along by Chris Wesseling, Ian Rapoport offered the following tidbit about the Raiders, a recent injury to Schaub&rsquo;s elbow, and their decision with Carr. From @RapSheet on Total Access: Schaub&rsquo;s elbow &ldquo;gives the Raiders cover&rdquo; for what they wanted to do anyway: Give the job to Carr. &mdash; Chris Wesseling (@ChrisWesseling) September 1, 2014 It is conceivable, then, that if Carr struggles the Raiders could go back to Schaub and cite improved health as the reason for the decision. If they truly wanted to get a look at Carr right away as their next franchise guy, that is something they can now do as they look at a season in which playoff contention is a long shot.
