Wozniacki wallops Errani to reach US Open semi-finals Wozniacki wallops Errani to reach US Open semi-finals 
										
		Caroline Wozniacki used her aggressive groundstroke game to near perfection on Tuesday to reach the semi-finals of the U.S. Open with a 6-0 6-1 victory over Italy's Sara Errani.
The 10th-seeded Dane beat 13th-seeded Errani at her own strategy, engaging in long baseline rallies but using superior power to open the court and find lanes for blasting home winners.

Former world number one Wozniacki belted 15 winners to four for Errani in the first set and, despite losing serve in the opening game of the second set, roared to victory in a brisk 65 minutes at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Wozniacki's opponent in the semi-finals will be Peng Shuai of China, a 6-2 6-1 winner over 17-year-old Swiss Belinda Bencic.
