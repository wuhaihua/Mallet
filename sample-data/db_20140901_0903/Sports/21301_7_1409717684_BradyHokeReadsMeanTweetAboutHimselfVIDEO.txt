Jimmy Kimmel came up with a brilliant idea of celebrities reading mean tweets about themselves.
The first time I saw the clips I was instantly hooked. Jeff Riger and I did the Jimmy Kimmel treatment to Joe Nathan last week &#8212; and hilarity ensued. He was a good sport.
Catching on to the trend, ESPN&#8217;s College Gameday had popular college coaches read mean tweets about themselves including Alabama&#8217;s Nick Saban, Florida&#8217;s Will Muschamp and Michigan&#8217;s own Brady Hoke.
I really do wonder if Hoke&#8217;s cologne smells like hot dog water?
