MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) &#8212; Nothing like evaluating quarterback play…and the Gopher football team is no exception. 
Mitch Leidner is the man, but is he ready? 
When he played at Lakeville South High School, you could see he was an athlete. It wasn’t sure if he’d play quarterback in college, but the Gophers recruited him as a tight end. 
But they recognized he had an upside, and now they hope the season’s first game was a first step to his becoming a game-winning quarterback.
&#8220;We know what Mitch can do,&#8221; said Gopher coach Jerry Kill. &#8220;We just got to continue…playing games.&#8221;
Inside the program, it’s said the defense has never been better. The team also thinks it has pretty good running backs and receivers.  
In other words, success for this Gopher squad might come down to Leidner’s poise in the pocket. If he has it, this team might be the best that Kill has had.  
But to develop that might take time. And as for Leidner, that’s what he says he needs.
