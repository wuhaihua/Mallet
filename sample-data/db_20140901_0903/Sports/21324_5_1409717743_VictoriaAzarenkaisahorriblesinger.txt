Victoria Azarenka is a horrible singer Victoria Azarenka is a horrible singer Sep 1, 2014; New York, NY, USA; Victoria Azarenka (BLR) celebrates after recording match point against Aleksandra Krunic (SRB) on day eight of the 2014 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerry Lai-USA TODAY SportsUS Open    Victoria Azarenka. Fine tennis player. Attractive young lady. Friend of humans and animals alike, probably.  Not much of a singer though.  As the crowd at the U.S. Open discovered Monday, much to their shock and dismay. It was truly horrific and offensive to the ears. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything like it since the last time I woke up to the noise of a cat puking beside the bed. Hear it for yourself, but you might want to listen to your children laugh one last time first.   Lovely as it was for Victoria to want to serenade her pal Gael Monfils on his birthday, she should have taken her own vocal limitations into account. She ain&rsquo;t exactly Marilyn Monroe purring Happy Birthday for John F. Kennedy. If I had to compare Victoria Azarenka&rsquo;s singing voice to another sound, I&rsquo;d call it a combination of a snoring goat and a wheezing car engine. With a little Carl Lewis thrown in. It&rsquo;s not often that I advocate for the use of Autotune, but this is one instance where I wish the technology had been available. It helps Taylor Swift, it can help Victoria Azarenka. Maybe. A Bane mask would also have aided Azarenka. Can someone do a Bane remix of Azarenka trying to sing? That would be funny.
