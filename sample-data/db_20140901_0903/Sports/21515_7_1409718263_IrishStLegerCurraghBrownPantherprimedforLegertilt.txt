								Irish St Leger Curragh: Brown Panther primed for Leger tilt
							
						
					
				
			
			Brown Panther is being primed to go on a retrieval mission in the E300,000 Palmerstown House Estate Irish St Leger at the Curragh on September 14.Two years ago, the Tom Dascombe-trained stayer was agonisingly beaten a head and a short head in third place behind Royal Diamond and Massiyn but missed the Classic last season after spiking a temperature.Connections of the six-year-old, who was bred by co-owner Michael Owen, have targeted a second crack at this race since he finished third to Cavalryman in the Goodwood Cup."He seems fine and this race has been the plan since Goodwood," said Dascombe."We gave him a nice break after he last ran, but he seems to be in great shape again now."He can handle all types of ground so we'll take whatever he gets. He is ready and he will come over."Roger Varian is aiming Cursory Glance at Group One honours in the E300,000 Moyglare Stud Stakes on the same card.The talented two-year-old filly, winner of Royal Ascot's Albany Stakes and second in the Lowther at York, will be attempting seven furlongs for the first time."The Moyglare Stud Stakes is the plan for Cursory Glance. She has trained nicely since York, where she shaped as though the step up to seven furlongs would bring about further improvement," said the Newmarket trainer."Her win at Royal Ascot in the Albany Stakes and her second to Tiggy Wiggy in the Lowther represents some of the strongest juvenile form around and she deserves to have a crack at a Group One."
