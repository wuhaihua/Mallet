Wrangling continues ahead of Boxing India polls Wrangling continues ahead of Boxing India polls 
										
		The long-pending elections to form&nbsp;a new Indian Boxing Federation have run into rough weather yet&nbsp;again with Rakesh Thakran, a contestant for the Secretary&nbsp;General's post, demanding the rejection of his rival Jay&nbsp;Kowli's nomination papers on technical grounds.
Thakran, who represents the Haryana State Boxing&nbsp;Association, claims that Kowli's nomination papers cannot&nbsp;stand scrutiny as his candidature has been seconded by the&nbsp;same man, who has acted as a proposer for two other&nbsp;candidates.
As per rules, a person, in this case Bharatkumar Whaval&nbsp;from the Maharashtra Boxing Association, cannot be both a&nbsp;proposer and seconder for different candidates.

Thakran has already written to the Returning Officer,&nbsp;Retired Justice D K Deshmukh, demanding the cancellation of&nbsp;Kowli's nomination along with Hiren Pandit and Amarjit Singh.
Thakran has alleged that Pandit and Singh's names were&nbsp;proposed by Whaval. While Pandit is contesting for the&nbsp;vice-president's post, Singh is aiming for a place in the&nbsp;Executive Council.
The last date for filing nominations for the September 11&nbsp;polls has been set at September 6.
The elections, being conducted by the provisionally&nbsp;recognised Boxing India (BI), have been mired in controversy. The voting was initially scheduled to be held on July 9 but&nbsp;was postponed by BI, citing a directive from the International&nbsp;Boxing Association.
BI itself is coping quite a bit of resentment from the&nbsp;state associations, some of which have stated that the&nbsp;AIBA-recognised body is trying to manipulate the polls to get&nbsp;its favoured candidates elected.
The national federation was terminated in December 2012&nbsp;by AIBA on charges of "possible manipulation" in elections. &nbsp;Federation was officially terminated in March this year and&nbsp;AIBA recognised BI as the provisional body entrusted with the&nbsp;task of conducting fresh elections.
