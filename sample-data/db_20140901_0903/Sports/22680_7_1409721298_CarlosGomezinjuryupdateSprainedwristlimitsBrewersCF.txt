                    Not what the Brewers need&nbsp;as they compete for a playoff spot: Center fielder Carlos Gomez will be limited &nbsp;to pinch-hitting and pinch-running duties for at least&nbsp;the next week because of&nbsp;a sprained left wrist.

Gomez was injured on a swing&nbsp;Sunday against the Giants. He was not in the lineup Monday or Tuesday against the Cubs. Former Diamondbacks center fielder&nbsp;Gerardo Parra started in his place both days.

Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said Gomez&#39;s recovery is &quot;going to take some time&quot; and might last two weeks.&nbsp;With rosters now expanded, Gomez won&#39;t need to go on the disabled list.

Gomez is batting .281 with 21 home runs and 29 stolen bases this season.

Milwaukee suffered a seventh consecutive loss Tuesday night in Chicago. The Brewers now trail the first-place Cardinals by two games in the NL Central.
