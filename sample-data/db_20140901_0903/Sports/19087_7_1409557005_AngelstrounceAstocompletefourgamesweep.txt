                    ANAHEIM, Calif. &mdash; While the Los&nbsp;Angeles&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;buzzed around their clubhouse preparing for their fantasy football draft, the Oakland Athletics had their own doors locked for a grim team meeting.

California&#39;s AL West powers are headed into September in very different moods after the&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;seized control of the division race in one remarkable weekend.



Mike Trout hit his career-high 31st homer and drove in three runs, Matt Shoemaker pitched seven shutout innings of five-hit ball, and the&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;completed a masterful four-game sweep of the A&#39;s with an 8-1 victory Sunday.

&quot;That was a huge series for us in regards the playoffs and the AL West, a huge series,&quot; said Shoemaker (14-4), who got his sixth win in August. &quot;I just wanted to keep it going.&quot;

Chris Iannetta also homered and had three hits for the&nbsp;Angels, who took a five-game lead in the division standings with the best record in the majors at 83-53. Outpitching the A&#39;s vaunted staff and outhitting Oakland&#39;s usually productive lineup, Los&nbsp;Angeles&nbsp;outscored the A&#39;s 18-4 in the four-game set.

&quot;We&#39;re having fun and we&#39;re winning ballgames, but it&#39;s still August,&quot; Trout said before grabbing his Philadelphia Eagles helmet out of his locker and threatening to wear it to the draft. &quot;Can&#39;t get too excited yet.&quot;

Still, it&#39;s tough for the&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;not to get a little bit stoked by their surge, which includes a six-game winning streak. They shut out the A&#39;s for the 29 consecutive innings during the series, and their sellout crowd loudly chanted &quot;Sweep! Sweep!&quot; as the&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;finished it off.

Trout had a two-run single during a six-run second inning for Los&nbsp;Angeles, which has won 15 of 19. The A&#39;s have lost 14 of 20.

&quot;It was embarrassing. Pathetic,&quot; said A&#39;s manager Bob Melvin, who was ejected in the second inning. &quot;We don&#39;t play like that. The last three games here were the worst I&#39;ve seen this team play in I can&#39;t remember how long. I feel bad for our fans to have to watch that.&quot;

Scott Kazmir (14-7) got just four outs for the A&#39;s, and he criticized home plate umpire Gerry Davis afterward. Kazmir also claimed Davis had been reprimanded by baseball officials for making a &quot;cry-baby face&quot; at the Oakland dugout Saturday.

Major League Baseball said it had no comment on Kazmir&#39;s assertion.

&quot;It&#39;s important to rise above any personal issue and call a fair game,&quot; Kazmir said. &quot;We owe it to the game to do that. We really do. And what I saw from the video, I saw 10-plus pitches that I thought were right there. I don&#39;t know if it has something to do with last night and how he got reprimanded or anything like that, but the professionalism is something that I have an issue with.

&quot;No matter what happens on the field, some things are just unacceptable. When you constantly pitch inside and hit your spot every single time and have nothing to show for it, it&#39;s frustrating,&quot; he said.

Oakland, which led the AL West for nearly four straight months this season, now faces its biggest division deficit since May 25, 2013.

&quot;I definitely think something needed to be said,&quot; Josh Donaldson said of the A&#39;s closed-door meeting. &quot;This is the time of the season where you need to start playing your best. And right now, we&#39;re playing our worst.&quot;

Gordon Beckham and Kole Calhoun drew bases-loaded walks in the second from Kazmir, who matched his shortest start of the season. After Kazmir issued three straight walks and got the hook, Melvin was tossed for arguing with Davis.

After eight&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;relievers pitched a three-hit shutout Saturday night, Shoemaker (14-4) provided the bullpen with plenty of rest. The rookie right-hander capped a tremendous month by striking out seven and extending his personal scoreless innings streak to 23 1-3 innings while allowing no Oakland runners to reach third base.

TRAINER&#39;S ROOM

Athletics: CF Coco Crisp sat out again after his wall collision Friday.

Angels: INF Grant Green came off the disabled list after missing 37 games with a lumbar strain.

UP NEXT

Athletics: Jason Hammel (1-5, 5.77) opens a series with Seattle at the Coliseum on Monday night. Dunn should be available.

Angels: After Labor Day off, Hector Santiago (4-7, 3.28) pitches in Houston to open a 10-game trip.

TRADING UP?:

Oakland got slugger Adam Dunn from the Chicago White Sox in a trade Sunday to help their slumping offense.

He can&#39;t arrive soon enough: The A&#39;s 29 straight innings without scoring a run was the third-longest streak in Oakland history. Oakland scored its first run since Thursday on Josh Reddick&#39;s RBI single off Mike Morin in the eighth.
