Mandatory Credit: Jim OLiga MX    Chivas Guadalajara vs Cruz Azul final score: On Sunday night, Chivas Guadalajara hosted Cruz Azul at Estadio Omnilife in the Week 7 finale of the Liga MX Apertura tournament.  It was a crucial game for both teams, who have had slow and disappointing starts to the tournament. Chivas entered the match sitting&nbsp;in the next-to-last spot in the Liga MX table tied with newcomers Leones Negros and ahead of only Monarcas Morelia. For Cruz Azul, the outlook is better as they sat&nbsp;in the No. 10 spot and could jump into playoff contention with a big win on the road. When the final whistle blew, Chivas and Cruz Azul were locked in a scoreless draw. The first half of the match was much of the same for Chivas. Guadalajara looked like the better team, but they were unable to score and we entered halftime with a scoreless draw. Chivas Guadalajara had nearly 60 percent of the possession and had held Cruz Azul to zero shots on goal, but they allowed them to remain right in the game thanks to their own offensive inefficiencies. In the second half, Chivas continued to control the pace, but they sputtered in the final third. Cruz Azul started to find quality chances of their own in the final minutes of the match, but Jose Rodriguez was keeping the clean sheet for Chivas. Unfortunately, he was getting no help and clumsy counter attacks from Guadalajara gave Chivas no chance to go ahead. Once again, a poor offensive effort left Chivas with zero goals in the scoreless draw. Be sure to stay tuned to FanSided.com throughout the 2014 Liga MX Apertura for the latest news and results.
