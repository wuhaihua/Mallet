                    Ryan Mallett has long been linked to the Texans, and it appears the Patriots backup quarterback&nbsp;is finally on his way to Houston.

New England traded Mallett to Houston, where former&nbsp;Pats offensive coordinator Bill O&#39;Brien is now head coach, on Sunday for a reported sixth-round draft pick, according to NFL.com. The Texans had to trade for Mallet rather than claiming the 6-6, 240-pound QB because the Cowboys wanted him too, according to the report.

It&#39;s not immediatly clear what kind of action Mallett will see with the Texans, who now have four quarterbacks on their depth chart. The 26-year-old is still a mystery in the NFL, having completed just one pass in three years of regular-season action behind Tom Brady.

Ryan Fitzpatrick is the current starter in Houston, with Case Keenum and rookie Tom Savage second and third string. Keenum is expected to be the odd man out.&nbsp;

The Patriots, meanwhile, are left with rookie Jimmy Garoppolo, who performed well enough throughout the preseason to allow Mallett&#39;s&nbsp;departure,&nbsp;as the lone backup in case something happens to Brady.&nbsp;
