                    Quietly over the Labor Day weekend, Nike announced it had exercised its option to match any offer a rival shoe company offered the Thunder&rsquo;s Kevin Durant. Durant signed the new deal, making it official Sunday night on Twitter,&nbsp;and it&nbsp;was confirmed Tuesday.

With all due respect to Oklahoma City, the 27th-largest U.S. city with a population just under 600,000, it&rsquo;s not a large market like Chicago, where Michael Jordan played for the Bulls.&nbsp;Durant is a pretty good basketball player, maybe even a great player, but he isn&rsquo;t a Jordan or a LeBron James and doesn&rsquo;t have James&rsquo; brand power.&nbsp;

So why then did Nike agree to pay Durant close to $350 million, after initially signing him to a seven-year, $60 million contract a year after he graduated high school?&nbsp;

The simplest explanation&nbsp;&mdash; the Nike brand. Though Durant still has two years and $41.2 million left on his contract with the Thunder, Nike realizes &nbsp;the options &mdash; and accompanying larger markets &mdash; Durant will have to sign elsewhere as a free agent. Nike&rsquo;s decision to offer hundreds of millions to Durant wasn&rsquo;t difficult.

&quot;For Nike, this was nothing to them,&quot; Omar Saad, senior managing director of ISI&#39;s luxury, apparel and footwear team, told ESPN. &quot;They could easily build Durant&#39;s business enough, assuming normal margins, where they could generate a cash flow of $60 million a year. And Nike is really good at monetizing its marketing assets, way better than anyone else.&quot;

However, Under Armour believed the time was right for the Baltimore-based apparel giant to jump into the basketball shoe business and offered Durant a contract. Second only to running in retails sales of shoes, basketball shoes generated $4.5 billion in retail sales in the United States last year. SportsOneSource, a market retail tracking firm, reported Durant&rsquo;s shoes accounted for $175 million in retail sales in 2013, so it was a no-brainer for Under Armour to get in the game.

According to HoopsHype.com, which breaks down the number of NBA players who endorse each shoe brand, reported that as of August 15, Nike led the way with 283 NBA players signed to their brand. The Jordan Brand, a Nike division, is third with 39 NBA, and Under Armour has just 13 NBA players wearing their shoes. If you added up all of Nike competitors, Nike really has no competition, as Nike owns more than 85 percent of the basketball shoe market.&nbsp;

Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank hoped if his company signed Durant they would be sending a message to the shoe industry that Under Armour was about to become a major player. Under Armour tried the same tactic with Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin and failed. It seems that all Under Armour has accomplished has been helping Durant and Griffin get bigger deals from Nike.&nbsp;
