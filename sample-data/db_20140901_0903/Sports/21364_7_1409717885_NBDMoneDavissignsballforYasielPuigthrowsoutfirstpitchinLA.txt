Davis, the Philadelphia Little Leaguer with the rocket arm, is a guest of the Dodgers at Chavez Ravine. She threw out the first pitch before Tuesday&#39;s game (she threw from in front of the mound,&nbsp;and, no, we don&#39;t have a radar gun reading).

It&#39;s just&nbsp;one more stop in&nbsp;an incredible &quot;How I Spent My Summer&quot; tour.&nbsp;A&nbsp;couple days ago, she&nbsp;visited&nbsp;with the WNBA&#39;s Lynx. Yeah, Davis&nbsp;is pretty good at basketball,&nbsp;too, it seems.
