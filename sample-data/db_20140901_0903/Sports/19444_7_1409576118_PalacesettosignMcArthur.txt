			Crystal Palace are set to sign James McArthur from Wigan Athletic for a club record fee of Â£7m.The midfielder arrived at Palace's training ground on deadline day to complete the formalities of his move - just days after a proposed transfer to Leicester fell through.Leicester agreed a fee for the Scot but later announced the signing of Argentine Esteban Cambiasso, prompting criticism from Wigan manager Uwe Rosler.McArthur and Leicester striker Chris Wood could yet end up as team-mates this season, with Palace also interested in the New Zealand international.If the McArthur deal goes through as expected, the 26-year-old will replace Dwight Gayle as Palace's most-expensive player.
