RG3 on fallout with Shanahan: 'it was just heartbreaking' RG3 on fallout with Shanahan: 'it was just heartbreaking' Sep 15, 2013; Green Bay, WI, USA; Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III (10) and head coach Mike Shanahan walk on the sidelines during the game against the Green Bay Packers in the third quarter at Lambeau Field. Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-USA TODAY SportsNFL    Robert Griffin III was a huge Mike Shanahan fan. It&rsquo;s just that Mike Shanahan wasn&rsquo;t a huge RG3 fan, or so RG3 believed. It was rough for the young quarterback, always thinking that his coach disliked him. And the fallout that ensued between the two was hard on RG3.  &ldquo;For me it was just heartbreaking,&rdquo;&nbsp;Griffin said, via Bleacher Report. &ldquo;You know with everything that happened&mdash;came into the league with&mdash;I was a huge Bronco fan, everybody knew that, and I had the coach of my dreams pick me in the draft.&rdquo; With that great high came an even greater low. &ldquo;I think if anyone had gone through that situation and not been hurt, then I don&rsquo;t know if they would be human,&rdquo; he says. And while it was a debacle, he doesn&rsquo;t need to digest it in its entirety. He needs to move on and focus on the 2014 season. &ldquo;&hellip; I don&rsquo;t need to try and understand what happened last year. I need to continue to grow as a football player, as a man, as a person for this team. That&rsquo;s been the goal this entire offseason. It&rsquo;s not to try and understand what happened last year. &ldquo;Yeah, I put last year into perspective and have used it as fuel to move me forward, but I don&rsquo;t need to try to understand why it happened because it&rsquo;s kind of like trying to understand why there are so many planets out there, or is anyone else out there, or how did God build the human body. How did all this stuff happen? It can drive you crazy.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;
