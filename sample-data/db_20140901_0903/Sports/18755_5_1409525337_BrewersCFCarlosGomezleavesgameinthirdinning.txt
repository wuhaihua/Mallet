Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY SportsMLB    Milwaukee Brewers center fielder Carlos Gomez has exited the game against the San Francisco Giants in the third inning due to a wrist injury. The severity of the injury is unknown at this time.  Gomez was replaced by Gerardo Parra, who was acquired by Brewers from the Arizona Diamondbacks at the trade deadline for Mitch Haniger and Anthony Banda. Parra has been used as a fourth outfielder and late game defensive replacement since his arrival in Milwaukee. He has appeared in 23 games, but has just 42 at bats. If Gomez is to miss time, Parra is a suitable replacement. He was hitting .259 with six home runs and five steals with the Diamondbacks. He has added a homer and two steals since joining the Brewers. Carlos Gomez opened the game with a bunt single in the first inning. He came around to score when Ryan Braun grounded into a double play. He had another at bat in the third inning, when he struck out swinging. It is unclear if that is when he hurt his wrist. Parra trotted out to center field in Gomez&rsquo;s stead when the bottom of the third began. The Milwaukee Brewers are still in a battle with the St. Louis Cardinals for first place in the National League Central. The Brewers lead the Cardinals by a game, with the Pittsburgh Pirates lurking at 2.5 games back. Gomez has been a big part of the resurgence of the Brewers this year, hitting .281 with 21 homers, 29 steals, and 65 RBI. If he does miss extended time, it will hamper the chances of the Brewers making the playoffs.
