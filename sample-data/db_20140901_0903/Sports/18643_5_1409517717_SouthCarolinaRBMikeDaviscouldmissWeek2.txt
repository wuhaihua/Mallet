Mandatory Credit: Rob Foldy-USA TODAY SportsNCAA Football    The South Carolina Gamecocks lost star running back Mike Davis during their season-opening loss against the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, after Davis aggravated a rib injury that had kept him out of action for a majority of the offseason.  Now, it would appear that Davis could miss the Gamecocks&rsquo; second game of the season against East Carolina. According to CBS Sports, South Carolina old ball coach Steve Spurrier says that Mike Davis is &ldquo;sort of doubtful&rdquo; for the Week 2 match up at Williams-Brice Stadium. We will have to see how Davis recovers leading up to the game against East Carolina before really learning whether or not he will be able to suit up for the game. Davis is one of the best running backs in the nation, so South Carolina will benefit by having a healthy Mike Davis on the field as soon as he is able to return. Until then, the offense will likely sputter.
