Marvel&rsquo;s Guardians of the Galaxy has risen above the rest this Labor Day weekend to take the top spot at the Box Office once again.  Guardians of the Galaxy added an additional $17.1 million to their already large Box Office take to bring their five-week domestic total to an estimated $275.4 million. The film has been performing just as well overseas as it has here in the States. When you add in the $273.1 million that Guardians has made overseas, the film&rsquo;s worldwide gross sits around $553.6 million. This has made Guardians of the Galaxy easily the biggest movie of the summer season. In second place once again this past weekend is the live-action reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Our favorite Heroes in a Half Shellbrought in an estimated $11.9 million, which brings the film&rsquo;s four-week domestic total to $162.6 million. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has also been performing well in the overseas markets. Our young heroes have brought in an estimated $112.1 million overseas, bringing the worldwide gross of the film to about $278.5 million. Also remaining in their same position> Debuting in the fourth position> Considering the very modest promotional push the film received from Universal, the low opening numbers don&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise. At this point, I wouldn&rsquo;t let that deter you from seeing the film. If all the trailers are to be believed, which we all know can be a slippery slope sometimes, it seems like a pretty decent and scary adventure. Sliding down one spot from last weekend is the cop comedy Let&rsquo;s Be Cops. The film, which stars New Girl stars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr, brought in an estimated $8.3 million over the Labor Day weekend, which brings the film&rsquo;s three-week domestic gross to about $57.4 million. It should also be mentioned that the film The November Man starring Pierce Brosnan entered the race this weekend. Unfortunately, it was unable to crack the top 5. This is a drop from Brosnan&rsquo;s last mainstream film The World&rsquo;s End alongside Simon Pegg and Nick Frost which earned an estimated $8.8 million on their opening weekend back in 2013. Next weekend is going to be a very light weekend at the Box Office, so don&rsquo;t expect any earth shaking changes next week. The only film moving into wide release next weekend is The Identical starring Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd. The weekend after this should show a little improvement as the family adventure Dolphin Tale 2 and the thriller No Good Deed enter the race. It may be a slow couple of weeks, but don&rsquo;t give up hope just yet. There are still plenty of amazing films heading your direction throughout the remainder of the year. So, hold on tight and get ready for a wild ride. Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at the Top 10 at the Box Office this weekend courtesy of Box Office Mojo.
