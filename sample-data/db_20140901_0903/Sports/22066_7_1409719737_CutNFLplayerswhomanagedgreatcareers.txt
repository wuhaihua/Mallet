                    Hundreds of NFL players at all stages of&nbsp;careers lost their jobs during&nbsp;Labor Day weekend (an unfortunate coincidence). It doesn&rsquo;t mean the end for all of them, though.

The unfortunate bunch, actually,&nbsp;can use the players on this list for inspiration. Some of the greatest players in pro football history, some Hall of Famers, were visited at least once by the dreaded Turk. Here are 10 of the best.

&nbsp;Back in 1955, he wasn&rsquo;t Johnny U &mdash;&nbsp;he was Johnny U-Don&rsquo;t-Have-A-Job.&nbsp;The Steelers cut Unitas&nbsp;at the end of his rookie training camp. He played semi-pro ball for a year, the Colts signed him a year later&nbsp;and then the legend began.

&nbsp;Being released by Buddy Ryan from the Eagles in 1990, three seasons into his career, was the defining moment of Carter&rsquo;s life, as it opened the door to&nbsp;addressing his drug and alcohol problems. Carter has repeatedly thanked Ryan&nbsp;since,&nbsp;including&nbsp;his Hall of Fame acceptance speech last year.

&nbsp;After going undrafted&nbsp;and before the shelf-stocking job and&nbsp;Arena football gig, Warner added to his narrative by being cut from&nbsp;the Packers in 1994 after training camp as a rookie.

&nbsp;He was hardly unappreciated coming out of college (he won the Heisman and was the No. 1 overall pick), but he had flopped in New England and San Francisco and was released by the 49ers in 1978. Two years later, he came off the Raiders bench to lead them to the first of his two Super Bowl wins.

&nbsp;The undrafted Welker made the 2004 Chargers&nbsp;regular-season roster&nbsp;but was cut after Week 1 to make room for another player. He went to Miami for the next three seasons, then was picked up as a free agent by New England. You know the rest.

&nbsp;He was undrafted out of college and was cut a total of four times in two seasons by two teams, the Steelers and Ravens, before finally sticking with Pittsburgh&nbsp;in 2004. Four years later, he was the NFL defensive player of the year&nbsp;and had the legendary 100-yard end-of-half pick-six in the Steelers&rsquo; Super Bowl win over the Cardinals.

&nbsp;He was passed over in the 1998 draft and&nbsp;signed by Baltimore, but Saturday never made it to training camp before being cut. He didn&rsquo;t get back onto an NFL roster until 1999&nbsp;when the Colts signed him.&nbsp;He snapped to Peyton Manning for the next 12 years.

&nbsp;A Division II star, he was signed by the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 1994. They cut him, and the Broncos picked him up and put him on the practice squad for a year. He made the roster the next season, won two Super Bowls with them&nbsp;and finished his 12-year career with 849 catches.

&nbsp;After sliding out of the 2009 draft, Foster was signed by the Texans. But they&nbsp;cut him at the end of the preseason, watched him pass through waivers and signed him to the practice squad. He was promoted to the roster in November, and the following season he broke out with an NFL-leading 1,616 yards.

&nbsp;Not only was Brown overlooked by both the NFL and AFL out of Grambling in the 1963 draft, the team that signed him, the Houston Oilers, cut him after his first training camp. He became a star in Denver after that,&nbsp;and the Broncos traded him to the Raiders in 1967.

Note: This list could double, at least, with the addition of players&nbsp;washed out of the NFL in the 1950s and 1960s and became legends in the AFL. At least two, George Blanda and Len Dawson, went to the Hall of Fame.
