			A review of the pick of Tuesday's action at Hamilton, where Baron Run enhanced his outstanding course record.Baron Run took his tally at Hamilton Park to four from seven visits when scrambling home in the Lanarkshiretrack's feature race on Tuesday.Ridden by Joey Haynes and trained by Karl Burke, he held off Layla's Hero by three quarters of a length in the £15,000 Betfair Scottish Sprint Series Final.Burke's daughter Kelly said: "Lucy, who looks after him, loves him to bits and he is down to go to the sales. We discussed the possibility that he could maybe stay if he won today so we'll need to see what dad says now!"Haynes added: "He obviously produces his best here and the ground was right for him too. I just let him roll on downthe hill and tried and keep a bit for the climb to the final furlong."Kieren Fallon, who is riding in Turkey at the weekend, struck on Legal Waves for Alan Swinbank in the Always Trying Open Maiden Stakes.The race was sponsored by Mark Johnston who generously donated a £50 cash prize to the grooms of each of the nine runners.Fallon said: "It's a lovely track to ride and it's always in good condition. I've always enjoyed coming here and the prize money isn't too bad either."
