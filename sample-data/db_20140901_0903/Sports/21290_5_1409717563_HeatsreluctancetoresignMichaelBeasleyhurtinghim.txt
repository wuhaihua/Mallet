Heat's reluctance to re-sign Michael Beasley hurting him? Heat's reluctance to re-sign Michael Beasley hurting him?

Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY SportsNBA    Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley had a solid season for the Heat last year. He was much efficient than&nbsp;earlier in his career but just couldn&rsquo;t find a defined role with the team, which kept him from making the impact he&rsquo;d have liked. However, because of his improved play he likely believed he&rsquo;d have plenty of suitors in free agency. Although Beasley has worked out for the Los Angeles Lakers, he hasn&rsquo;t received an offer.  Chuck Myron of Hoops Rumors believes the lack of interest in Beasley may be due to the Heat&rsquo;s reluctance to bring him back. Well, he certainly has the talent, and when he was on the floor for the Heat last season, he was productive. I think the issue is that teams are still reluctant to take a chance on a guy with his checkered past. He seemed to fit in quite well in Miami last season, but I wonder if the Heat&rsquo;s reluctance to re-sign him has sent ripple effects throughout the league. Beasley put up&nbsp;7.9 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in 55 games last season. He shot 49.9% from the floor, 38.9% from beyond the arc and 77.2% from the free throw line. Beasley&nbsp;has played for the Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns. The number two overall pick of the 2008 NBA Draft has averaged 13.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game while shooting 45.0% from the floor, 34.8% from three and 75.8% from the charity stripe in his six-year career career.
