Las Vegas vs. Seattle: How bad would our NHL expansion teams be? Las Vegas vs. Seattle: How bad would our NHL expansion teams be? 
           
                    Last week, Sean Gentille and I took the idea of a rumored NHL expansion a full step further, conducting a mock draft to initiate the Las Vegas Gambling References and Seattle Rain Drops into the NHL.

The exercise&nbsp;was fun and wound up serving as a useful cautionary tale for new teams, but ultimately it was just one big hypothetical. Sure, these teams look ghastly, but just how lousy would they actually be in real life?

At least it was, until Wyatt Ardnt took the liberty of inputting the two rosters we drafted into EA Sports&nbsp;NHL14&nbsp;video game, one middling depth player at a time. The results were comical, if not enlightening.&nbsp;A few housekeeping notes to tend to:

&mdash; Injuries were turned off&nbsp;because we didn&#39;t draft farm teams and, frankly,&nbsp;it would ruin the point of the experiment.&nbsp;

&mdash; Both sides were&nbsp;controlled by CPU, taking out any potential for human bias (though EA Sports&#39;&nbsp;continued disrespect of First Line Left Winger Patrick Maroon is a whole &#39;nother story!)

&mdash; As you may notice, there&#39;s no Arizona and there&#39;s no Florida in the simulation; that&#39;s because two teams needs to be replaced to make up for the two incoming squads, Panther/Coyotes fans can rest assured that this wasn&#39;t some sort of easy dig at their favorite teams (who just so happen to compete in&nbsp;non-traditional hockey markets).

&mdash; Seattle goes by the name &quot;Scorpions&quot; and Las Vegas by &quot;Mustangs&quot;. And here you were, thinking that our nicknames lacked creativity and pizzazz.

With that being said, here&#39;s how our babies wound up faring over the course of a full 82-game season:

Seattle&#39;s expansion season:



As could&#39;ve been anticipated, given that Shawn Horcoff was the only forward drafted by Seattle making over $2 million per season, they struggled mightily to score. It was so bleak, in fact, that not a single member of the team&nbsp;cracked 20 goals for the season.&nbsp;





Fortunately for Seattle, the investment in Thomas Greiss paid dividends, as he performed&nbsp;admirably in his first opportunity as a full-time starter in the league. It&#39;s envision to invision them having been equals of the Buffalo Sabres had their netminder not held the fort on many a night:



(Note: not shown is Greiss&#39; sparkling .921 save %)

Las Vegas&#39; Expansion Season:



Las Vegas was far more successful offensively than their expansion cohorts, as their attack was led by first overall pick Justin Abdelkader. In a shocking turn of events, Abdelkader not only doubled his best goal total, he also led the team with six&nbsp;game-winners. While GM&nbsp;Sean Gentille surely had his fair share of swings and misses the day of the draft, he unquestionably&nbsp;selected the face of the franchise (even though he had been critiqued for reaching at the time).







In a somewhat surprising turn of events, Las Vegas handed the reigns over to Viktor Fasth despite the fact that the guy he replaced had been drafted a full 22 spots before him. It&#39;s tough to fully attribute the lackluster play full on Fasth, however, considering the team&#39;s decision to make the likes of Ben Lovejoy and Dmitry Orlov the defensive backbone of their squad.

Here&#39;s how the two teams matched up statistically:

The most surprising outcome of&nbsp;the inaugural season may have Las Vegas&#39; relatively even home/road splits, proving counterintuitive to what most believed would be a sizeable advantage when teams came to town. Still, their advantage in the goal-scoring advantage was so significant that it still propelled them to a better record than Seattle. In reality, that&#39;s hardly a silver lining;&nbsp;both not only missed the playoffs by a lengthy margin, but weren&#39;t quite bad enough to pry Connor McDavid away from the Sabres&#39; open arms.

Instead of ending things there in a rather unsatisfying fashion, we went ahead and simulated a best-of-seven&nbsp;series between the teams for all of the marbles. Which team, city&nbsp;and general manager&nbsp;would get the final say if Seattle and Las Vegas went toe-to-toe?

Game 1:



After Shawn Matthias opened the scoring early&nbsp;in the second&nbsp;period for Seattle, it was all Las Vegas. It took them just a minute or so to tie the game, and despite having been a rock for them all season long, the softy Greiss relinquished to Mike Santorelli appears to have sunk the team. Wicked one-timers from Tuomo Ruutu and T.J. Galiardi gave Las Vegas a commanding 3-1 lead before Martin Havlat sealed the deal, giving his team a comfortable 4-1 win to open the series.


Game 2:



It&#39;s tough to say whether it was the demoralizing loss carrying over, or an unfortunately timed night out on the town, but Seattle was once again outclassed as Las Vegas scored three&nbsp;unanswered goals to take a commanding 3-0 lead. Whether you believe&nbsp;fights can swing&nbsp;momentum or not, it&#39;s worth noting that late in this one Abdeldaker made the grave mistake of challenging Eric Nystrom to a bout of fisticuffs. Nystrom handled him with ease and&nbsp;Seattle &mdash;&nbsp;likely influenced by score effects, as well &mdash;&nbsp;made a late push that ultimately fell short.&nbsp;


Game 3:



The stars of this game were the respective goaltenders, and it&#39;s hard to quibble with&nbsp;that. Especially Greiss, who after a tough few games to start the series made 36 of&nbsp;37 saves, maybe the most important of which was drawing a goaltender interference call against Ruutu, which wiped the potential go-ahead goal off of the board for Las Vegas. Seattle came right back down, and First Line Right Winger Ben Smith buried a rebound with the clock ticking down to get his team back in the series. After the game, Smith told reporters, &quot;There&#39;s no question that my in-game experience with the Chicago Blackhawks in such moments allowed me to thrive in this spot. It was a big two points for the boys, but we know we&#39;ve got to take this one game at a time. It shouldn&#39;t be a problem &mdash;&nbsp;we&#39;ve got a good group of guys in there.&quot;



Game 4:



Whoever said that a playoff series doesn&#39;t start until the home team loses must feel silly, because despite the fact that the home team has all four&nbsp;games following Seattle&#39;s 3-1 victory, this has been one heck of a back-and-forth. Though he was not recognized as the First Star, there&#39;s no denying that Conference III Favorite Gabriel Bourque swung this game for his team with a dominating pair of efforts in the second period. After that, it was all Greiss.



Game 5:



With their team up 2-0 and less than a minute left, the Las Vegas faithful&nbsp;tried to beat the rush to the blackjack tables. For those that decided to stay till the final buzzer &mdash;&nbsp;boy, did they get their money&#39;s worth.&nbsp;

After a Vern Fiddler tally gave Seattle some semblance of hope with 53 seconds left, madness ensued. Nystrom gained the offensive zone with a beautifully executed controlled entry immediately following the faceoff, before carving up the Las Vegas defense and burying a perfectly placed wrister past Lack to tie the game up. A few short moments later, Havlat replicated Nystrom&#39;s heroics with a great solo effort of his own, putting Las Vegas back up 3-2.

But with just 9.7 seconds left, it was Horcoff relentlessly jamming the puck away in the goal mouth before finally squeeking one past Lack to tie the game. For those scoring at home &mdash;&nbsp;that&#39;s four&nbsp;goals in the final 43 seconds of the game. If everyone is being clutch at the same time, then is anyone actually truly clutch? Makes you think.

For some utterly inexplicable reason, this instant classic was decided by a shootout, which Las Vegas wound up pulling out. A tough pill to swallow for Seattle following their resilient effort, and for the fans that attended the game but missed the madness of the closing seconds.

Game 6:



Speaking of inexplicable, Las Vegas&#39; decision to sit Lack after a strong showing in the series thus far in place of a cold Fasth was a head-scratching one to say the least. And unlike Louis Van Gaal&#39;s moves to bring keeper Tim Krul in for a decisive shootout in the World Cup quarterfinal, this swap most certainly didn&#39;t pay off for Las Vegas. Fasth was peppered to the tune of four&nbsp;unanswered goals, with a particular barrage in the middle frame, which sealed his team&#39;s fate. A dominant Game 6 showing in front of their fans sends this series back to Las Vegas, where the winner takes all.



Game 7:



With his team down 1-0 and being handily outplayed in the second period, Ruutu took matters into his own hands, roughing Blake Comeau up in a last-ditch attempt to spark his team. Following the bout, the commentator exclaimed, &quot;And Gary, if the home team can come back and win this hockey game remember this fight!&quot;

We&#39;ll definitely remember it, but moreso in a mocking manner because Matthias went right back down the ice and scored to double Seattle&#39;s lead. To make matters worse for both Las Vegas and the announcing team, Comeau scored a third goal shortly after having served his 5-minute fighting major to make it 3-0 Seattle. That would prove to be the final dagger, with Seattle becoming the first team to win a road game en route to claiming the Hypothetical Expansion Cup.

While all fans of the game enjoyed this series from afar, it&#39;s the diehards in the Pacific Northwest that cherish this victory the most. Particularly after one of their own was on the losing end of an eerily similar series not too long ago.
