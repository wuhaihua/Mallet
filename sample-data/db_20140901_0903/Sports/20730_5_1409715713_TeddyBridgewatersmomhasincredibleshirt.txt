That shirt shoots to the top of the list when it comes to Bridgewater paraphernalia. You can search far and wide, scouring the far corners of this great country of ours, and I dare say you will not find a finer piece of Bridgewater gear. I just hope the NFL doesn&rsquo;t catch wind of it because I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;ll make Teddy Bridgewater&rsquo;s mom surrender the shirt. I can&rsquo;t imagine that particular piece of apparel is officially licensed. You would think that a player&rsquo;s mom would have some kind of exemption from being pursued by NFL lawyers about unlicensed apparel, when said piece of unlicensed apparel features the child of the wearer in question, but this is the NFL we&rsquo;re talking about. Just let her slide on this one, NFL. That&rsquo;s her baby. We&rsquo;ve seen people emblazon pictures of their children and/or pets on their clothes before but this is taking it up a notch. Teddy Bridgewater&rsquo;s mom has mad That&rsquo;s-My-Baby game.
