U.S. Open 2014: Novak Djokovic through to quarterfinals U.S. Open 2014: Novak Djokovic through to quarterfinals 
           
                    NEW YORK &mdash; Playing mostly mistake-free tennis, top-seeded Novak Djokovic reached the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open for the eighth year in a row &mdash; and at a 22nd consecutive Grand Slam tournament overall.

Djokovic, the 2011 champion at Flushing Meadows, made only 19 unforced errors, saved both break points he faced, and breezed past 22nd-seeded Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 Monday.

The last time Djokovic was eliminated before the quarterfinals at a major was a third-round loss to Kohlschreiber at the 2009 French Open. But Djokovic has now won their four head-to-head matchups since then.

Employing his court-covering defensive style to perfection, Djokovic repeatedly forced Kohlschreiber to hit an extra shot, and the German wound up with nearly twice as many unforced errors, 36.

Still, Kohlschreiber &mdash; who eliminated the last American man in the field, 13th-seeded John Isner, in the third round at Flushing Meadows for the third straight year &mdash; had a chance to make Monday&#39;s match far more intriguing. Ahead 5-4 in the second set, with Djokovic serving, Kohlschreiber hit a forehand winner and then forced a rare backhand error at 30-all to earn a set point.

But Djokovic fended that off with what he later called a &quot;really good&quot; forehand passing shot winner to get to deuce, then held serve for 5-all and broke in the very next game to regain control.

&quot;Managed to win that set, which was crucial,&quot; Djokovic said.

Next up for the Serb, who reached the U.S. Open final each of the past four years, will be a match against 2012 U.S. Open champion Andy Murray or ninth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
