Injury updates: Doolittle feels good after throwing session Injury updates: Doolittle feels good after throwing session OAKLAND – Sean Doolittle threw a baseball Tuesday for the first time since landing on the disabled list with a strained muscle in his right side.
It was just a simple game of catch at 90 feet, but the A’s closer said his side didn’t bother him throwing and that he’s been recovering well. There’s no timetable yet for his next step – at least none that Doolittle or the team are discussing publicly – but manager Bob Melvin has talked optimistically about the lefty and how he’s felt in recent days.
Doolittle is eligible to be activated Monday, but for him to be a realistic option on that day, he’d have to be getting on the mound pretty quick. Regardless, his recovery seems to be a positive development for the A’s at this point.
Catcher John Jaso was scheduled to take full batting practice Tuesday for the first time since joining the D.L. because of a concussion. He ran sprints on the field and shagged flies Monday.
“Yesterday I was getting a little foggy after the sprints and the prolonged exposure out there,” Jaso said. “I came in (the clubhouse) and things settle down.”
It stands to reason he’ll have to be rid of those symptoms before he’s cleared by the medical staff to return.
“I think ‘soon’ would be all I could say” as far as a timetable, Jaso said.
