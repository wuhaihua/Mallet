Patriots claim undrafted rookie DT Quarles off waivers Patriots claim undrafted rookie DT Quarles off waivers August 31, 2014, 2:45 pm The Patriots added some depth to their defensive line on Sunday, claiming undrafted rookie defensive tackle Kelcy Quarles off waivers.
Quarles was cut on Saturday by the New York Giants but did reportedly impress many in Giants camp. Quarles was crunched out of the roster due to a number of veterans on the line. An ankle injury suffered in camp also put him a bit behind the rest of the pack.
A product of the South Carolina Gamecocks, Quarles had 9.5 sacks in his junior season.
