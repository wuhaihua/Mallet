                    Normally, a pitcher has to work to control his nerves through the final few outs of a potential no-hitter. Phillies ace Cole Hamels had no such issues on Monday afternoon at Turner Field in Atlanta.&nbsp;

See, his work on the mound&nbsp;was done. Hamels was what you&#39;d call effectively wild against the Braves. In six innings, he walked five Atlanta hitters and struck out seven, while holding the Braves without a hit. Because his pitch count was already at 108 after the sixth inning and he had zero chance of completing the no-no himself, manager Ryne Sandberg took him out.&nbsp;

That meant Hamels could only sit and watch the Philly bullpen try and complete the job. Lefty Jake Diekman got the call in the seventh inning, and he retired his three Atlanta batters on 15 pitches, the same number Ken Giles needed to set the Braves down in order in the eighth. Diekman and Giles struck out five of the six hitters they faced.&nbsp;

And that meant the ninth belonged to Jonathan Papelbon, despite the fact that he doesn&#39;t typically work when the Phillies have a 7-0 lead. But this was different, obviously.&nbsp;

The Braves didn&#39;t offer up much resistance. Papelbon retired all three hitters he faced to close out one of the rare highlights for what&#39;s been another frustrating season in Philadelphia.&nbsp;
