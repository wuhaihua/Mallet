The         Houston Texans have acquired quarterback         Ryan Mallett from the         New England Patriots for a conditional draft pick, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The Patriots received a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2016, according to a source.

     

Mallett, 26, could have a bright future with the rebuilding Texans, who will enter this season with veteran journeyman         Ryan Fitzpatrick as their starting quarterback.

To make room for Mallett on their roster, the Texans will waive quarterback         Case Keenum, a source told ESPN. Keenum started eight games last season and had been battling rookie         Tom Savage for a backup role behind Fitzpatrick.

The 6-foot-6 Mallett was drafted by New England in the third round in 2011 and had served as         Tom Brady's primary backup in each of the last two seasons.

But Mallett was passed on the Patriots' depth chart this summer by rookie         Jimmy Garoppolo, a second-round pick who impressed throughout training camp and the preseason.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick would not comment on the team's depth chart at quarterback following last Thursday's preseason finale against the         New York Giants.

But Garoppolo played the entire game against New York, punctuating a stellar preseason during which he completed 46 of 79 passes for 618 yards, five touchdowns and one interception.

Mallett appeared in three games this preseason, completing 14 of 26 attempts for 161 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.
