Nemanja Vidic sent off in competitive debut for Inter Milan Nemanja Vidic sent off in competitive debut for Inter Milan Aug 2, 2014; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Inter Milan defender Nemanja Vidic (15) dribbles the ball during the first half of the match against Roma at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: John Geliebter-USA TODAY SportsSerie A    Manchester United legend Nemanja Vidic made his Inter Milan debut against Torino, but was left red faced after a 92nd minute dismissal. The debut was one to forget for the former United captain, who also conceded a penalty for his side. Luckily, Torino were unable to convert in a game that finished 0-0, a lacklustre start for Walter Mazzarri&rsquo;s side after finishing 5th in the last campaign. Vidic conceded the penalty in the first half, though goalkeeper Samir Handanovic came to his rescue after saving&nbsp;Marcelo Larrondo&rsquo;s weak&nbsp;effort. Torino had the better of the action, though missed a number of clear-cut chances, including a glaring miss from new signing Fabio Quagliarella. While Inter dominated 61% of the possession, it was Torino who perhaps should have gone away with more than just a point. Both sides hit the target on two occasions in a lacklustre draw in their opening Serie A fixture. After giving away a foul in the late minutes, the former United defender Vidic was spotted sarcastically clapping and putting his thumbs up to the referee &mdash; an act that is usually punished harshly. The referee responded by brandishing the red card, to mark a instantly forgettable debut for Inter&rsquo;s summer signing. Check out the Vine below.
