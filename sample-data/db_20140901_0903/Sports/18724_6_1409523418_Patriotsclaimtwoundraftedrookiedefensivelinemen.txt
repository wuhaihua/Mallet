Patriots claim two undrafted rookie defensive linemen Patriots claim two undrafted rookie defensive linemen August 31, 2014, 2:45 pm The Patriots added some depth to their defensive line on Sunday, claiming rookie DL Kelcy Quarles off waivers from the New York Giants and rookie DL Bruce Gaston off waivers from Arizona.
Quarles was cut on Saturday by the New York Giants but did reportedly impress many in Giants camp. Quarles was crunched out of the roster due to a number of veterans on the line. An ankle injury suffered in camp also put him a bit behind the rest of the pack.
A product of the South Carolina Gamecocks, Quarles had 9.5 sacks in his junior season.
Gaston played in 50 consecutive games over four seasons at Purdue with 44 starts and finished with 131 total tackles, seven sacks, four fumble recoveries and two forced fumbles.
The team also announced that it has released linebacker Chris White. White was originally claimed off waivers and awarded to the Patriots from Detroit on Sept. 1, 2013  The Patriots added some depth to their defensive line on Sunday, claiming rookie DL Kelcy Quarles off waivers from the New York Giants and rookie DL Bruce Gaston off waivers from Arizona.
