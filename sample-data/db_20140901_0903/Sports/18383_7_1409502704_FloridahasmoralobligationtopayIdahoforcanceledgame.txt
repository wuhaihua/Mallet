                    Florida&#39;s legendary football stadium, &quot;The Swamp,&quot; lived up to its nickname Saturday night.

The Gators&#39;&nbsp;home opener against Idaho at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium was canceled following&nbsp;a near three-hour storm&nbsp;delay, followed by 10&nbsp;seconds of actual football, followed by another delay, this time 40 minutes, before cancelation.



So what now? Both schools happen to be&nbsp;off&nbsp;Saturday, Oct. 25, and the game can be re-scheduled. But will it?&nbsp;There is a matter of the $975,000 guarantee Florida&rsquo;s athletic department paid Idaho to travel to&nbsp;Gainesville&nbsp;for a game&nbsp;called off by an &quot;act of God.&quot;

Most guaranteed athletic events include a generic clause that deals with what took place Saturday,&nbsp;according to ESPN&#39;s Darren Rovell. &quot;Neither party shall be considered in default of this agreement for failure of its football team to appear and participate in the above games for reasons due to acts to Gods, national disaster, national emergency, labor disputes, or orders of a state or federal court or authority or prohibitory or injunctive orders of any competent judicial authority, government, governing association of which both parties are members, or other similar events beyond control of any party.&quot;

Florida SID Steve McClain&nbsp;told ESPN,&nbsp;&quot;We are working through the scenarios regarding the finances of the game.&quot;

Legally, it appears Florida can walk away from the agreement&nbsp;and&nbsp;not pay Idaho&nbsp;the $975,000.&nbsp;Idaho could be forced to pay all of its expenses for the weather-terminated game.

The Vandals were&nbsp;nothing more than scheduled cannon fodder for the Gators. But keep in mind&nbsp;last year Florida paid $550,000 for FCS Georgia Southern to travel to Gainesville, only to lose&nbsp;to the Eagles.

The NCAA recently projected that&nbsp;20 of&nbsp;125 FBS schools will generate revenues from&nbsp;football programs in 2014. A&nbsp;staggering 86 percent will lose money playing football this year, but Florida won&#39;t be one of them.&nbsp;According to a Department of Education report, Florida&rsquo;s football program generated&nbsp;a profit of $51,071,589 last season;&nbsp;a bad season.

Florida can force Idaho to pay all associated traveling expenses, but Idaho&#39;s rationale for agreeing to the game didn&#39;t include&nbsp;costing the athletic department money; a money-losing football program being forced to suffer even more.

The Gators, who play in the economic engine that is the SEC, do not lose money. More than 40,000&nbsp;fans were at the stadium&nbsp;when the game was finally canceled. They, and the rest&nbsp;who bought tickets,&nbsp;will be offered refunds.

So what is the perception of a football program that makes&nbsp;over&nbsp;$50 million not at the very least offering to cover&nbsp;the expenses Idaho budgeted for Saturday&rsquo;s&nbsp;game?

While it may not be legally bound to pay Idaho, there&#39;s a moral obligation for Florida to pay the Vandals the full guarantee&nbsp;and agree to cover all&nbsp;costs if the game is rescheduled for&nbsp;October.&nbsp;

There&#39;s danger in Florida setting&nbsp;precedent for paying Idaho when the game was canceled by an &quot;act of God.&quot; But keeping the Lord&rsquo;s name out of their decision, the Gators&nbsp;should do what&rsquo;s right and pay the Vandals.
