			Laura Trott will leave Wiggle Honda and join fellow British team Matrix Fitness – Vulpine at the end of the season.Trott was one of the founding members of the Bradley Wiggins Foundation-backed Wiggle Honda squad when it was launched in 2013.The 22-year-old went on to win the 2013 Women’s Grand Prix in London and then the 2014 British national road race title in Wales in the team’s colours.However, she has now signed a one-year deal with Matrix Fitness – Vulpine and cited the team’s commitment to developing women’s cycling in Britain as a key factor behind the move.“I have had an amazing two years with Wiggle Honda,” Trott told Sky Sports News HQ. “They have done all they can with me and really supported me as a track rider, but I have decided to move away from Wiggle and join the Matrix Vulpine team.“The way they have gone about developing the sport – and not just their team, but British cycling as a whole – is fantastic. I want to be a part of that.”Wiggle Honda compete in the top tier of women’s cycling and are present at races throughout the world, whereas Matrix Fitness – Vulpine are currently a domestic team, albeit with ambitions to move up to the elite level.Despite taking a step down and leaving behind fellow Britons Joanna Rowsell, Dani King and Elinor Barker at Wiggle Honda, Trott hopes the move will help with her preparations for track events at the 2016 Olympics Games in Rio.“It will be really hard to leave [Wiggle Honda]," Trott added. "It’s been amazing to ride with the track girls, but it’s time for me to move on."With it being two years away from Rio, I want to knuckle down and cut out as much travelling as I can and I feel Matrix is the way to do that.”
