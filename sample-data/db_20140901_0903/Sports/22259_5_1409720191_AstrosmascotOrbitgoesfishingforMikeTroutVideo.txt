If that is the case, we are all in for a lot of references to fish.  There will be jokes about fish, puns about fish, fan-made signs about fish, and perhaps even some more shoes designed like fish. On this front, it appears that Trout intends to be a good sport and perhaps even partake in all of the fishiness. On Tuesday night, Houston Astros&rsquo; mascot Orbit took a fishing pole to the field during warm-ups&nbsp;because&nbsp;he was fishing for Mike Trout. Get it? It was actually a funny visual, thanks in large part to the fact that Trout was willing to play along. Trout even turned the tables on Orbit, stealing the fishing pole and then going to fish for him. When you think of fishing, you might think of relaxation. Then again, you might also think of ridiculously early mornings, darkness, boredom, and the unpleasant sensation of touching slimy things. Whatever your take on actual fishing, this version of the recreation involved a grown man (or woman) in an alien costume and the best baseball player on the planet.
