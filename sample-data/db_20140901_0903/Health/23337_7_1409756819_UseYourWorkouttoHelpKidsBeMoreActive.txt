        We all are aware of the childhood obesity crisis in our nation—and now there’s a new and easy way you can help!Through September 15, Jamba Juice will donate $1 to DonorsChoose to provide athletic equipment for schools in need when you pledge to do something healthy for the day or week. As part of their Team Up for a Healthy America program, all you have to do is post your personal pledge—whether that’s going for a run in the park, hitting spin class three times this week, or bringing a healthy lunch to work—on your Twitter or Instagram, and hashtag #TeamUp and #JambaJuice.By joining the initiative, you not only have accountability in your journey to a healthier self, you will also be improving the nutrition and fitness of kids. Everyone wins! While you’re at it, why not teach your niece some yoga or take the neighbors’ kids on a bike ride?For more information, click here.
