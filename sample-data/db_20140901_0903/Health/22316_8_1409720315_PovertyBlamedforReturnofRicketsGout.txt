Recent poverty in Britain has seen the return of diseases like rickets and gout that were prevalent in the Victorian era.

(Doctors) are reporting rickets anecdotally in Manchester, the East End of London, Birmingham and the West Midlands. It is a condition we believed should have died out.&quot; Poverty in Britain has become a hot political topic since the global financial crisis. Wages have been consistently below the rate of inflation since 2008 there has been a rise in food banks. Rickets is caused by lack of vitamin D and calcium and affects bone development in children. Gout, a type of arthritis, can be caused by obesity and a diet rich in chemical compounds called purines found in foods like sardines and liver.
