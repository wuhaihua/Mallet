Fittr Helps You Get In Shape With Varied, Voice-Guided Workouts Fittr Helps You Get In Shape With Varied, Voice-Guided Workouts iOS (Android coming soon): Fittr is a mobile app that helps you get and stay motivated to get in shape and find workouts that you can do safely. Those workouts adapt to you over time, getting more challenging as you progress, and backing off if you have trouble.

Fittr isn&#8217;t alone in this space. Previously mentionedBodBot and Fitness Buddy, another app we love, both offer varied and personalised workouts with detailed instruction on how to do the exercises.
Fittr wants to take things up a notch by also allowing you to track your measurements, giving you the flexibility to swap exercises in your workout for other exercises that still fit the theme, and keep your friends up to speed on your progress. The exercises are paired with video and voice guidance to make sure you do them correctly and keep the momentum up.
Unlike a lot of the apps we&#8217;ve highlighted, Fittr is a subscription app. Measurement tracking is free, and you can use the app to keep an eye on your reps, weight, and progress. The workouts however cost money, and to access all of them beyond the basic set available to everyone you&#8217;ll need to spend $US8/month, or sign up for 6 month blocks ($US36) or 12 month blocks ($US48). 
Fittr brings a lot of features we&#8217;ve seen in a number of free apps together. We&#8217;ve checked out lots of apps that offer free workouts and video guidance, and other free apps that let you track your progress and measurements, but Fittr combines both into a single fitness hub. You can get a free five day trial when you download the app so you can see if the convenience and workouts are worth the subscription price for you. Hit the link below to get started.
