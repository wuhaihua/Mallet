Paramedic delivers his own baby on side of road Paramedic delivers his own baby on side of road Dan Lynch is a paramedic who had been through the births of his four kids, so when wife Elizabeth woke up early Friday with serious contractions &quot;skeptical&quot; that Baby No. 5 would hold out for the ride to the hospital, &quot;we gave it a shot&quot; anyway, says Dan. &quot;And obviously we didn&rsquo;t make it.&quot; Instead, the couple from Evanston, Ill., ended up pulled over on the shoulder of the road as Mary Margaret Lynch put in a rapid appearance with dad giving an assist. &quot;The baby&#39;s head was already halfway out,&quot; he tells People. &quot;I said, &#39;Push.&#39;&quot; He&#39;d had some training on delivering babies, but it was the first time he&#39;d ever assisted with a birth, and though he admits it wasn&#39;t &quot;the most ideal circumstances,&quot; he&#39;s thankful that everyone is healthy. &quot;I opened the door for some light because it was pretty dark out,&quot; he tells the Chicago Tribune. &quot;It was a good catch.&quot; The Lynches say their family is now complete, and as dad says, &quot;it was save the best story for last.&quot; (Earlier this year, an 8-year-old girl helped deliver her baby brother.)More From NewserMarines Helicopter Crashes With 25 on BoardTV Host&#39;s Killer Was His Son-in- Law, Lover: CopsBanned by Russia Sanctions, AK-47s Flying Off Shelves
