The Combo Lift That Builds Strength and Sheds Fat The Combo Lift That Builds Strength and Sheds Fat        The squat and the overhead press are two power-house moves that hit big fat-torching muscles like your glutes, quads, and shoulders. When merged together, you can work a ton of muscles at once and save time. But if you want to take the move one step further, add a rotation between the exercises to hit your core.&nbsp;
"The rotation may start with a pivot at your feet, but your obliques must carry out the rest of the motion," says BJ Gaddour, C.S.C.S., CEO of Men's Health StreamFIT. In fact, your entire midsection must kick into gear to keep you steady when your upper chest, traps, upper back, and triceps press the weight overhead as you turn.
Watch the video above to learn how to perform the dumbbell squat to rotational press with perfect form. You can do the move slowly to build more total-body strength, or pick up the pace to skyrocket your heart rate and fat loss.
