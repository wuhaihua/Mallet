How Effective Is PicoSure Tattoo Removal? [Video] How Effective Is PicoSure Tattoo Removal? [Video] 
CynoSure is a new tattoo-removal company that recently set up shop in Australia. It uses a picosecond aesthetic laser dubbed PicoSure to shatter ink into tiny particles without leaving scarring or burns. Last week, we accompanied a Lifehacker reader during her first PicoSure treatment. Check out the video to see the results unfold firsthand.    
Like many young, carefree Aussies of the 1990s, Kelly Starr decided to get inked on her 19th birthday. Unlike most Aussies, she plumped for a blurry blue dragon called Spyro. Needless to say, it was a rite of passage that she eventually came to regret. Below you&#8217;ll find the full sorry saga of Spyro the sort-of dragon and its eventual slaying under Picosure&#8217;s precise laser technology. 
Crazed And Confused
&#8220;I was pretty excited to get a tattoo once I turned 18, and gave a lot of thought into what I wanted to have,&#8221; Kelly explained to Lifehacker just before her treatment. &#8220;It seemed to me that a dragon was pretty much the epitome of cool tattoo wise &#8212; no girly butterflies or dolphins here! 
&#8220;So I spent a lot of time looking at dragon tattoo pics and visualising where I wanted it. After giving a lot of consideration to the shoulder blade area I decided that yes, the upper back was the perfect spot for my dragon. I thought that said dragon would look pretty sporting on a sword, and so the ‘dragon on a sword’ masterpiece was drawn, then inked onto my back in 1999 when I had just turned 19.&#8221;
Kelly dubbed her permanent pal &#8220;Spyro&#8221; after the titular video game dragon on the PlayStation One. To most observers, the tattoo looked more like a worm than a wyvern, but this did not deter Kelly in the slightest (at least, not at first.)   
&#8216;Pssst &#8212; It&#8217;s a dragon!&#8217;
&#8220;Spyro and I were pretty damn cool together; him poking out the top of my wife-beater at punk shows, ruining my formal look at cousin&#8217;s weddings, getting me kicked out of hotel pools in Tokyo; you name it. But Spyro has not aged well. The tattoo was always quite light, and over the years time and sun exposure have taken their toll and blurring lines and fading have caused him to decline into a dragon shaped blur.  
&#8220;Plus the initial positioning of the tattoo was never quite right. Because the dragon is face down on the sword, it’s pretty hard to people to work out what it even is; especially when the bottom is covered by clothing. I’m pretty sure most of my friends have no idea what it actually is and are just too polite to ask.
&#8220;I eventually talked to a few tattoo artists about possibly working around it, but none were interested due to it’s poor condition.  They all advised me that removal was the way to go. Spyro and I have had a good run over the last 15 years, but it’s time to say goodbye!&#8221;
Picosure To The Rescue?
Until very recently, tattoo removal was a painful and time-consuming process that often produced mixed results &#8212; especially when green and blue inks were involved. Global company CynoSure is looking to change all that with its arsenal of photomechanical lasers.

Unlike traditional laser treatments, Picosure uses patented &#8220;PressureWave&#8221; technology to deliver ultra-short pulses of energy into the patient&#8217;s skin in trillionths of a second. It targets ink while avoiding unmarked tissue, resulting in less damage to the surrounding skin. Over a series of treatments, the ink is converted into dust-like particles that are small enough to be eliminated by the human body.  
If CynoSure is to be believed, its lasers create clearer results in fewer treatments. It&#8217;s not cheap though: a single session will set you back up to $5000 per session, with most tattoos requiring three separate sessions. Traditional tattoo removal is a lot more affordable on a per-session basis, but the total number of appointments is much higher &#8212; you can expect to endure up to 12 sessions for a single tattoo and the procedure is considered more painful. 

When CynoSure offered a free PicoSure trial to a Lifehacker reader, Kelly leaps at the chance, despite some initial reservations:
&#8220;When I heard about the offer, I watched some YouTube videos of tattoo removal and some people were crying and screaming, which was a little freaky. I&#8217;m going to try my hardest to be a little more dignified!&#8221; 
After a brief consultation process, Kelly found herself in the PicoSure chair. There was no turning back now &#8212; in a few minutes, Spyro would be toast. Check out the video to see how she fared:


                
            
As you can see from the above video, the Picosure laser really does seem to work. While filming, I was impressed by how quickly the inks transformed into frost-like flesh; almost as if an eraser was being applied to a picture. The entire session took less then ten minutes, including the frequent ice pack breaks.
Here&#8217;s a side-by-side comparison of the tattoo after one treatment:

The tattoo is already pretty faded, particularly in the green areas. Patients are required to wait six weeks in-between sessions. We&#8217;ll be catching up with Kelly during her final treatment, so keep your eyes peeled for the final result.
Early Verdict
If you have tattoo regrets of your own, you&#8217;re doubtlessly wondering how painful the procedure and immediate aftermath is. Here&#8217;s what Kelly had to say two days after her first treatment:  
&#8220;I was worried that it would start to ache, or burn, or that it would get hard to move my arms, but nothing changed, it feels the same now as it did when I walked out of there. I had no trouble driving, or sleeping with it. I’m moving a bit stiffly, but I think it’s more paranoia than I can’t move without it hurting. 
&#8220;Thoughts so far: the procedure was faster than I thought it might be, and Dr Keith and the rest of the team were super reassuring. I drove home feeling like all would be okay. I’m feeling pretty confident the result will be good. If there is the possibility of it being gone completely, then it might be easier to shop for clothes to wear to work.  We will have to wait and see though.&#8221;
We&#8217;ll be back with our final verdict in the months to come.
