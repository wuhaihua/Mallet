Woman's buttocks impaled in texting-while-driving crash Woman's buttocks impaled in texting-while-driving crash Ouch, and double ouch: A woman says she was texting while driving when she struck a pole that pierced her truck and ran through her buttocks and thigh, USA Today reports. Christina Jahnz says she had just dropped off her daughter&#39;s saxophone at a middle school in Elizabeth, Colo., when she voice-texted and looked down to double-check it. That&#39;s when she hit the guard rail at 20mph. &quot;The next thing I knew, I was looking up, there was white powder from the air bags deployed,&quot; Jahnz says. As for the pole, an estimated 4 inches in diameter, &quot;I could feel it in there,&quot; she says, according to ABC 10. Firefighters had to saw off both ends of the pole to get her out of the truck. Rushed to Parker Adventist Hospital, Jahnz &quot;lost count of the stitches after 40,&quot; she says. &quot;They stitched me up inside too. I&#39;m truly a miracle. They said if it gone just a little bit the other way I would have bled out.&quot; Released Sunday after a four-day stay, she&#39;s getting around with a walker and is expected to recover. &quot;I just hope my story helps to save the lives of others,&quot; says Jahnz. &quot;Don&#39;t text and drive.&quot; (Looks like the first text to 911 came from ... a driver.)More From NewserMarines Helicopter Crashes With 25 on BoardBanned by Russia Sanctions, AK-47s Flying Off ShelvesTV Host&#39;s Killer Was His Son-in- Law, Lover: Cops
