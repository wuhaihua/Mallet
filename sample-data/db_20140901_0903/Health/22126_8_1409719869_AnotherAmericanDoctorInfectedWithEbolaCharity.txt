An American doctor suffering from Ebola was improving at an Atlanta hospital, officials said, as reports emerged 04 August that he had received an experimental serum while still in Africa and near death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with the US State Department, the US National Institute of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated the delivery of the serum that Brantly and Writebol received, Samaritan's Purse said.

The charity said it was not yet known how the doctor was infected, but he immediately isolated himself when he showed symptoms.The new case comes two weeks after Dr. Kent Brantly and his colleague Nancy Writebol, who worked for SIM, walked out of an Atlanta hospital virus-free after being infected and evacuated from Liberia.The doctor was transferred to the Ebola isolation unit and is doing well and in good spirits, SIM said in a statement. The group planned a briefing later Tuesday.“My heart was deeply saddened, but my faith was not shaken, when I learned another of our missionary doctors contracted Ebola,” said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. “As a global mission, we are surrounding our missionary with prayer, as well as our Liberian SIM/ELWA colleagues, who continue fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia.”
