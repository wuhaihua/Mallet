He was pursued though a market and into the street by an increasingly angry and agitated crowd. It was not known if the man had Ebola or was simply being held in protective quarantine without symptoms.Eventually a medical team, wearing protective clothing, caught up with him and tried to persuade the man to return before bundling him into the back of a pick-up.Ebola patients previously fled a quarantine center in Monrovia during a looting incident, and residents said patients had not been given sufficient food and water.IN-DEPTHContinuing Coverage of the Ebola Outbreak in West AfricaSlum Residents Loot Ebola Clinic in LiberiaLiberia Gives Three Doctors Experimental ZMapp treatment-Peter Jeary with Reuters
