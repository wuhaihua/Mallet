Why you feel awesome running that 10K one day and horrible the next has to do with what you eat, drink and what you think about. If you&#8217;re looking for a bit more consistency in your exercise, here are the six factors The Wall Street Journal suggests you keep an eye on:


    Sleep: A bad night of sleep can affect workouts for up to 48 hours. If you&#8217;re struggling with sleep, The Wall Street Journal suggests you try to maintain your workout schedule as best as possible.
  

    Water: If you don&#8217;t get enough water before or after a workout, it can lead to inconsistency.
  

    Drinking alcohol: If you&#8217;ve ever tried to exercise after a night of beers, this is pretty obvious. Drink lots of water and you&#8217;ll be back on track.
  

    Boredom: If you&#8217;re doing the same routine over and over, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll feel sluggish out of pure boredom. Mix it up and try new exercises.
  

    Eating: Exercising demands a lot of energy, so if you&#8217;re not eating the right foods, you might feel sluggish because you simply don&#8217;t have the energy to really work out.
  

    Recharge time: Sometimes, you feel like junk during a workout because you worked out too hard the last time you exercised. The Wall Street Journal suggests rating your energy level each day on a scale of 1 to 10, if you never reach 8 or 9, you&#8217;re probably working out too often.
  

There are other possibilities for a sluggish workout too, like stress or anxiety, but the above should help explain why you feel amazing one day and slow as a snail the next.
