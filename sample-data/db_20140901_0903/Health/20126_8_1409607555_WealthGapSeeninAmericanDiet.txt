Yet even among wealthier adults, food choices remain far from ideal, a 12-year study found. On an index of healthy eating where a perfect score is 110, U.S. adults averaged just 40 points in 1999-2000, climbing steadily to 47 points in 2009-10, the study found. Scores for low-income adults averaged almost four points lower than those for high-income adults at the beginning; the difference increased to more than six points in 2009-10. The results are published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.Higher scores mean greater intake of heart-healthy foods including vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats, and a high score means a low risk of obesity and chronic illnesses including heart disease, strokes and diabetes. Low scores mean people face greater chances for developing those ailments. The widening rich-poor diet gap is disconcerting and &quot;will have important public health implications,&quot; said study co-author Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health. Diet-linked chronic diseases such as diabetes have become more common in Americans in general, and especially in the poor, he noted. &quot;Declining diet quality over time may actually widen the gap between the poor and the rich,&quot; Hu said.IN-DEPTHWeight-Loss Program May Rewire Brain to Crave Healthy FoodYou're Eating More Trans-Fat Than You Think You AreSOCIAL— The Associated Press
