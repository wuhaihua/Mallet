        Pair this mix with our Dance Your Way to Abs Workout for a fun and effective routine that proves planks and crunches arenâ€™t the only way to flatten your muffin top and strengthen your core. The songs were selected by Jennifer Galardi, star of the Dance Off the Inches: Hip Hop Jam DVD, to match perfectly with her exercises. Get the workout, then add these upbeat songs to your music player to start busting moves at the gym, in your living room, or wherever the beat takes you!RELATED: 15-Minute Belly-Fat-Blaster WorkoutLatch - Disclosure and Sam SmithWhen Love Takes Over (Laidback Luke Remix) - David Guetta feat.
