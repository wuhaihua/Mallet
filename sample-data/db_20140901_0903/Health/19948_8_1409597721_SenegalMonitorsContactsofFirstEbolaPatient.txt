An Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed more than 1,500 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The university student is Senegal's first case of the dreaded disease.The 21-year-old left Guinea on Aug. 15, just days after his brother died of the disease, according to Guinea's Health Ministry. The student traveled by road, crossing into Senegal despite a border closure. Senegal's Health Ministry said Sunday that it has since traced everyone the student came into contact with, and they are being examined twice a day. Since the young man left home, his mother and a sister have died of the disease, and two other brothers are being treated for it. President Macky Sall said Monday that everything is being done to prevent any further cases of the disease in Senegal, including public awareness campaigns and television programs aimed at encouraging good hygiene practices, like regular hand-washing.
