          Planks and crunches are great, but if you love really rocking out to your gym playlist, being stuck on the floor can get a bit boring. We asked dance instructor Jennifer Galardi, star of the Dance Off the Inches: Hip Hop Jam DVD, to pair her favorite abs-toning dance moves with some awesome tunes (find her playlist here) so you can get an incredible core workout, without ever having to hit the floor. RELATED: The Cover Model Abs Workout
