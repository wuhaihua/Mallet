Box Office: 'Ghostbusters' Fails To Top 'Guardians' On Labor Day Weekend Box Office: 'Ghostbusters' Fails To Top 'Guardians' On Labor Day Weekend Yes, that headline is a little tongue-in-cheek, which I feel the need to point out as someone was allegedly passing around my deadpan reference to Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&nbsp;as a “faith-based romantic drama” from last weekend’s report as an example of shameful typos at Forbes. I make my share of typos, but that wasn’t one of them. 
Anyway, as a rule of thumb, Labor Day weekend is a rather dull weekend at the box office. Even though it is a holiday, it marks the unofficial end of the summer season, as kids return to school and the studios prepare for the fall. For the sake of something interesting to write about, I was hoping &nbsp;Sony's&nbsp;Ghostbusters&nbsp;would top the box office in its 1,573rd weekend of release*. The 1984 sci-fi comedy smash was of course reissued this weekend on 784 screens. It earned $1.65m for the Fri-Sun frame and $2 million for the long holiday weekend. The good news, to the extent that a “for the fans” theatrical reissue of a 30-year old movie means much, is that it was in line with the $1.6m IMAX reissue of&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark&nbsp;back in 2012 and the 2013 3D-reissue of&nbsp;Top Gun&nbsp;in 2013 (on about 300 screens apiece). It also crossed the $240m domestic mark, becoming the slowest movie in history to do so.
	
								 
 
The “top” new wide release was the Universal (Comcast Corp.) horror release&nbsp;As Above So Below.&nbsp;&nbsp;The “found footage” horror story, set in the catacombs of Paris during an archaeological expedition, was produced for $5m by Legendary and is their first release with their new partner in crime. The film earned $8.3 million for the Fri-Sun frame and $10m for the holiday weekend, which is fine for the cheap horror entry which had few expectations heading into the weekend. &nbsp;The film played 50% female, 64% under-25 years old, &nbsp;34% Hispanic, 33% Caucasian, 15% African American, 9% Asian, and 9% “other.”&nbsp;It’s been a bad year for horror in terms of anything doing better than “not bad for costing $10 to produce,” so we’ll see if New Line’s&nbsp;Conjuring&nbsp;spin-off&nbsp;Annabelle&nbsp;can turn the tide at the start of the scary season.
								
										 
The other wide release,&nbsp;Pierce Brosnan’s&nbsp;The November Man&nbsp;actually opened on Wednesday, and it is released by Relativity which distributed the $20m old-school spy thriller. The Roger Donaldson picture, co-produced by SPD Films and Brosnan’s own Irish DreamTime which means we may get a sequel no matter how well it does, has earned $7.66m over the Fri-Sun frame, giving it around $10m for the 4-day holiday. Oddly enough, it is usually Focus Features that drops an R-rated, star-driven, adult-skewing genre entry during this long weekend to cap off the summer, as was the case with&nbsp;The Constant Gardener, The American,&nbsp;The Debt,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Closed&nbsp;Circuit&nbsp;in summers past. But this year Relativity gets the slot, and their college try has earned $9.35m thus far and should net around $11m by the end of the first six days, which is on the low end of “not terrible” for these releases. 
The somewhat surprising semi-wide release of the frame is Lionsgate‘s&nbsp;Catinflas, which debuted on 382 screens. The biopic about beloved Mexican actor&nbsp;Mario Moreno earned $2.62m Fri-Sun debut and $3.275m holiday frame. It’s another successful micro-targeted release from Pantelion Films and Lionsgate. With all the talk about the importance of Hispanic audiences, it would appear that Lionsgate is arguably the only studio making a real effort to target them accordingly. By all means, learn absolutely no lessons here. 
Ghostbusters&nbsp;was actually&nbsp;one of three reissues of sorts this weekend. Open Road Films also reissued Jon Favreau’s&nbsp;Chef&nbsp;into 652 more theaters (759 total) in the hopes that general audiences who are tired of summer blockbusters will check out that one crowd-pleasing food-porn indie they kept putting off. The film had $29m going into the weekend, by far the biggest indie triumph of the summer, and the reissue should push it over the $30m mark by Monday, which is arguably the point of the re-release. Oh, and Weinstein reissued&nbsp;Begin Again into 335 screens total, which added $1m to its cume and give the Keira Knightley/Mark Ruffalo music-tinged rom-dram around $16.5m by Monday. 
In terms of holdover news,&nbsp;Walt Disney's&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;again topped the box office.&nbsp;Guardians&nbsp;earned $16.31 million on its fifth weekend, down just 6% from last weekend, for a probable $19m Fri-Mon total. The Marvel Studios adventure passed the $259m domestic gross of Marvel’s&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;on Friday to become 2014′s top domestic grosser, at least until however long it takes for&nbsp;Hunger Games: Mockingjay part I&nbsp;to surpass where Guardians&nbsp;ends up&nbsp;(I give it to the first weekend in December). With $274.6m total today and around $278m by Monday, the strong hold all-but-guarantees that the Chris Pratt adventure will be the first 2014 release to cross $300m domestic and puts the overall totals of Iron Man 2&nbsp;($312m) and&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;($318m) in real peril. The film has made $547m worldwide, which means that the $700m mark isn’t a guarantee at this point. We’ll see…&nbsp;
										
										 
Paramount’s (Viacom)&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;is no chump either, with $11.7 million for the Fri-Sun frame and $15.5m for the Fri-Mon frame. The $125m Paramount reboot will end the holiday with a robust $166.1m. Hitting $200m domestic is not entirely out of the question if it can hold onto theaters during a relatively slow early September. The adjusted-for-inflation total of TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze&nbsp;($152m) is in the rear-view mirror.&nbsp;If I Stay held up okay in its&nbsp;second weekend, as the Chloe Moretz drama earned $9.6m (-41%) and $11m over the holiday frame. That gives the $15m Warner Bros (Time Warner) release $32m in eleven days.&nbsp;Into the Storm&nbsp;earned another $2.5m (-35%)over the Fri-Sun frame and crossed $40m domestic yesterday. 
Hercules&nbsp;crossed $70 million domestic while Transformers: Age of Extinction&nbsp;sits with $244m.&nbsp;20th Century Fox’s Lets Be Cops&nbsp;earned $8.2 million on its third weekend. Expect a $9-$10m holiday weekend, which should give the $17m comedy around $59m by Monday.&nbsp;When the Game Stands Tall&nbsp;should earn around $5.6m on its second weekend (-33%) and $7.3m over the long holiday, which would bring its cume to $18m by Monday.&nbsp;The Giver&nbsp;earned $5m on its third weekend and $6.5m over the holiday frame, bringing its total to $32m. 
The Hundred-Foot Journey&nbsp;is holding strong as the adult-skewing film of choice over the end of summer (ironic considering it’s the only one rated PG). The $22m Disney/DreamWorks release should earn around $5.8m over the long holiday and crossed the $40m mark domestically.&nbsp;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&nbsp;earned just $2.1m on its second weekend, a &nbsp;drop of 60%. It has now earned $11m and will surely finish with less than the $29m that the first Sin City&nbsp;scored on its opening weekend.&nbsp;The Expendables III&nbsp;earned a $3.5m third weekend (-46%). The action sequel now has $33.1m, which is just under what the first&nbsp;Expendables&nbsp;snagged on its opening weekend. 
Join us next weekend for another earthshakingly dull weekend, with just a single new release, Freestyle Releasing’s&nbsp;The Identical, opening on 1,400 screens. Paramount is also offering an IMAX reissue of Forrest Gump&nbsp;for the film’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, just maybe, one of the four movies set for September 19th (Tusks,&nbsp;A Walk Among the Tombstones, The Maze Runner, and&nbsp;This is Where I Leave You) should have planted itself on September 6th. 
* That joke came from DVD Talk critic and Shark Tank writer Tyler Foster as a comment left on my Facebook feed, but it was too good and too appropriate not to steal.
