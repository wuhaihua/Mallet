UK Mother Abandons Children To Join ISIS UK Mother Abandons Children To Join ISIS &nbsp;&nbsp;		
	An unemployed mother who dabbles in witchcraft has abandoned her two children to wage jihad with her 20-year-old husband on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
Sally Jones, 45, reportedly left the U.K. last year to meet up with her jihadi husband &#8212; a suspect in the beheading of American journalist James Foley &#8212; in the ISIS-controlled province of Raqqa, Syria, the London Evening Standard reports.

Jones, aka Sukinah Hussain, was a conspiracy theory and witchcraft forum commenter, and used to play in a punk girlband. Neighbors told the Standard she&#8217;s a &#8220;nightmare,&#8221; and claimed to be able to talk to spirits on Facebook.
The Standard tweeted this composite image &#8212; the photo on the left was posted to her Facebook and the other her Twitter account:

Before he left the U.K. to join ISIS, her husband, Junaid Hussain, spent six months in jail in 2012 for publishing Tony Blair&#8217;s address book online and bothering a counter-terrorism hotline. He&#8217;s now busy &#8220;refreshing his &#8216;kaffir killing skills,&#8217; she tweeted according to the Standard, and she is eager to behead Christians &#8220;with a nice blunt knife.&#8221; 

Her brother told the Standard her family is distressed. &#8220;She fell in love and went away,&#8221; he said.Â Jones left behind two sons, ages 10 and 14.
