L&T commissions 7.52 MW rooftop solar unit in Punjab L&T commissions 7.52 MW rooftop solar unit in Punjab 
L&amp;T Construction said&#160;it has commissioned&#160;a&#160; large rooftop solar plant of 7.52 MW at Amritsar.


More than 30,000 panels have been erected on the rooftop of a shed spread over 94,000 sqm.


The energy generated from the unit is being fed to the local grid through a power purchase agreement (PPA)&#160;with the state distribution company under the New and Renewable Sources of Energy (NRSE) Policy.


L&amp;T said it has used the multi-crystalline module technology and central inverters to optimise efficiency.


Since the modules were to be placed on fragile asbestos roof sheets, lightweight aluminium structures were used for mounting the modules and water proofing techniques followed to avoid leakage.


L&amp;T said it has also erected a permanent network of aluminium walkways on top of the roof sheets to create a safe working environment for execution, operation and maintenance.


S. N. Subrahmanyan, Senior Executive Vice-President (Infrastructure and Construction), L&amp;T said, &#8220;This is a significant step towards establishing our credentials as the country&#8217;s largest and leading solar EPC company.&#8221;
