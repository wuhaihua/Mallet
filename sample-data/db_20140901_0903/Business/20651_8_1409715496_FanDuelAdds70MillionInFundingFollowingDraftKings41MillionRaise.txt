FanDuel Adds $70 Million In Funding Following DraftKings $41 Million Raise FanDuel Adds $70 Million In Funding Following DraftKings $41 Million Raise A leader in the daily fantasy sports market, Fan Duel, has raised $70 million in Series D funding. &nbsp;The raise, led by Shamrock Capital Advisors with involvement by NBC Sports Ventures among other venture capital and private equity firms, comes only days after FanDuel rival DraftKings received $41 million in its Series C round. 
“This level of investment from Shamrock, NBC Sports, KKR and our existing investors is a testament to FanDuel’s leadership in the one-day fantasy sports industry and the growth potential within this space,” said Nigel Eccles, CEO of FanDuel. &nbsp;”We couldn’t be more pleased to be able to make this announcement at the start of football season, as more users begin to embrace the one-day fantasy experience.”
	
								 
The huge infusion of capital is a giant leap from FanDuel’s $18 million in existing funding and will allow FanDuel to increase its roughly 80 employees currently under contract. &nbsp;With a stated $10 million in weekly contest payouts, it will give FanDuel some added comfort as the platform continues to bring in and pay out exorbitant amounts of money per week. 
Daily fantasy sports consultant Michael Rathburn says it is an “unbelievable accomplishment for both FanDuel and DraftKings&nbsp;showing the metrics and growth needed to show investors why they should be jumping in at this scale. &nbsp;Believe it or not, I think FanDuel releasing their numbers a few months ago probably got DraftKings their raise, then DraftKings’ raise got FanDuel this one. &nbsp;For as much as they are rivals, they are also in this together for now.”
								
										 
In June 2014, FanDuel made some of its financial information open to the public and provided a projection of $40 million in revenue for the year. 
In response to a request for comment, DraftKings, Inc. Vice President Femi Wasserman stated, “DraftKings would like to congratulate FanDuel on their impressive round. &nbsp;The influx of investment in the sector bodes well for consumers, and we’re almost as excited to see FanDuel’s new offerings as we are to unveil ours.” 
The quote from Wasserman is proof that while FanDuel and DraftKings are ultimate rivals, even resorting to litigation based on alleged false advertising efforts, they are also parading each others’ efforts and success in recent capital raises. 
“[This] reminds me a lot of ‘DOT.com’ in mid to late 90s when Wall Street just backed Amazon regardless, because they saw the potential growth and payoff,” added Rathburn. &nbsp;”Without this rivalry, the industry would not have grown like this so fast.” &nbsp;Rathburn also made a comparison to the ‘Wrestling Wars’ in the 1990s between WWF and WCW. &nbsp;”Eventually there will probably be one winner. &nbsp;Right now, it’s too early in the game to say who, but eventually, investors are going to want to see both sites operating closer to the black.”
										
										 
There are more than 41 million people participating in fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada&nbsp;according to industry demographics provided by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. &nbsp;While that number is nothing to scoff at, the industry is convinced that much more growth is plausible largely based on turning players from passive to more active participants. 
The next big coup for the daily fantasy industry may be about more than simply expanding their user bases. &nbsp;It could be the introduction of corporate sponsors who are able to effectively pitch their products and services to fantasy players. 
“I’m waiting for corporate sponsors to start subsidizing some of these contests,” said Rathburn. &nbsp;”I cant say who, but I know two major companies who already have relationships with the NFL [and] are very serious about using daily fantasy sports as a marketing platform as early as 2015. &nbsp;Do we see a Super Bowl ad for daily fantasy sports this year? &nbsp;I think so.”
