Finnish Nuclear Plant Further Delayed Until 2018 Finnish Nuclear Plant Further Delayed Until 2018 Finnish utility TVO says construction of the country's fifth nuclear reactor has been delayed again, with the plant not expected to go online until 2018 — nine years later than initially forecast.French-German engineering conglomerate Areva-Siemens is building the reactor, which has been plagued by delays over faulty materials and planning problems since construction began in 2005.The 1,600-megawatt European Pressurized Reactor — one of the first of its kind — was meant to begin providing electricity in 2009.TVO says "it is hard for us to accept such a late startup forecast" and is seeking ways to speed up the work.Monday's announcement represented at least the eighth delay at the Olkiluoto 3 site, where two other reactors have been operating for more than 30 years.
