Nigerian Millionaire Oil Tycoon Loses $12 Million To Fraudulent Employee Nigerian Millionaire Oil Tycoon Loses $12 Million To Fraudulent Employee Nigerian multi-millionaire oil tycoon and former defense minister, Theophilus Danjuma, has been defrauded by one of his employees to the tune of $12 million. 
According to Nigeria’s Punch newspaper, Manasseh Obadiah Zorto, who previously served as a special assistant to Danjuma, embezzled the sum from Tita-Kuru Petrochemicals Limited, T.Y Holdings Limited and Central Realities Limited, all companies owned by Danjuma, who is one of the wealthiest men in Africa.
	
								 
A charge filed in a Federal High Court in Lagos on Friday stated that Zorto used his position as Executive Director of Tita-Kuru and special assistant, finance and investment to Danjuma, to carry out the fraud. He could not be arraigned in court as he is currently on the run. Zorto, 48, previously served as a General Manager of the United Bank of Africa before joining Tita-Kuru Petrochemicals in 2007. Among other assets, Tita-Kuru owns a significant stake in Notore Chemical Industries, Nigeria’s largest producer of urea fertilizer. 
 
Danjuma, 75, who is worth at least $700 million by FORBES’ estimates, is the chairman of South Atlantic Petroleum, a Nigeria-based upstream oil and gas exploration and production company that owns assets in West, Central and East Africa.
