‘Knockout Game’ Attacker Asked Man If He Had A Gun Before Punching ‘Knockout Game’ Attacker Asked Man If He Had A Gun Before Punching A teenager playing &#8220;knockout game&#8221; punched a Florida man in the face after making certain he was not carrying a gun, the victim told police.
According to a witness who saw the attack unfold, a teenager approached a man who was walking alone on Neptune Beach on July 31, the Florida Times-Union reported Friday.
According to the victim, the teen, who was with three accomplices, asked him if he had a &#8220;glock.&#8221;
While Glock is a weapons manufacturer, the term &#8220;glock&#8221; is also used generically to describe any type of handgun.
After the man said that he did not have a weapon, the teen punched him in the face.
Instances of the &#8220;knockout game&#8221; have been widely reported in cities across the country over the last several years. Carried out most often by teenagers &#8212; usually in groups &#8212; the goal of the so-called game is to knock a target unconscious. Several people have died during the attacks.
Fearing that outcome, the victim pulled out a folding knife that he was carrying and pretended it was a gun, according to the Florida Times-Union.
The attackers fled down the beach but were soon apprehended. The victim identified his attacker, who turned out to be 15-years old.
