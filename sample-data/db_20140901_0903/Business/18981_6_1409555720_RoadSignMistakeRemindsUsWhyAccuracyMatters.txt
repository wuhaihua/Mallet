The pictured road sign was displayed in the centre of Oxford in the UK. Note that &#8220;September&#8221; is not one of those words which has a spelling that differs from its pronunciation. This is just a stupid error, and one which suggests very little checking at any level of the sign production process.
It also has consequences: Oxfordshire County Council has made it clear it won&#8217;t be paying the company that produced the sign for this particular effort. Accuracy matters &#8212; and inaccuracy can cost you money.
