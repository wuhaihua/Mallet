China Eastern Airlines Sees Profits Plunge Nearly 100% In First Half China Eastern Airlines Sees Profits Plunge Nearly 100% In First Half It’s going to be a rough day for investors in China Eastern Airlines stock. &nbsp;Good thing for the ADR holders in the U.S. that the market here is closed on Monday. &nbsp;The stock opened 0.4% lower in Shanghai on Monday but rose by the same amount in Hong Kong. Its ADRs settled 2.5% lower on Friday. 
Recent earnings numbers could hit the stock if investors have not already priced in a rough first half. &nbsp;The company is trading at nearly 14 times trailing earnings, right around the same as Lufthansa in Frankfurt and much more expensive than Delta Airlines, which is trading at around three times.
	
								 
China Eastern&nbsp;posted a whopping 97.7% plunge in net profit in the first half of 2014.&nbsp;Its net profit of 14 million yuan (a relatively paltry $2.3 million) was made on revenue of 42.59 billion yuan in the first six months, up 2.68% from the same period of last year, according to a statement the airline filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange this weekend. 
The airline attributed the lackluster performance to “geopolitical instability, fewer high-end business travelers and more convenient high-speed railway services.”
