Britain's Barclays to sell Spanish assets to Caixabank Britain's Barclays to sell Spanish assets to Caixabank MADRID (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) is selling its Spanish retail and corporate banking operations to Caixabank (CABK.MC), the two lenders said on Sunday, as it continues a major restructuring and shrinks some of its struggling European divisions.Caixabank, Spain's third-biggest lender and one of the most acquisitive banks in the country during the recent financial crisis, said it would pay 800 million euros ($1.05 billion) for the Barclays businesses.The deal also includes wealth management operations and Caixabank said the final price would depend on the net asset value of Barclays Bank in Spain by the end of the year, when the transaction is due to close.Barclays is in the midst of a major turnaround plan involving thousands of job cuts and the closure or sale of business it now considers non-core as it tries to lift profitability.It began sounding out potential buyers for parts of its Spanish business in May this year after saying it would park its retail banking operations in Spain, Italy, France and Portugal in a "bad bank" so they could be sold, separated or floated.The bank is refocusing on its British and African businesses, credit cards and investment banking in Britain and the United States.Like other banks seeking to exit retail banking in Spain, such as Citigroup (C.N), Barclays will keep its investment banking division in the country.The deal with Caixabank does not include Barclays' credit card operations in Spain, the banks' announcements said.(Reporting by Sarah White; Editing by David Goodman)
