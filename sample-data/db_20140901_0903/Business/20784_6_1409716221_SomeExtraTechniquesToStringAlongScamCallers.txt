Regular Lifehacker contributor Alex Kidman recently beat his own record and kept a scam caller online for 1 hour and 17 minutes, which deserves praise in and of itself. Some of the extra techniques he used:

Claiming his PC had experienced a blue screen of death
Claiming 316 updates had to install before he could reboot
Pretending to type in web addresses but not understanding you need full stops in them
