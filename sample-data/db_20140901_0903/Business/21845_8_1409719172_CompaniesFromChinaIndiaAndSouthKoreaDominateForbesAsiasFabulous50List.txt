Companies From China, India And South Korea Dominate Forbes Asia's Fabulous 50 List Companies From China, India And South Korea Dominate Forbes Asia's Fabulous 50 List HDFC Bank makes the list more times than any other company&nbsp;  
SINGAPORE (August 28, 2014) – Companies from China, India and South Korea dominate this year’s Forbes Asia’s Fabulous 50 list of the region’s best big publicly traded companies. The ‘Fab 50’ list is an annual honor roll highlighting some of the brightest stars in the Asia Pacific. The full list can be found here and in the September issue of Forbes Asia, available on newsstands now.
	
								 
China boasts the most companies on the list, as it has for the last three years. But the number fell to 16, down from 20 last year and 23 the year before. The country’s real estate slump knocked off all of the property developers, which habitually make the list. However, tech companies made a strong showing, with Tencent the most valuable, having a market cap of $155.6 billion, nearly twice that of runner-up Tata Consultancy Services. Lenovo is the biggest in terms of annual revenue – $38.7 billion, just edging out India’s Tata Motors. 
India has 12 companies on the Fab 50 list, the same number as last year. HDFC Bank, the country’s second-largest private sector bank, appears on the list for the eighth year, the most times of any company on the list since Forbes began compiling this roster in 2005. Other notable companies from India include HCL Technologies, which makes the list for the fifth time, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, which appears on the list for the third consecutive time. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra also rejoins the list after a two-year absence.
								
										 
South Korea has 6 companies on the list, 3 more than last year. Naver, the country’s largest online search portal, made the list for the sixth straight year. Logistics and shipping company, Hyundai Glovis, made the list for the fifth straight year. 
Casino kings Galaxy Entertainment Group and Melco Crown Entertainment represent Hong Kong once again. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the famous jewelry chain, breaks into the Fab 50 list for the first time. Started in 1929, it is the world’s largest jeweler by stock market value and is controlled by the family of Cheng Yu-Tung, Hong Kong’s fifth richest with a $15.5 billion fortune. 
Japan has two companies back on the list this year, after not having any companies in the roster for the last two years. Suntory Beverage &amp; Food, which sells bottled teas and fizzy drinks, as well as Unicharm, Japan’s No. 1 in feminine hygiene products and baby diapers, are newcomers to the list. The Japanese beverage giant debuted on the Fab 50 list after raising $3.9 billion in an IPO in July last year. It now has a new U.S.-based sister company, Beam Suntory, thanks to parent Suntory Holdings’ $16 billion purchase of the producer of Jim Beam bourbon in April. 
Australia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore each have two companies on the Fab 50 list this year. CWT, the largest logistics company listed in Southeast Asia, appears on the list for the second straight year and as the cover story of the latest issue of Forbes Asia. The once emerging Singapore port logistics company has become a powerhouse under Loi Pok Yen, who took over from his father in 2005.
										
										 
A notable newcomer is Malaysia’s IHH, which breaks into the Fab 50 for the first time. IHH leads a pack of private-hospital operators in the region providing more choices to the increasingly affluent middle class. 
The Fab 50 companies are selected from a pool of 1,300 publicly listed companies in the region with at least $3 billion in annual revenue or market capitalization. Since only public companies are considered, prominent privately held companies such as Alibaba Group and Huawei Technologies are not included. Companies are analyzed for a long series of performance measures, including revenue, profits, return on capital, share-price movements and outlook. The list excludes companies with too much debt or where the government owns at least half of the shares. The result is the region’s best of the best.
