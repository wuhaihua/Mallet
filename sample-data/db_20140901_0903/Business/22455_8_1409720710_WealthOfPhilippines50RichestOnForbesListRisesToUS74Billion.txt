SINGAPORE (August 28, 2014) – Fortunes expand for some of the Philippines richest people, according to the latest Forbes Philippines rich list. The nation’s 50 wealthiest are worth a combined US$74 billion, up 12% from $65.8 billion in 2013. &nbsp;The complete list is available here as well as in the latest issue of Forbes Asia, available on newsstands now.
	
								 
Henry Sy tops the list for the seventh consecutive year with a net wealth of $12.7 billion, up $700 million from last year, largely thanks to the rising share prices of his SM Prime Holdings, the Philippines’ largest mall operator, and Banco de Oro, one of the country’s largest banks. Lucio Tan remains in the No. 2 spot with a net worth of $6.1 billion. Port and casino tycoon, Enrique Razon Jr. also saw his wealth rise to $5.2 billion, up from $4.5 billion a year ago, ranking him No. 3 on the list.&nbsp; The casino chief is placing a big bet on expanding his Solaire Resort &amp; Casino and is eying future expansion plans in Macau, Japan and Latin America. 
This year’s list reflects two driving forces of the Philippines’ economy: construction and consumption. Riding high on the country’s prosperity is Manuel Villar of Starmalls, operator of huge shopping centers. His net worth reached $1.46 billion, up $410 million from a year ago, to No. 14. &nbsp;Real estate developer, David Consunji, the founder of DMCI Holdings, also added more than $1 billion to his net worth to $3.9 billion (No.6). Strength in DMCI stock helped to boost the construction tycoon’s fortunes.

Po and family of canned food company, Century Pacific Group (No. 21, $770 million); Dean Lao, co-founder of D&amp;L Industries (No. 26, $625 million); Raul and Jose Concepcion and family, twin brothers who took over their father’s manufacturing and food businesses, Concepcion Industrial and RFM Corporation (No. 34, $320 million); and pawnshop titan P.J. Lhuillier of Cebuana Lhuillier,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (No. 49, $180 million).
