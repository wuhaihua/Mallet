English Premier League Transfers Smash Through Billion Dollar Barrier English Premier League Transfers Smash Through Billion Dollar Barrier In a frantic last day of trading, English Premier League soccer clubs set a new record of &pound;835 million ($1.4 billion) for their summer signings. 
&nbsp;
	
								 
This figure blasted through the billion dollar ceiling for the first time in history, thanks to massive hikes in broadcast revenue.&nbsp; The previous highest figure was &pound;630 million in 2013 – worth $945 million at the time. 
&nbsp;
								
										 
Highest spending club was Manchester United, who are seeking to turn around dismal recent results through spending big.&nbsp; The club acquired Argentinian striker Angel di Maria for &pound;59.7 million ($100 million) from Spanish club Real Madrid in a new British transfer record. 
&nbsp; 
The famous Manchester club also bought Dutch defender Daley Blind for &pound;13.8 million ($23 million) and brought in Colombian striker Radamel Falcao for &pound;6 million ($10 million) on loan. 
&nbsp;
										
										 
Players leaving the club included England national striker Danny Welbeck, acquired by Arsenal for &pound;16 million ($26.5 million).&nbsp; The London club also bought Chilean sensation Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona for &pound;35 million ($58 million), indicating that a new free spending era may be starting at Arsenal after some years of austerity. 
&nbsp; 
The galaxy of international stars preparing to shine in the English Premier League is in stark contrast to the woeful performances of the English national team, who failed to win a single match at the Brazilian World Cup this summer. 
&nbsp; 
Critics of the team argue that domestic players have been neglected in favour of expensive imports and various quota systems have been tried to encourage investment in ‘home grown’ players, without noticeable effect. 
&nbsp; 
But for the Premier League’s millions of spectators and TV audiences, who span the globe, the attraction is to watch the world’s best competing with one another, not to foster English talents.&nbsp; And the players themselves are clearly attracted by the wages they are offered. 
&nbsp; 
Angel di Maria is reportedly earning &pound;300,000 ($500,000) per week.&nbsp; Applied year-round, that would mean that he earned more than the NBA’s LeBron James, but less than Kobe Bryant.

This is possible because the Premier League is now broadcast in 212 countries, reaching 643 million homes and a total audience of 4.7 billion people, an 11 per cent increase on 2013 according to the league itself. 
&nbsp; 
This makes football a highly profitable export for the UK, worth &pound;1.2 billion ($2 billion) per year in TV revenue alone.&nbsp; Around 750,000 overseas visitors come to England to watch matches every year, part of the 14 million total attendance across the league for the 2013/2014 season. 
&nbsp; 
The combination of skill, speed and strength that the best footballers display is truly awesome and they’re worth every penny to their clubs.&nbsp; We’re living through a golden era of English football and should relish every moment.
