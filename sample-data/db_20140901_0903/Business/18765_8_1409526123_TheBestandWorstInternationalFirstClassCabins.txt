The Best (and Worst) International First Class Cabins The Best (and Worst) International First Class Cabins The airfare booking service flightfox recently released a study on the best International First Class Cabins as compiled by their research team. Their data suggest that the best international cabin is provided by Singapore Airlines, which offers lavish, shared suites that can fold out into an entire bed. Rounding out the list of top international airlines were:  
 
  
 Cathay Pacific First Class Suites 
 Emirates First Class Suites 
 Etihad Diamond First 
 Lufthansa First Class 
 
Rankings were compiled through a variety of (subjective) factors including seat dimension, food and wine offerings and niche amenities including pajamas and Champagne vintage. Also bearing weight was the “hackability” of the airline, or the basic ability of a flightfox expert to finagle a good deal on the carrier. Singapore Airlines had a hackability of 5/5.
	
								 
 
Another interesting datapoint aggregated by flightfox was the “best price” on each carrier, or the lowest price a consumer can pay to try out the first class product. On Singapore, one can pay $3324 to fly one-way between Mumbai and Singapore in a first class suite. On Cathay Pacific, the second best carrier, it’s possible to pay $713 to fly the short hop between Hong Kong and Taipei.&nbsp;Those rates naturally vary with seasonality and any fare sales on offer.
								
									 
Though much of the list from flightfox is fairly subjective, the service enlisted the help of community members to compare their rankings. Both the View from the Wing and the One Mile at a Time blogs contributed their own rankings for comparison and there were several correlations. Across the rankings, all parties agreed that Singapore and Cathay Pacific were the top two carriers. They also agreed that United was at the bottom of the list.
