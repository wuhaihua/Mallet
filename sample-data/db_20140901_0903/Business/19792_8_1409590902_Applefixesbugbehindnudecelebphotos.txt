"If this was the tool used, the hackers would have needed email addresses of celebrities. But it's possible that only one address is needed, allowing (hackers) to search inboxes for those of others in a domino effect."The weakness was reported in Saturday posts on GitHub, an online site for sharing computer code. On Monday, one of the GitHub posters reported that the bug, nicknamed "ibrute," had been fixed."The end of fun, Apple have just patched," read the GitHub posting.
