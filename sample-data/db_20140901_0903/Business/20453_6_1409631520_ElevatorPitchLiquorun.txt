Elevator Pitch: Liquorun Elevator Pitch: Liquorun 
Elevator Pitch is a regular feature on Lifehacker where we profile startups and new companies and pick their brains for entrepreneurial advice. This week, we&#8217;re talking with Joel Macdonald, Founder and CEO of Liquorun.
In 128 words or less, explain your business idea.
Liquorun is improving point-to-point logistics with an on-demand delivery platform that connects delivery drivers in your local area to anyone who needs anything delivered. Consumers open up the app and order anything delivered within their local city. From a case of beer to a piece of furniture delivered for a fraction of the time of the current industry standards. This is lifestyle meeting logistics. We are betting on the same way Uber made ordering a limo or private transport easier and more convenient.
What strategies are you using to grow and finance your idea?
We are currently testing out a lot of different mediums. We are having great traction with Facebook, Google AdWords and offline print (posters, flyers and fridge magnets).
What&#8217;s the biggest challenge facing your business?
Managing a three-sided market place has its challenges. There are a few more nuts and bolts to this business, but it actually gets easier as we scale. More volume means more and more drivers become confident with the commission-based fee structure.
How do your differentiate your business from your competitors?
More data collection enables us to pre load types of popular items in designated retail stores as well as understanding supply and demand periods to manage drivers with users needing our service.
What&#8217;s the best piece of business advice you&#8217;ve ever received?
You won&#8217;t learn from reading it &#8212; you will only learn from doing it!
