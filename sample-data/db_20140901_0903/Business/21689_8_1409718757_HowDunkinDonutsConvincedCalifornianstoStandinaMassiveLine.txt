Perhaps Californians (and the East Coast transplants who grew up with the chain) are just that desperate for Coolattas and Munchkins. But Dunkin’ offered additional incentives to help ensure a line-waiting spectacle. The first person in line outside an Apple Store leaves with the new iPhone; the first person in line for&nbsp;Santa Monica’s newest fast-food chain&nbsp;gets one year of&nbsp;free coffee. Dunkin’ also promised lesser freebies to first 100 customers, a marketing effort that appears remarkably effective. 
This isn’t even the first Dunkin’ Donuts location in California. The company recently opened a restaurant in Modesto up north and plans to open about 200 new restaurants in California over the next several years. and one day have more than 1,000 in the state.
