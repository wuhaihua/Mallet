Money Opportunities For Mo'Ne Davis Are Sizable But Potentially Fleeting And Risky Money Opportunities For Mo'Ne Davis Are Sizable But Potentially Fleeting And Risky Reader’s Note:&nbsp; Michael Barnes, the Director of the Sports, Arts &amp; Entertainment group at Anders CPA and Advisors based in St Louis, MO, was a guest contributor for this piece. 
After gracing this week’s Sports Illustrated cover, one would think that 13 year-old little leaguer, Mo’ne Davis, would have reached the height of her fame.&nbsp; But given the interest in the hard throwing girl from Philadelphia, it appears that bigger opportunities exist should she decide to embrace them.
	
								 
It is on her earning potential that these experts disagree. 
Sports marketing experts who have weighed in on the topic all agree that her family must strike now while the public interest in Mo’ne is strong.&nbsp; Paid speaking appearances, autograph signings, and corporate spokesperson opportunities all appear viable for Mo’ne.&nbsp; Given these options, estimates of $100,000 per year in such earnings have been stated, with long-term earnings possibly much greater.
								
										 
There are several tangible examples of her current appeal.&nbsp; A baseball autographed by her sold for $510 on eBay.&nbsp; A leading supplier of athlete autographs publicly stated that he would pay Mo’ne a minimum of $25,000 for an autograph signing, and that she could make several times that in the overall deal. 
Mike Heffner, the President of Lelands (the oldest sports auction house in the United States) estimated that her uniform from the Little League World Series could bring $25,000 or more were it to be sold at auction this fall.&nbsp; “Her stock right now is right up there with Derek Jeter”, he said, noting that such value can also be fleeting. 
Licensing opportunities also appear to be available to Mo’ne if LLWS team t-shirt sales are any indication.&nbsp; The United States champion, Jackie Robinson West, sold over 4,500 t-shirts at $20 each in the first two weeks, and an order of an additional 7,000 will be hitting its retailer, Dick’s Sporting Goods, this week according to Crain’s.&nbsp; Given a standard apparel / soft goods royalty on such clothing, Mo’ne could make thousands of dollars just on her own t-shirt. 
The commercial market for Mo’ne also appears to be buoyed by the fact that she is a female athlete competing directly against her male counterparts on an equal footing.&nbsp; We have seen the opportunities available to women who compete head-to-head against the men in all manner of sport, from driver Danica Patrick to Iditarod legend, DeeDee Jonrowe, to various lady golfers who teed up along side their male competitors.
										
										 
The question, however, seems to be whether she could partake of such opportunities given her stated desire to one day play basketball at the University of Connecticut.&nbsp; Her stepfather has already stated that he rejected an inquiry made regarding a book deal for Mo’ne out of concern over her future eligibility.&nbsp; These concerns are justified given the recent court decisions and now internal NCAA decisions concerning the compensation of athletes who still retain collegiate eligibility.&nbsp; Specifically, the NCAA has held in prior decisions that a collegiate athlete can be a professional in one sport, and still retain amateur status in another. 
Of course, if Jeffrey Kessler’s lawsuit versus the NCAA meets with the same success as the recently ruled upon Ed O’Bannon case, then Ms. Davis could be more aggressive in monetizing her brand.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that case won’t be resolved soon enough for her to capitalize on her present high-profile, which may be short-lived. 
Mo’ne’s reach as a product endorser could mirror that of a young Olympic gymnast or figure skater in terms of her targeted demographic reach.&nbsp; Her complete game 2-hit shut out performance on the mound brought a higher television rating than any MLB game on ESPN since 2007. &nbsp;Couple that recognition with her endearing persona, and she would appear to have a high ceiling as spokesperson. 
Ultimately, her and her family’s decision will be whether to take advantage of this opportunity, which would amount to risking her amateur status five years from now while simultaneously betting that the NCAA’s rules will change sufficiently over the same time.
