Danone Splits Chairman And CEO As It Ponders Future Danone Splits Chairman And CEO As It Ponders Future The decision by French food group Danone to separate the positions of chairman and CEO is a crucial step in preparing the next leadership of the group and allows the founder’s son Franck Riboud to concentrate on the strategy for the dairy, water and nutrition group. 
&nbsp;
	
								 
Emmanuel Faber will become chief executive officer. He was chief operating officer with Bernard Hours, who will leave the position. The board also created a strategy committee. 
&nbsp;
								
										 
“This change in governance, which will take effect on October 1, 2014, reflects Mr. Riboud’s&nbsp;desire to concentrate on the key strategic issues facing Danone in the medium and long term&nbsp;and to lay the groundwork for a smooth succession,” Danone said. 
It is good for Danone to separate the running of the business from the strategy. While the group is strong, sales and profits weakened in the first half of 2014 due to various reasons. It maintains a full-year target of a like-for-like net sales rise, a stable operating profit margin and 1.5 billion euros in free cash flow. 
&nbsp; 
The group has faced a few set backs recently. Its expansion plans in China received a set back by a recent baby food health scare due to a warning from supplier Frontera and were ham-strung for many years due to legal wrangling with partner Wahaha. France and Spain; still very large home markets, are in decline and the political stand-off with Russia could impact one of its biggest markets. Not to mention the short period of rumours of a bid by PepsiCo in 2005.
										
										 
&nbsp; 
For Danone, the search is for new growth and the strategic question is whether that needs to be done in a bigger Danone, with extended activities, or in an even more focused group. There have been media reports of a sale of the nutrition activities, which had been Riboud’s most-recent strategic enhancement of the Danone profile. 
&nbsp; 
Faber, 50, &nbsp;is sometimes described as a “warrior monk” based on his unrelenting efforts to drive down costs as well as his commitment for humanitarian causes and his engagement as a catholic. 
&nbsp; 
His elevation clarifies the current line-up for the “after-Riboud’ period. Not that he is likely to spend less time in his office. 
“I am 58 and have no desire whatsoever to retire in the Basque country or in Haute Savoie. I want to continue serving the group but I can have a far more efficient role by focusing on the main strategic issues,” Riboud told Le Figaro newspaper in an interview. 
&nbsp; 
“My predecessors have known big overhauls of their working environment, seen the change from the traditional shops to the large retailers. Today, we see an even bigger landslide with the rise of e-commerce and the digitalisation of the media. You cannot reflect on these changes without making the governance of the group capable of dealing with them,” he added. 
&nbsp; 
That sounds very reasonable indeed.
