DashNotes Quickly Saves Text, Images And Links To Chrome's New Tab Page DashNotes Quickly Saves Text, Images And Links To Chrome's New Tab Page 
Chrome: DashNotes snips and saves parts of the web in Google Chrome&#8217;s New Tab page, so you can refer to them later. Plus, it looks pretty, like a little pinboard.

Install the extension and you&#8217;re ready to start. DashNotes will save highlighted text, any links, or any image in a jiffy. Just right-click (on an empty space in case of web pages) and choose &#8220;Add to DashNotes&#8221;. The next time you open a new tab, it will show up there as its own pinned tile. The notes adjust width to fit the text.
There are already plenty of apps and extensions to supercharge the New Tab page, but DashNotes is a winner. It makes saving parts of the web fast and easy, and you don&#8217;t forget them in your vaults; it&#8217;s in your face every time you open a new tab.
