Fired Writer Gavin McInnes: Politically Correct Outrage Is Like The Mob Fired Writer Gavin McInnes: Politically Correct Outrage Is Like The Mob 						
	Writer, commentator and Vice magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes said that politically correct hysteria like the kind that recently cost him his job is similar to the mafia.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a real quandary people who write have to face right now,&#8221; McInnes told The Daily Caller. &#8220;Am I going to speak freely or am I going to hide?&#8221;
McInnes was recently placed on &#8220;indefinite hiatus&#8221; from his top creative post at New York-based Rooster ad agency, which he founded, after publishing an article on the writer&#8217;s forum Thought Catalog entitled &#8220;Transphobia Is Perfectly Natural.&#8221;
McInnes explained to TheDC how he feels that progressive celebration of transsexual culture &#8211; including online commenters pretending to be transsexual &#8211; only confuses the thought process of questioning teens. A thought process, McInnes noted, already complicated by the online slogan &#8220;Die cis scum&#8221; (&#8220;Cis&#8221; refers to a person who is not transsexual.)
If you&#8217;re looking for the text of that article, it&#8217;s a challenge. In Orwellian fashion, the link is now replaced on Thought Catalog&#8217;s website with a black screen and white type: &#8221;The article you are trying to read has been reported by the community as hateful or abusive content,&#8221; with a tiny &#8220;Continue&#8221; link toward the bottom that guides readers to the original piece. But you can still find liberal outlets celebrating McInnes&#8217; censoring and firing. Said the Huffington Post: &#8220;It looks like Gavin McInnes&#8217; actions have finally caught up with him.&#8221;
&#8220;It starts with a sea of insults on Twitter,&#8221; McInnes said, outlining the anatomy of a social-media PC firestorm. &#8220;Then your co-workers going Dude what&#8217;s the matter? Then it&#8217;s on a million blogs. Then it actually makes it into an actual newspaper. You see people on the street and you know they haven&#8217;t found out about it. It&#8217;s just these psychotic teens on Adderall.&#8221;
&#8220;They want a Hitler so bad. All I was saying was transsexuals have a huge suicide rate,&#8221; McInnes said before adopting the role of his opponents. &#8220;Gay people not killing themselves? That&#8217;s what the piece was about? Oh, fuck. Can&#8217;t you please hate one?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a culture of psychotic harassment,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s fake hysteria. It&#8217;s not that dissimilar from the mob.&#8221;

I inquired as to the PC outrage machine&#8217;s origins: is it a political weapon? A symptom of a dumbed-down culture filled with daytime TV hosts selling victimization and spreading over-sensitivity? McInnes said that it&#8217;s generational.
&#8220;It&#8217;s that college education has been ruined. If we lower the standards anybody can go. These colleges make up a class called Philosophy of Love. They&#8217;re actually dumber when they come out than when they went in. So you have these shrill college graduates 60 grand in debt and they&#8217;re terrified.&#8221;
&#8220;That was what was so great about [Andrew] Breitbart,&#8221; McInnes said, noting the late conservative icon&#8217;s spirited quest to puncture political correctness. &#8221;Norman Mailer used to fight. So would Buckley.&#8221;
McInnes, who was in Georgia shooting a movie at the time of the scandal, is not too concerned about his livelihood. But he bemoaned the plight of young writers starting out in an industry that you&#8217;d think would appreciate candor, and instead punishes it in storms of faux-moralistic activism.
McInnes is one of the few writers in America today willing to expose the mechanics of our P.C. outrage culture, and to deflate the idea that pro-censorship Internet hordes are doing anything righteous. Will mine be the first generation in history to gauge intellectual success as a measure not of challenging taboos, but rather of maniacally defending them?
Having been in this business a little while (and not always privileged, as now, to write only for Daily Caller readers), I think it&#8217;s fair to say that political journalism in the year 2014 can be adequately summarized in this clip. This episode of &#8220;Bethenny.&#8221; This is what one of our foremost writers Gavin McInnes just went through:
