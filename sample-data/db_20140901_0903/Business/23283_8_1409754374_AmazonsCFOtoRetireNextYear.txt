Amazon investors will have to get used to hearing a new voice deliver company news. 
The company announced early Wednesday that Thomas Szkutak, its longtime chief financial officer, will retire in June 2015. Szkutak joined Amazon in 2002 and has served as CFO ever since. 

During that time, Amazon went from having a market cap of about $5 billion in 2002 to just under $160 billion as of this week. The company's net sales in 2002 totaled $3.9 billion; its net sales in 2013 were $74.45 billion. 
“Tom’s impact over the past 12 years is evident in every part of our business. Under Tom’s stewardship, customers have benefitted from category expansion and geographical expansion, along with amazing new businesses like AWS and Kindle,” Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a statement. “The day Tom joined the company was a very lucky one for Amazon’s shareowners and customers and for all of us who’ve had the pleasure and fun of getting to work with him. We wish Tom and his family all the best in their next round of adventures.”
Szkutak isn't the only CFO of a major tech company to announce plans for his retirement this year. Apple's CFO Peter Oppenheimer announced his retirement earlier this year as well.
