Here Are The Most Important Energy Charts To Watch After Today's Plunge Here Are The Most Important Energy Charts To Watch After Today's Plunge After attempting to rally last week, the energy markets plunged today due to a sharp move in outside markets, particularly the currency and bond markets. The U.S. manufacturing report for August that was released today showed that manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in three years, which caused U.S. Treasury bond yields to spike and encouraged the dollar to appreciate even further against its peers. 
Strong U.S. economic reports typically strengthen the dollar and cause Treasury bond yields to rise because they increase the probability of further Fed policy tightening, including an earlier than expected Fed Funds Rate hike. The U.S. dollar and energy markets have a long-established inverse relationship, so dollar strength usually leads to lower energy prices.
	
								 
On Sunday, I discussed the energy markets’ attempt to stabilize and rebound after falling significantly during the summer. Late last week, West Texas crude oil broke above a downtrend resistance line that began in mid-July, but today’s sell-off caused crude to drop back below this line. Despite today’s sell-off, crude is still above its important $91.20 to $92.50 support zone that may create a floor under prices in the short-term. Crude oil may try to re-test this support and attempt another rebound. If this support zone is broken, however, it would increase the probability of another bearish move.

Similar to crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas tried to break above its $4 resistance level last week, but could not hold on to its gains. Natural gas is now back in its $3.74 to $4 trading range that started in mid-July. Commercial hedgers (who are considered to be the “smart money”) have accumulated a net long position of nearly 130,000 contracts since mid-June, which may be an indication that they expect a rebound during the fall season.
