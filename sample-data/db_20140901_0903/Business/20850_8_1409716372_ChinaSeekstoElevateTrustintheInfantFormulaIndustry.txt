China Seeks to Elevate Trust in the Infant Formula Industry China Seeks to Elevate Trust in the Infant Formula Industry If there is any class of food incidents in China that has caused the greatest outcry and fueled food regulatory reform, it is the infant formula incidents. The major incidents were in 2008 when melamine contaminated sickened hundreds of thousands of children, and four years earlier in 2004, when nutritionally substandard milk led to deformities in children. These incidents severely damaged the trust in infant formula produced in China, and led Chinese consumers to seek out foreign brands. Indeed, New Zealand’s Fronterra is planning to acquire a twenty percent stake in a Chinese infant formula company, Beingmate Baby and Child Food Company, continuing the trend of foreign-Chinese mergers in the food space. 
The Chinese government has issued a variety of policies and regulations meant to strengthen the regulation of the infant formula industry since 2008.&nbsp;These range from high level policy documents encouraging mergers of infant formula companies and strengthening regulatory supervision over quality control systems and supply chains to a recently adopted set of manufacturing requirements specifically for the industry.
	
								 
Most recently, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA or the Agency) is proposing to establish internal dossiers detailing the safety record of each infant formula manufacturer.&nbsp;According to a proposed rule that CFDA released in early August 2014, the Agency and its local counterparts will establish “infant formula manufacturer food safety credit files” for manufacturers. 
The file will contain three types of information: basic information, enforcement information, and information about social supervision.&nbsp; Basic information includes information about the food manufacturing license required in China for these entities, product information (including the product formula), ingredients, and labels.&nbsp;Enforcement information will include information about inspections, regulatory violations, product recalls, and communications with CFDA.&nbsp;Social supervision information will include consumer complaints, “feedback” from trade associations, and media exposes.
								
										 
And, what will CFDA do with all of this information?&nbsp;It’s not entirely clear.&nbsp;The proposed rule does not go into detail about how the Agency will evaluate the information in the files, or what it will make public.&nbsp;The only clarity in this respect comes from a vague provision that states that the Agency will evaluate the file, determine credit scores or grades, and create a graded system of enforcement against manufacturers depending on their score.&nbsp;The proposed rule also indicates that something about this system – either the scores or the graded system – will become public. 
These kind of ambiguities are sometimes where the good intentions behind these rules breakdown.&nbsp;The idea of a system like this that restores public trust and also rewards stakeholder compliance is, on many levels, a great idea.&nbsp;But it seems doubtful that this system going to deter conduct, if companies do not know how CFDA will score their file and what effect that will have on their operations.&nbsp;For example, CFDA plans to collect information on recalls, whether they were voluntary or ordered by the Agency, what products the manufacturer recalled, and when and how the manufacturer resolved the safety issue.&nbsp;But, does a manufacturer get more credit for immediately and voluntarily conducting a recall?&nbsp;Or is its score the same either way?&nbsp;If the latter is true, then manufacturers are not likely going to be encouraged to initiate recalls. 
And how will CFDA validate the information it receives?&nbsp;For example, how will it validate media exposes or consumer complaints.&nbsp;Who, if anyone, can request to see the files and ultimately to challenge or correct untrue information?&nbsp;If the goal is to direct enforcement resources at the right entities, then surely CFDA would want the procedures in place to ensure that the best possible information is in the file.&nbsp;If the answers to these questions are obvious from other rules or guidances, then why not say that in the proposed rule.&nbsp;If they are not worked out yet, then perhaps some the proposed rule needs work.
										
										 
The proposed rule is a good start to creating a mechanism to combat a significant problem in China.&nbsp;However, with little meat on the bones of this draft, it makes it difficult to determine what impact this will have in the future.
