Why The Energy Markets May Be At A Turning Point Why The Energy Markets May Be At A Turning Point The U.S. energy markets tumbled this summer due to a bearish combination of unusually mild weather, the strengthening U.S. dollar, and rising supplies. West Texas crude oil dropped by approximately 14 percent and Henry Hub natural gas fell just over 20 percent. In the past couple of weeks, both crude oil and natural gas have stabilized and broke above key technical resistance levels – a possible sign of a change of trend. 
Increasing tension in Ukraine and positive U.S. economic data helped crude oil bounce off of its $92.50 support level and climb above its downtrend line that formed in mid-July, which indicates that the rout is likely over for now. If crude continues to rally, $100 is the next most important resistance level to watch. Large traders have aggressively cut their net bullish position by approximately 180,000 contracts since late-June.

Natural gas began to stabilize and form a trading range pattern in mid-July, and broke above its $4 resistance level at the end of last week. Natural gas may attempt to rally from here if the $4 resistance breakout holds. Commercial hedgers (who are considered to be the “smart money”) have built a sizable net long position of nearly 130,000 contracts since mid-June, which may be a sign that they are expecting a rally as the fall season starts. Warmer U.S. weather in the past couple of weeks has helped natural gas prices rebound after a mild July and early-August.

The strengthening U.S. dollar in recent months has been an important bearish catalyst for energy prices, which trade inversely with the dollar. The dollar’s strength is driven by the ending of the Federal Reserve’s QE program this fall, expectations of upcoming Fed Funds rate hikes in early 2015, and the weakening euro as the European Central Bank considers launching a QE program of its own. The U.S. Dollar Index is approaching its $84-$85 resistance zone that may impede the current rally. In addition, commercial hedgers are accumulating a net short position on the Dollar Index, which may indicate their skepticism of the recent dollar rally.
