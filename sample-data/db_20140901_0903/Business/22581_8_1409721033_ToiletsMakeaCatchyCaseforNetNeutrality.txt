Toilets Make a Catchy Case for Net Neutrality Toilets Make a Catchy Case for Net Neutrality Thinkmodo, the New York-based creator of serial viral hits like the "Devil Baby" and "Bubba's Hovercraft," is getting serious.
Well, sort of.

The agency has released a plaintive plea for net neutrality, pitting the masses against greedy Wall Street types who seek to strangle the Internet with tiered pricing. The video features a bouncy number from Bobby Jo Valentine called "Don't Flush Our Rights Away," which sounds like it's off of Jack Johnson's Curious George soundtrack. It also features toilets, lots of them.
Shot in stop motion, the video shows a guy on a toilet with his pants down, heading to work and then spending some time in New York City's Washington Square Park with his girlfriend and visiting a bookstore before joining forces with others to take on the nefarious bankers.
The end of the video includes a shout out to Namecheap, the domain registry service, and NetNeutrality.com, a Namecheap-owned site that is designed to channel protests to Congress. The FCC is still mulling the issue and has extended its comment period until Sept. 15. 
James Percelay, principal of Thinkmodo, says the agency bought about 40 15-pound toilets (usually, they weigh well north of 60 pounds) and shot the video over the period of about a month. 
"We had all these people with underwear down to their ankles sitting on toilets, moving inch by inch," he says, noting that the sight drew crowds in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. "We realized that this visual metaphor resonated."
