People are more likely to want to hear negative feedback than feel like giving it. So schedule a weekly check-in with your colleagues or team where you appraise them of what&#8217;s going wrong, says Ethan Rasiel, CEO of Lightspeed Public Relations:

Often managers save up criticism for weeks or months and then pour it out all at once. It&#8217;s better to provide feedback &#8212; positive and negative &#8212; in real time,&#8221; he says. By giving regular feedback, you&#8217;ll become more comfortable giving it, and your team will be more prepared to receive it.

It&#8217;s an uncomfortable situation, but knowing how to give criticism and when to do it can help make your life smoother. By making it a part of regular routine, you take the pain and negativity away from it.
