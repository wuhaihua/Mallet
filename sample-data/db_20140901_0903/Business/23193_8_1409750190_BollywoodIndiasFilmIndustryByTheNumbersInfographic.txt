Bollywood: India's Film Industry By The Numbers [Infographic] Bollywood: India's Film Industry By The Numbers [Infographic] Amidst all the glamor and dazzle of Hollywood, people often forget about the world’s true movie capital – India. Firmly established in Mumbai, which was formerly known as Bombay (hence the Bollywood nickname), the Indian film industry is expected to grow to 138 billion Rupees by 2014 – that’s $2.28 billion. 
The numbers are certainly impressive - in terms of the number of films produced each year, Bollywood is firmly on top of the pile with 1,602 in 2012 alone. The U.S. churned out 476 films that year while the Chinese managed 745. In the same year, Hollywood sold 1.36 billion tickets compared to Bollywood’s whopping 2.6 billion. &nbsp;Indian films can’t match Hollywood in box office revenue, however. U.S. films grossed nearly $10.8 billion in 2012 compared to India’s meager&nbsp;$1.6 billion.
	
								 
People in India don’t tend to mind all those numbers though, they just want to watch films, something that can’t be disputed with nearly 2.7 billion cinema admissions in 2013!
