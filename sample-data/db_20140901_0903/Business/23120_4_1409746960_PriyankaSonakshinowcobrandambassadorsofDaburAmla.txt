The company also unveiled two new TV commercials with the two actresses endorsing together the Dabur Amla hair oil, which will go on air in two weeks, said Aditya Kayasta, Group Product Manager.


In its category, Dabur Amla has an 85 per cent market share with 35 million consumers. In the current organized market size of Rs 1,000 crore in amla-based hair oil in India, the 75-year-old brand from Dabur accounts for Rs 850 crore, he said.


Virtually relaunching the Dabur Amla brand, the company has also given its bottle a new look, introducing a flip-flop cap with a nozzle for easy application. &#8220;Our 14-year-old packaging has been given a new, contemporary look, making it more visible. The new PET bottle is sleek and curvaceous, designed to fit comfortably in the hand &#8221; he said.


Unveiling its relaunched, oldest and largest brand, the company said the new identity modernized the Dabur Amla brand, originally launched in 1940, making it more contemporary and relevant in consonance with modern lifestyle.
