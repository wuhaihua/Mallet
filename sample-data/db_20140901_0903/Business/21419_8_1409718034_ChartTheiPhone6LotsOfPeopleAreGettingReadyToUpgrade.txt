Chart: The iPhone 6 - Lots Of People Are Getting Ready To Upgrade Chart: The iPhone 6 - Lots Of People Are Getting Ready To Upgrade According to research conducted by ComScore, the owners of older iPhones are hotly anticipating Apple's latest handset. Indeed, the next iPhone is set to spark a spate of upgrades, with 46 percent of iPhone 3G/3GS owners planning to exchange their dusty old devices for something more innovative, speedy and shiny. 
Nobody knows (except of course for those busy people at Apple) if the potential new handset will even be called the iPhone 6. Nevertheless, a further 43 percent of iPhone 4 and 40 percent of iPhone 4S users are preparing to say goodbye to their old phones and embrace the next thing from Apple.
	
								 
Somewhat unsurprisingly, upgrade potential is much lower amongst the owners of newer iPhones – 36 percent of iPhone 5, 24 percent of 5S and &nbsp;just 15 percent of 5C owners are planning to make the switch to something newer. All eyes, especially those glaring at the dated screens of those now ancient iPhone 3Gs, will be glued to Apple’s launch event at Cupertino on September 9th.
