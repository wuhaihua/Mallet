According to indianboards.com, a joint initiative of Prime Database and NSE, as many as 755 out of a total 1,469 NSE-listed companies or 51 per cent of the companies, were still to appoint a woman director as on August 31.


This means that 25 of these yet-to-be-compliant companies are required to appoint one woman director every day this month.


Since February 13, when SEBI announced this stipulation, till August 31, 264 women have been appointed to 274 directorship positions.
