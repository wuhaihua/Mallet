Treasury I Savings Bond "Cliff Notes" Treasury I Savings Bond "Cliff Notes" Because I was one of the most vocal supporters of I Bonds when they were first introduced, I’m often asked for my thoughts on today’s I Bond offerings. The most common question I get is “Are today’s I Bonds a good investment?” 
While we can reminisce about the “good old days” when &nbsp;one could purchase up to $30,000 per Social Security number of paper I Bonds per year using a credit card and get a REAL yield of up to 3.6% over and above inflation, we’re faced with a different landscape today. So let’s take a look at what’s currently available.
	
								 
Here are some highlights for investors to consider:  
 
 How to Buy – I Bonds are purchased in electronic form from Treasury Direct at https://www.treasurydirect.gov/RS/UN-AccountCreate.do 
 They’re risk-free. &nbsp;You can never lose money. 
 Current yield is 1.94%&nbsp;. &nbsp;That’s not bad when you consider today’s low interest rate environment. 
 They protect against inflation. &nbsp;That’s definitely important for the long-term investor. 
 They’re tax deferred. This feature can help expand your tax-deferred space. 
 I Bonds are &nbsp;very flexible. They can be redeemed any time between one and 30 years.&nbsp; This can offer tax-shifting from one’s current high tax bracket to a lower tax bracket after retirement. 
 They’re free from state and local taxation when redeemed. This can be very important for investors living in high tax cities and states. 
 They can be tax free if used for qualifying educational expenses.&nbsp;However, to qualify for this tax-free benefit, the I Bonds MUST be titled correctly. The Bonds need to be titled in the name of one or both parents. The child can be named as a beneficiary, but CANNOT be named as an owner or co-owner. 
 Annual Purchase limits. Investors can purchase any amount from $25 up to the annual limit of $10,000 in electronic I Bonds per year per Social Security number. That’s up to $20,000 per couple per year. 
 Trusts. Investors can also purchase an additional $10,000 per year in electronic I Bonds for their trusts. 
 Paper I Bonds. You can get up to an additional $5,000 per year in paper I Bonds via your tax refund by attaching IRS Form 8888 
 Summary: Given today’s anemic yields and the flexibility and other nice features they offer, I Bonds are probably the best of the currently-available risk-free choices.
