Unveils new brand positioning&#8212; Forever Faster


Puma, which started off as a sports lifestyle brand in the country nine years ago and has consolidated its position in the space, is now looking to grow its India revenue with its performance portfolio that includes two categories &#8212; running and football. 

The company, whose revenue has been growing at 32 per cent annually over the last nine years, has been raking in high double digit growth rates in its running range over the last three years, and is looking to replicate that success with its football range, beginning 2015. 

Rajiv Mehta, MD, Puma India, told Business Line that even though the company was very strong in its performance portfolio globally, it started off with its lifestyle range in India in order to make a mark here. &#8220;We had great running shoes and a few other performance products, but our offering was limited. In 2012, we shifted our focus to performance, as we were fairly confident with our lifestyle positioning in the country. Globally also, we ran a campaign called &#8216;Nature of Performance&#8217;, and introduced some great products which we thought we should bring to India.&#8221;


Puma&#8217;s lifestyle range, priced from &#8377;2,000 to &#8377;20,000, currently contributes to 50 per cent of the company&#8217;s annual revenue, with the rest coming from the performance range, which is priced between &#8377;3,500 and &#8377;12,000. 

&#8220;I want our performance range to outshine our lifestyle range and get to 55 per cent of our overall revenue. People love to run. For them, running is not about competing, it&#8217;s about running for the love of it. With disposable incomes rising, people are taking to games like squash and badminton, all this is driving demand for our performance range,&#8221; said Mehta.


The company&#8217;s focus on the running category since 2012 successfully raked in high double digit growth and is expected to do well. 

&#8220;The football category promises to be what running was three-four years ago and we are going to invest a lot more into this starting 2015,&#8221; said Mehta. 

Puma has already sponsored the Bangalore Football Club and given them new kits, including shoes, socks, shorts and tees.


In line with the company&#8217;s mission to become the fastest sport brand in the world, Puma formally launched its new brand positioning &#8211; Forever Faster&#8212;with the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt, in the city on Tuesday. 

&#8220;The new brand positioning is about Puma reminding people that we are and will continue to be the fastest sports brand in the world,&#8221; said Mehta. 

Puma retails its merchandise from 310 stores in over 100 cities, of which 50 are company-owned and operated and 260 are franchisee-run. 

The company plans to open 15 more stores this fiscal.
