Wes Welker Hands Out $100 Bills After Kentucky Derby Win Wes Welker Hands Out $100 Bills After Kentucky Derby Win 						
	Denver Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker attended the Kentucky Derby and apparently bet big on winner California Chrome because he was spotted handing out $100 bills to random attendees as he was leaving the race.
One attendee Marc Blandford told For The Win that he saw the football star leaving and said, &#8220;Wes Welker, how ya doing?&#8221;
Welker then proceeded to dole out $100 bills to Blandford and others around him. Blanford said that Welker said he &#8220;just won the Kentucky Derby,&#8221; and &#8220;proceeded to walk down the line until the police officer stopped him.&#8221;
&#8220;He just won probably hundreds of thousands of dollars so he just started handing money to people like it was no big thing,&#8221; another witness Jeff Novak said.
If only we were all so lucky to be professional wide receivers, or win big at the Derby, or at least be standing near Wes Welker when he does.
