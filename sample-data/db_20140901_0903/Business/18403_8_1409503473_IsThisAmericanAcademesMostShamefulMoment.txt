Is This American Academe's Most Shameful Moment? Is This American Academe's Most Shameful Moment? Later this month the Chinese government will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of its worldwide network of Chinese-language training schools. Big deal, you might think, but it is not an anniversary that everyone is greeting with a yawn. 
&nbsp;
	
								 
Far from it. In an illustration of how complicated our globalized world is becoming, the anniversary is posing an acute dilemma for universities across the United States. More than ninety U.S. universities now host Beijing’s language training schools, which are known as Confucius Institutes. In so doing they accept Beijing’s money, and administrators and academic staff at such universities are under strong pressure to participate in Beijing’s rather synthetic “celebrations.” The problem is that if they go along with Beijing’s agenda, they risk casting themselves as patsies for a formidably authoritarian regime. Of course, they retain the right to ignore the anniversary, but for any university that accepts Chinese funding that would mean causing offense to their Beijing paymasters (and as China watchers know to their cost, Beijing has a long memory). 
&nbsp;
								
										 
What is undeniable is that the Confucius Institutes are highly controversial. In the view of many American critics, the institutes’ relationship to the Chinese government is far too close. Not only does this raise questions about the long-term future of academic freedom at host universities but there have been suggestions that the institutes have been engaging in industrial and military espionage, as well as surveillance of Chinese students abroad. 
&nbsp; 
Greatly compounding American academe’s discomfiture is that the Beijing government seems hell-bent on making the anniversary a high-profile statement of the speed with which Chinese influence is spreading in Western intellectual life.

Yet to say the least the idea of any self-respecting Western university accepting funding from a foreign government – let alone a government as brutally authoritarian as the Beijing regime – seems an oxymoron. &nbsp;All this notwithstanding, at least six American universities with Beijing-funded Confucius Institutes have already sufficiently swallowed their pride to announce plans to celebrate the anniversary. They include Michigan, Purdue, Florida, Rutgers, North Carolina, and University of California-Davis. Elsewhere in the world Sheffield in England and both Latrobe and Melbourne in Australia are also joining in the Made-in-China festivities. 
&nbsp; 
As Perry Link, emeritus professor of East Asian studies at Princeton, points out, there is something “embarrassing” about American universities being expected to celebrate this anniversary. After all, what is being commemorated is not the establishment of any U.S.-based Confucius Institute but rather the world’s first Confucius Institute, established thousands of miles away in Seoul, Korea in 2004. He comments: “There is no tradition for American universities to celebrate the founding of any of their departments, and most academic staff are only vaguely aware, if they are aware at all, of when their departments were founded.” 
&nbsp; 
For American university administrators perhaps the most embarrassing aspect of the whole affair is that Beijing has reversed itself on the hot-button issue at the center of the entire controversy. After vehemently denying for years that the Confucius Institutes have any kind of propaganda or censorship agenda, Beijing has now openly acknowledged that this was false. The admission was a tacit one but for any American university that hosts a Confucius Institute it was an extremely humiliating development. It came in July of this year at the annual conference in Portugal of the European Association for Chinese Studies, an event organized in part by a Portuguese Confucius Institute. On the orders of a top Beijing official, pages were ripped out of the conference program before it was distributed to participants. The official who gave the orders was Xu Lin, worldwide head of the Confucius Institute network. The offending pages bore references to Taiwan-based organizations that she considered “inappropriate.” 
&nbsp; 
In the view of Christopher Hughes, a top British China watcher who is based at the London School of Economics, Xu’s intervention marks a new, much more interventionist stage in the development of the Confucius Institutes. He comments: “Confucius Institutes are not academic institutions. In the wake of what happened in Portugal, it amazes me that anyone could continue to hold that these organizations do not have a political agenda.”
