Bania.io Maintains Your Productivity Chain With A Daily Email Bania.io Maintains Your Productivity Chain With A Daily Email 
Web: You can maintain a good habit by charting a success streak &#8212; an approach commonly known as &#8220;Don&#8217;t Break the Chain&#8221; Method (and often erroneously attributed to Jerry Seinfeld). Bania.io helps you log this streak with nothing more than a daily email.

It&#8217;s simple. Suppose you want to create a streak for going to the gym every day. Every day you go, you send an email to [email&nbsp;protected] That&#8217;s it. No sign-ups needed. Bania.io will reply with a monthly breakdown of your productivity chain, with shades of green marking how good you have been.
Of course, you can use any prefix instead of &#8220;WentToGym&#8221; and use multiple ones too. You probably want to keep it short and easy to remember, so [email&nbsp;protected] is the way to go. The service is free and secure. It&#8217;s gold, Jerry, gold!
