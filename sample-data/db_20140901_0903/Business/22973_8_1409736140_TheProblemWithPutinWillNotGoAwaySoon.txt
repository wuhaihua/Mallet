The Problem With Putin Will Not Go Away Soon The Problem With Putin Will Not Go Away Soon Despite almost daily drama on the ground in Ukraine and a busy diplomatic agenda as politicians tempt to tighten the sanction screws without resort to military intervention, the problem of President Vladimir Putin and his resurgent “New Russia” nationalistic drive to regain and expand the country’s sphere of influence will not go away soon. 
The situation is unlikely to be resolved before winter, as some hope, even if the fighting would abate in the east of Ukraine, and there could be years of tension and conflict with other flash points.
	
								 
Such a new geopolitical freeze, pitting Russia against the West once again, will have damaging consequences for the European economies, businesses and employment. 
It will be a severe stress test &nbsp;for the European Commission and the meetings of ministers that could solidify or destroy the continent’s institutions.
								
										 
Prolonged and extended sanctions will delay economic growth or even exacerbate an economic decline, adding to the headaches of the European Central Bank and probably weaken the euro which, in a way, could give some alternative export options to companies. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that sanctions needed to be strengthened to stop Russia from sending troops into countries and changing borders in Europe. “In my opinion, this is a much bigger risk than accepting certain disadvantages for businesses during a limited period,” Merkel told reporters. 
“I believe it is necessary to prepare such sanctions and that possible disadvantages in no way outweigh those resulting from doing nothing,” she added. 
British Prime Minister David Cameron&nbsp;has told European leaders behind closed doors that the West risked making similar mistakes in appeasing&nbsp;Vladimir Putin&nbsp;over&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;as Britain and France did with&nbsp;Adolf Hitler&nbsp;in the run-up to World War Two, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
										
										 
At the moment, sanctions are mainly limited to food stuff and a group of Russian individuals and some companies. The EU and United States are likely to extend this, to more sectors and including cultural and sporting cooperation, and could even exclude Russia from the SWIFT international payment system and, eventually, include energy in the package. 
The EU and the U.S. are unlikely to impose all possible sanctions at once as they need to keep some measures in reserve in case of any worsening of the situation. 
Trade with Russia is important for the European Union. According to the European Commission; 
&nbsp;  
 
  
  “Russia is the third trading partner of the EU and the EU is the first trading partner of Russia. 
  Trade between the two economies showed steep growth rates until mid-2008 when the trend was interrupted by the economic crisis and unilateral measures adopted by Russia, which had a negative impact on EU-Russia trade. Since 2010 mutual trade has resumed its growth reaching record levels in 2012. 
  EU exports to Russia are dominated by machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, medicines and agricultural products. 
  EU imports from Russia are dominated by raw materials, in particular, oil (crude and refined) and gas. For these products, as well as for other important raw materials, Russia has committed in the WTO to freeze or reduce its export duties.” 
  
 
The EU and Russia were in talks to widen a trade agreement, these talks are likely dead for now. 
Sanctions Take Time To Bite 
The problem with economic sanctions is that they are difficult to put in place and take time to have effect, even excluding any moves to circumvent the trading bans. 
“In my opinion the sanctions imposed end of July on Russia limiting also its access to EU capital markets were the right way to go. When I spent some days in Moscow in April this year talking to many different people there already was a kind of a consensus that only banking sanctions might be able to stop Putin,” said Bernhard M&uuml;ller-H&auml;rlin of German think-tank K&ouml;rber Foundation. 
“I would not say that the July’s sanctions have proven to be totally ineffective. However, unfortunately, sanctions tend to work in the long-term and not in the short-term. And Putin is acting on the short-term. So for the moment, these sanctions were not able to change his course,” he said. 
  “With locking Russia out of the SWIFT interbank payment system, we are talking now about the banking sanctions the West imposed on Iran. This is the most powerful instrument the West has as neither the U.S. or Europe do have any military options with regard to Russia. That is also the reason why Putin is acting the way he does. In the end, Ukraine knows that the West will not come for rescue. More powerful sanctions by EU countries as SWIFT would be to sanction Russian gas, but I don’t see this coming for obvious reasons.” 
“Anyhow this crisis will not be resolved in the near future. The last month have proven that this is and will remain Europe’s strategic issue number one for the years to come,” he added.

Consequences 
When the EU extends sanctions, Russia is likely to retaliate. That could make it hard for western companies to continue doing business in Russia, the “R” in the BRIC of fast-growing markets. Renault-Nissan controls AvtoVAZ, the country’s bigger car maker that sells Lada. BP has a stake in Rosneft and production deals, French bank BNP Paribas has a stake in broker TKB, Danone is the biggest dairy group in Russia, Germany’s Metro and France’s Auchan operate retail stores, etc. 
What will happen to the expatriates and the assets remains to be seen. There could be close control on western media and the exclusion of journalists. 
Companies from Polish apple growers, German engineering firms or French luxury companies will need to find other markets for their products or limit output. Reduced production will undermine growth or lead to economic decline, exacerbating the unemployment situation. 
For European governments it would become increasingly difficult to maintain austerity policies in the face of economic standstill or decline while postponing public debt reduction targets could weaken the euro exchange rate and dent investor confidence. Buyers of state debt would demand a higher risk premium, causing interest rates to rise and debt financing costs to increase. 
That would cause further turmoil in the delicate talks between EU leaders about coordinated fiscal policies and demand brinkmanship of the new EU executive, which is already asked to show unity and determination on foreign policy and security of a level never seen before. 
New commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, European council president Donald Tusk and EU foreign policy supremo Federica Mogherini will have their work cut out. Not only to make the fragile and sprawling EU institutions battle-ready, but also in assuring public support. 
It remains to be seen how long EU public opinion will support a firm stance against Russia if it leads to more unemployment, just as it is a question how long Russian public opinion and consumers will fully support Putin’s steps amid an economic fall-out in their country. 
Meanwhile peace talks could calm down the current crisis in Ukraine but will not solve the underlying question of geopolitical balance and the self-determination of free peoples. 
Putin is talking of “statehood” for southern and eastern Ukraine and rejects NATO ties with Kiev. The EU wants Russia to recognise the Kiev government and its territory. A deal is not likely soon.
