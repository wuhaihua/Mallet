DENVER&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211;September 3, 2014&#8211;
      WealthTouch Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;WealthTouch&#8221;), the global leader in       consolidated investment and total wealth reporting services to high net       worth family offices, RIA&#8217;s, and private banks, today announced it has       received the 2014 ACQ Global Award for International Niche Technology       Provider of the Year (Investment Reporting).    
      &#8220;We are excited to have an organization of ACQ&#8217;s caliber recognize the       contribution WealthTouch continues to make towards improving the       functional and social dimensions of complex, global investment       reporting. This award reinforces our reputation as market leaders in       this space and we appreciate the recognition it provides us,&#8221; said Craig       Pearson, President. &#8220;We remain focused on driving digital engagement so       that wealthy families around the world are fully empowered with the       critical information they need to exercise greater control and oversight       over their wealth.&#8221;    
      WealthTouch&#8217;s multi-asset, multi-custodial performance reporting       platform is at the core of the Company&#8217;s award-winning total wealth       reporting service. The state-of-the-art, highly interactive technology       platform seamlessly consolidates both investment and expense data across       all instrument classes and account structures in order to simplify and       streamline the inherent complexity of high net worth individuals&#8217;       finances. With one touch, users can quickly answer a range of critical       questions about every aspect of their portfolio, from total net worth       and asset allocation to activity, risk, and manager performance. As a       result, both families and their advisors are able to make better, faster       financial decisions.    
      Since 2008, the ACQ Global Awards have been celebrating achievement,       innovation and best practices in their annual awards. &#8220;Exceptional       individuals, teams and firms across the marketplace represent the very       best in their field from around the world and truly deserve the accolade       of being an ACQ Award winner,&#8221; said Jake Robson, Editor-in-Chief of ACQ.       &#8220;All category winners are, in effect, a brand. In one sense, perhaps the       most important sense, a brand is a promise. You know what you&#8217;re going       to get with a well-branded product or service. It takes a lot of time,       money and very hard work to build and maintain great brands, brands that       can speak volumes in just a few syllables. It&#8217;s shorthand for what you       are.&#8221;
