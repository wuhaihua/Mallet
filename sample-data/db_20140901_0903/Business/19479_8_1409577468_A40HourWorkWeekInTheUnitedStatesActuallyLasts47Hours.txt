A 40 Hour Work Week In The United States Actually Lasts 47 Hours A 40 Hour Work Week In The United States Actually Lasts 47 Hours According to a Gallup poll, the working week in the United States is almost a full working day longer than standard. While the 40 hour week is generally accepted as “normal,” adults employed full-time have reported working an average of 47 hours each week. 
This number has remained relatively steady over the past decade, with the exception of a slight dip to 44.9 hours in 2005/2006. Forty-two percent of respondents reported working a standard 40 hour week with a mere 8% working less than that. Twenty-one percent of Americans now work between 50 to 59 hours with 18% taking their weekly quota to 60 hours plus.
	
								 
Several factors are contributing to these gruellingly long work weeks, one of which is pay structure, according to Gallup. While hourly workers can face limits by employers trying to cut costs, those on a salary often work up to five hours a week more. Some people have also taken on a second job, contributing to time spent in the office.
