At record high again: Sensex hits 27000. Here's why At record high again: Sensex hits 27000. Here's why After hitting record highs on Monday, the Indian equity markets once again opened on a positive note this morning with the Sensex even touching 27000 at 12:55 pm. The market continues to ride high on optimism fuelled by current account data released yesterday, coming on the back of a better-than-expected GDP data last Friday.
A Bank of America Merril Lynch report said markets are likely to double from current levels in the next four years, tracking the trajectory of corporate earnings in the same period. India’s GDP growth for the three months to June came in at 5.7%, the fastest rise in 10 quarters, up from 4.6% in the January-March period.
So not only has sentiment been upbeat during the first 100 days of the new government, but the macro variables have also started to improve, suggesting a recovery in the economy. Rainfall, though sub-optimal, is turning out to be better than expected while the rupee has largely stabilised at about 60-a-dollar levels. Exports too are picking up and India's balance of payments was in surplus for a third straight quarter in April-June.
On the other hand, the government has fast-tracked decision making and announced several smaller measures though the equity market has been expecting some big-bang reforms. But the pace of reforms and policy action could pick up after the forthcoming assembly elections in some of the key states like Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir in October and November this year.
Also, in addition to strong foreign inflows of $30 billion into the equity market since beginning of 2014, there has been a significant foreign fund flow into the debt market as well which reflects the growing confidence of foreign investors in the Indian economy Mark Mobius' Franklin Templeton has pumped in close to Rs 16,000 crore into the Indian debt market in the past couple of weeks alone.
On Monday, the 30-share Sensex ended up 229 points at 26,868 after hitting a record high of 26,900 and the 50-share Nifty ended up 73 points at 8,028 after touching a record high of 8,035. The Bank Nifty also ended above 16,000 for the first time. As per the provisional figures on Monday, FIIs were net buyers of Rs 554 cr in the cash market, while they were net buyers of Rs 2176 cr in the F&amp;O markets. However, domestic institutional investors were net sellers of Rs 562 crore in the cash market.
