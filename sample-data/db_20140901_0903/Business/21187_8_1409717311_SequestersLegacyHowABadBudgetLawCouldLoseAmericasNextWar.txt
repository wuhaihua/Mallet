Sequester's Legacy: How A Bad Budget Law Could Lose America's Next War Sequester's Legacy: How A Bad Budget Law Could Lose America's Next War When the Budget Control Act became law in 2011, just about everybody agreed it was the wrong way to deal with deficits.&nbsp; In fact, one reason it won congressional approval was the widespread belief that fear of its consequences would force Democrats and Republicans to agree on more reasonable measures for righting federal finances.&nbsp; However, that did not happen, and now the political culture has settled into an expectation that, bad though it may be, the budget act will remain law into the next decade. 
If it does, the United States might lose the next big war it fights.&nbsp; In order to understand why, you need to grasp the state of the nation’s defenses when the act became law and the way in which it impacts various types of military spending.&nbsp; Contrary to what much of the media coverage has reported, the Budget Control Act does not impose “across-the-board” cuts on federal spending.&nbsp; It exempts from cuts most of the big entitlement programs that are the real drivers of budget deficits — entitlement spending will increase roughly a trillion dollars annually during the current decade — while disproportionately targeting defense.
	
								 
To make matters worse, it only targets some types of military spending, leaving pay and benefits for current and retired personnel — both military and civilian — largely unscathed.&nbsp; So the burden of generating $600 billion in budget savings over nine years falls mainly on the twin pillars of U.S. military superiority — readiness and technology.&nbsp; Other countries can match the U.S. in number of military units, but where they lag America is in areas such as warfighting proficiency, technological sophistication, and the sustainment of combat gear.&nbsp; It is these facets of military might that the Budget Control Act is rapidly unraveling. 
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has warned Congress repeatedly that if there is no relief from the requirements of the budget law — which uses a mechanism known as “sequestration” to limit the availability of money — then the U.S. will lose its warfighting edge.&nbsp; For instance, on February 24 of this year he stated in a press briefing that, “the only way to implement sequestration is to sharply reduce spending on readiness and modernization, which would almost certainly result in a hollow force — one that isn’t ready or capable of fulfilling assigned missions.”&nbsp; In other words, a force that might be defeated by a better-equipped and better-trained adversary.
								
										 
Many politicians and pundits don’t get this.&nbsp; They look at the fact that America is still outspending the next dozen military powers combined, and conclude the Budget Control Act isn’t all that bad.&nbsp; After all, the budget caps imposed by the sequestration process only cut $55 billion annually from a defense budget that this year will still total ten times that much when funding of overseas contingencies is included.&nbsp; The problem, though, is how and where the cuts occur, and what reductions had already taken place before the Budget Control Act became law.&nbsp; When you analyze how the act apportions cuts, it becomes obvious how the law could lead to military defeat.

Let’s take modernization as an example — the term Pentagon policymakers use for investing in new technology.&nbsp; Fielding advanced military technology has long been the most important way in which the joint force compensated for the numerical superiority of adversaries.&nbsp; But by the time the Budget Control Act was implemented, the joint force had already experienced several waves of reductions to its technology budget.&nbsp; First, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney terminated a hundred weapons programs when the Cold War ended — everything from the Seawolf submarine to the B-2 bomber. Then the Clinton Administration repeatedly deferred a promised restoration of military investment outlays.&nbsp; Then defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s plans for “military transformation” were derailed by the global war on terror. 
The last stage of this downward trajectory in technology spending prior to passage of the budget law came during the first Obama Administration, when defense secretary Robert Gates canceled a slew of major weapons programs ranging from the Air Force’s F-22 fighter to the Navy’s missile-defense cruiser to the Army’s planned family of networked combat vehicles.&nbsp; The administration later acknowledged that virtually all of the savings it had generated in the military budget during its first two years in office came from cutting outlays for weapons.
										
										 
(Disclosure: Several major weapons-makers contribute to my think tank; some are consulting clients.) 
So by the time the Budget Control Act began being implemented in early 2013, Pentagon outlays for new technology were at a low ebb.&nbsp; The Air Force was flying 50-year-old bombers and tankers, the Army was relying mainly on combat systems funded in the Reagan years, and the Navy’s shipbuilding budget amounted to less than one day of federal spending at prevailing rates.&nbsp; And what did the Budget Control Act do? It cut military spending on new technology even further. To quote the Pentagon’s most recent estimate of sequestration impacts, legislatively mandated spending reductions during the balance of the decade would unfold “with one-third of the cuts being taken in Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) accounts and two-thirds in the modernization accounts.” 
O&amp;M is the main account funding readiness. Modernization encompasses research, development and procurement of military technology.&nbsp; So as I said, the problem with defense sequestration isn’t just that funding levels are well below what is needed to execute current strategy, but the way in which some key accounts are hit much harder than others — especially technology.&nbsp; Consider the Army.&nbsp; It has nearly ceased developing new combat systems, having canceled development of next-generation armored vehicles, air defenses, and reconnaissance helicopters.&nbsp; It is also curtailing outlays for a new battlefield communications network, officially its top modernization priority. 
Other services are facing similar problems.&nbsp; The Marine Corps has been forced to defer plans for a new amphibious landing craft.&nbsp; The Navy is having trouble finding money for a replacement of its Ohio-class ballistic missile subs — arguably the most important modernization initiative in the whole joint portfolio.&nbsp; The Air Force says it may have to retire its entire fleet of KC-10 tankers, at a time when the global reach afforded by aerial refueling is becoming more important.&nbsp; Meanwhile, vital investments in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets that would help U.S. warfighters to pinpoint elusive adversaries are not being made, and defense of the homeland against missile attack is getting only a few hours worth of federal funding annually. 
Not that the readiness accounts are faring much better.&nbsp; If budget caps required by the budget law are imposed in 2016 and beyond after a modest respite in 2014 and 2015, the Army will only be able to fund 65% of the heavy maintenance needs for its ground vehicles, and the Navy will only be able to cover about 70% of ship and aircraft repairs.&nbsp; So the backlog of unusable equipment will gradually build up to a point where much of the force isn’t available on short notice.&nbsp; The Air Force will see critical readiness accounts such as training ranges and military exercises significantly underfunded, grounding aircraft and pilots alike. 
Although the joint force exited Iraq in a high state of readiness and continues to acquit itself well in Afghanistan, it doesn’t take long for a military that relies on heavy training and cutting-edge technology to run down once the money is cut off.&nbsp; And that’s what the Budget Control Act does.&nbsp; At a time when defense spending represented less than a fifth of federal spending, it mandated that half of all deficit reductions come from the military budget; it then allocated cuts within the military budget in a fashion that did the greatest harm to the sinews of strength on which the joint force most depends.&nbsp; If this pattern of spending cuts persists through the end of the decade, military defeat in a future conflict is a real danger.
