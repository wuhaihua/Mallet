The best prices can sell out, so don't wait if you find a price that is cheaper than you have seen elsewhere.&quot;It's been about two years since AirTran (now part of Southwest Airlines) and United Airlines ended programs offing discount fares or special bonus travel credits for students or young travelers. But Lufthansa continues to offer its Generation Fly program for students to travel to Europe and beyond.The program promises special student fares and is open to college or university students in the United States and to people 12 to 25 years of age who have a valid college .edu or K12.[state].US email address.Several student-oriented travel companies, such as Student Universe, STA Travel, operate much like other travel booking sites but also offer some negotiated airline discounts for college students and people under age 26.&quot;Even though most airlines provide discounted pricing for students, they only do so in limited quantities,&quot; said Paul Jacobs, a Student Universe spokesman. &quot;The best prices can sell out, so don't wait if you find a price that is cheaper than you have seen elsewhere.&quot;Students traveling to and from college via bus or train can get 10 percent discounts on Amtrak fares and 20 percent off Greyhound fares with the Student Advantage Card, which costs $22.50 per year (multiyear memberships are discounted) and offers savings at stores online and on campus. The International Student Identity Card offers a 10 percent discount on the lowest Amtrak fares as well.Megabus and Bolt Bus offer discounted bus service (some tickets sell for as low as $1) for everyone to an increasing network of cities, and the route map includes many college towns. Shared-ride boards are also available at most colleges and universities.When it comes to visiting a student at college, such as during parents' weekend or a major sporting event, check the college website for hotels or inns offering discounts. And always ask if there are any school-related discounts when making reservations on your own in a college town.Less-traditional lodging options such as Airbnb and Vacation Rentals By Owner may also be an option. But Schupp advises parents not to buy any plane tickets or book hotel rooms until they've talked to their student about a visit because &quot;they get busy with their new lives on campus and may have other plans.&quot;
