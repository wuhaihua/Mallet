Mumbai: A day after budget carrier SpiceJet announced fares starting at Rs 499 across its domestic network, Jet Airways too jumped on the bandwagon rolling out Rs 500 fares for the economy class on its domestic flights for a limited period today.
The all inclusive fares of the city-headquartered Jet Airways, starts from Rs 500 excluding statutory taxes and customers will be able to enjoy these substantial discounts across all destinations on the airlines' domestic network, the airline said in a release.
The bookings under the offer, however, can be made only in two days, starting tomorrow, the airline said, adding that travel under the offer can only be taken January 16, 2015 onwards.
The offer is valid for travel only on direct flights on the airline's domestic network and does not cover group bookings, it said.
SpiceJet, which has been rolling out heavy discounts on its ticket prices, starting January this year, had yesterday claimed to have sold more one lakh ticket in a single day under its Rs 499 special fares scheme.
