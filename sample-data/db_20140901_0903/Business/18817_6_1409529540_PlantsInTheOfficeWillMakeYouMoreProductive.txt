Plants In The Office Will Make You More Productive Plants In The Office Will Make You More Productive 
Plants in the office aren&#8217;t just more attractive than staplers  &#8212; they can also improve your productivity. A study by scientists suggest that decking your desk with greenery can improve performance by as much as 15 per cent.

The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, compared large offices in the UK and the Netherlands. Parts of each office were filled with green plants, while others were stripped back. Over a two-month period, workplace productivity was monitored, and employees were surveyed to determine levels of satisfaction and perceptions of air quality. The &#8220;green&#8221; environments performed better on every measure.
Given the growth in promotion of &#8220;lean&#8221; office design, where all external decoration is stripped, it&#8217;s a useful reminder that cutting back doesn&#8217;t always make sense. To get your office greened up, check out our guide to the best indoor plants for Australian offices.
