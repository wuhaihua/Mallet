In a joint press conference, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe commented on a number of issues including strategic maritime cooperation, security cooperation and taking forward nuclear talks.
"The two prime ministers ... affirmed their shared commitment to maritime security, freedom of navigation and overflight, civil aviation safety, unimpeded lawful commerce, and the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law," the joint statement said.
In a sign of their warm ties, the two leaders greeted each other with a hug when they met on Saturday in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto for an informal dinner. Modi is one of the three people that Abe follows on Twitter, while the Indian leader admires Abe's brand of nationalist politics.
Here's a quick wrap-up on everything that happened since Modi began his five day official visit to Japan:
On Indo-Japanese relations:
The Indian Prime Minister said that better relations between the two countries would be better for the world and reiterated that the world was sure that the 20th century would belong to Asia.
"The 21st century belongs to Asia ... but how the 21st century will be depends on how strong and progressive India-Japan ties are," Modi said.
On Japanese investments in India: 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a special team in his office to fast-track investments from Japan.
"Two nominees selected by Japan will also be part of this decision-making team, which will evaluate the business proposals," he said.
On a civil nuclear deal:

The Prime Minister said he hoped that some sanctions on Indian companies would be lifted and said that the agreement on defence equipment showed that relations between the two countries had improved.
"Over nuclear co-operation there has been progress over the last several months. I was able to have discussions with PM Modi on the issue and we were able to deepen our understanding on both sides," Abe said.
