Feinstein: Obama ‘Too Cautious’ On ISIS [VIDEO] Feinstein: Obama ‘Too Cautious’ On ISIS [VIDEO] Senate Intelligence Committee chair Diane Feinstein called President Barack Obama &#8220;too cautious&#8221; in his response to the ultra-violent jihadists in ISIS, adding he was &#8220;wrong&#8221; to call them a jayvee team back in January.
The Democratic California senator appeared on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet The Press&#8221; Sunday, discussing with Andrea Mitchell a possible American response to the rapid rise of Sunni fundamentalists in Syria and Iraq. On Thursday, Obama admitted he did not yet have a plan to deal with the terrorist surge.
&#8220;They have been on the march now for months, if not years,&#8221; Mitchell noted. &#8220;So why does the president still say we don&#8217;t have a strategy yet? Doesn&#8217;t that project weakness from the White House?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I mean, I know what you want me to say, But I&#8217;m not going to say it in that sense,&#8221; Feinstein replied. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve learned one thing about this president, and that is he&#8217;s very cautious. Maybe, in this instance, too cautious.&#8221;
&#8220;I do know that the military, I know that the state department, I know that others have been putting plans together,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;And so hopefully those plans will coalesce into a strategy.&#8221;
Mitchell also brought up the president&#8217;s &#8220;jayvee&#8221; label given to ISIS. &#8220;That was clearly wrong,&#8221; she asserted.
&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s wrong, too,&#8221; Feinstein agreed. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a major varsity team, if you want to use those kind of monikers. I see nothing that compares to its viciousness . . . These are a group of people that are extraordinarily dangerous. And they&#8217;ll kill with abandon.&#8221;
