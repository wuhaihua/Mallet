Narcissists Self-Involved Enough To Recognize Their Narcissism Narcissists Self-Involved Enough To Recognize Their Narcissism Here&rsquo;s an easy way to find out if someone is a narcissist. Just ask them. That&rsquo;s according to a study in the journal PLoS One. [Sara Konrath et al.: Development and Validation of the Single Item Narcissism Scale (SINS)]

Researchers posed the following question to more than two thousand people: &ldquo;To what extent do you agree with this statement: I am a narcissist.&rdquo;&nbsp;

The researchers also provided participants with a definition of narcissist: egotistical, self-focused and vain. Not traits most people would want to be associated with &ndash; unless of course you&rsquo;re a narcissist.&nbsp;

A small percentage of the study subjects said they were. Most said they were not.&nbsp;

Then, researchers had the volunteers fill out a lengthy narcissism clinical assessment. Those who had rated themselves high on the narcissism scale also scored high on the assessment.&nbsp;

After eleven rounds of tests, the researchers concluded that when the full forty-question clinical questionnaire could not be done, the Single Item Narcissism Scale, or SINS, &ldquo;To what extent do you agree with this statement: I am a narcissist,&rdquo; was a valuable tool. &nbsp;

Seems that there isn&rsquo;t much mystery when narcissists themselves are asked to self-identify. Yes, they may be narcissists&mdash;but they aren&rsquo;t clueless.&nbsp;
