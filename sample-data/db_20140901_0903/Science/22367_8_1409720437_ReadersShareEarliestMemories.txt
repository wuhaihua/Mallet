Trying to recall the very first episodes of our lives can be surprisingly tricky. In part this is because our infancy is a period of intense learning, and the growth of new cells to support that process may disrupt our older memories. In addition, our malleable young minds can easily create false memories.
In June, Scientific American MIND asked readers to think back to the very first events that they could remember. As several surveys and studies have discovered, these memories may be dramatic but more often they are simply detailed, nostalgic recollections of perfectly ordinary events. Below we have compiled more than 100 memories submitted by readers so that you can explore their earliest episodes.
