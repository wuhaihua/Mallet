This is the second in a two-part series on nutrition and fertility. Last week, I talked about dietary factors that affect women&rsquo;s reproductive health. But, obviously, it takes two people to make a baby - and nutrition has a significant impact on men&rsquo;s reproductive function as well. This week&rsquo;s episode focuses on the things men can do to enhance their fertility.
First, I want to reiterate something I said&nbsp;last week: Most of this information is gleaned from observational and not experimental data. In other words, we&rsquo;re looking at the&nbsp;associations&nbsp;between various nutritional factors and male fertility. We don&rsquo;t know for certain that adopting these habits improves fertility. However, seeing as all of them are consistent with overall good health, there certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any harm in trying.
Two Big Factors in Male Fertility
There&rsquo;s an old saying that a gentlemen should never ask a lady about her age or her weight. If that&rsquo;s true, fertility doctors are no gentlemen! As I talked about last week, both factors play a big role in a woman&rsquo;s fertility. But guess what, guys? Both of these factors also apply to&nbsp;you.
Unlike women, who reach a hard-stop at menopause, men can continue to father children into old age. However, sperm quality&mdash;in terms of both numbers and friskiness, or motility&mdash;starts to decline around age 35. You can&rsquo;t turn back the clock, of course, but you should be aware that delaying parenthood while you pursue other goals may make it a little harder for you to start a family.
