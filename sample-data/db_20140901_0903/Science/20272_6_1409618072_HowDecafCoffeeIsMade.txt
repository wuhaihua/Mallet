How Decaf Coffee Is Made How Decaf Coffee Is Made Video: If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how it&#8217;s possible to make decaf coffee &#8212; which you can buy in whole-bean form &#8212; when the caffeine is inside the damn bean, then you&#8217;re not alone. Fortunately, there is an answer, and it&#8217;s in this video.
In the first of what promises to be a wonderful new series, Mental Floss discusses decaf. First, it&#8217;s worth noting that very little decaf coffee is truly stimulant-free: most cups will still have a few milligrams of it lurking in the cup. But in terms of getting it out? That&#8217;s a job for solvents &#8212; originally benzene and then later, more safely, carbon dioxide. If you don&#8217;t like the sound of that then, huh, why not, say, just drink a proper cup of coffee? [Mental Floss]
