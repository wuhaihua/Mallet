Scientist Are Now Using Magnets To Detect Malaria Scientist Are Now Using Magnets To Detect Malaria Malaria is a hard disease to treat &#8212; but it&#8217;s even harder to detect. A new breakthrough uses a technology similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that essentially detects parasite poop in the blood of infected patients to provide a reliable diagnosis.
The research team from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research (SMART) detects a parasitic waste product called hemozoin, reports EurekaAlert. When the parasites infect red blood cells, they feed on the nutrient-rich hemoglobin carried by the cells. As hemoglobin breaks down, it releases iron, which can be toxic, so the parasite converts the iron into hemozoin &#8212; a weakly paramagnetic crystallite. According to the report:It&#8217;s a clever little combo of physics, chemistry and biology. The current prototype of the machine that&#8217;s used too achieve this is small enough to sit on a table or a bench, but the researchers are working to get it down to the size of an iPad.The best part is that unlike the current method of testing for malaria, which involves drawing a syringe-full of blood from a patients vein, smearing it across a glass slide and staining it with a special dye to look for the malaria parasite, the SMART system requires less than 10 microlitres of blood &#8212; just a pinprick is enough.
