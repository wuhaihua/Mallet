					                           An exceptionally dry summer — and a watering hose that was too short — helped archaeologists clear up a centuries-old mystery surrounding Britain's Stonehenge monument: Did the ancient stones make a complete circle in ancient times?The dried-up grass around Stonehenge suggests that they did. A steward at the site, Tim Daw, noticed in July 2013 that there were some particularly parched spots on the monument's southwest side, spanning a gap in today's incomplete arc of stones. Archaeologists say those spots represent places where the ground was disturbed by the digging of stone holes.&quot;If these stone holes actually held upright stones, then we've got a complete circle,&quot; Susan Greaney, senior properties historian for English Heritage, said in an emailed statement. &quot;It's really significant, and it shows us just how much we still have to learn about Stonehenge.&quot;Greaney explained to the BBC that the grass at Stonehenge is watered during dry spells in the summer, &quot;but our hosepipe doesn't reach to the other side of the stone circle.&quot;&quot;If we'd had a longer hosepipe, we might not have been able to see them,&quot; she said.The phenomenon was first reported a year ago by British archaeologist Mike Pitts, and explained in detail in September's issue of the journal Antiquity.&quot;This is a wonderful piece of serendipitous research, highly productive and promptly published,&quot; Pitts says. &quot;If anyone remained unconvinced that new, targeted excavation at Stonehenge is needed, surely any doubts must now be dispelled?&quot;
