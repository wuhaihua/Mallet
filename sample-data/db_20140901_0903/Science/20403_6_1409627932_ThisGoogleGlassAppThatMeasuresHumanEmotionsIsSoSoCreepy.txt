This Google Glass App That Measures Human Emotions Is So, So Creepy This Google Glass App That Measures Human Emotions Is So, So Creepy It&#8217;s not like we need any more reminders about how creepy Google Glass can be, but developers never stop surprising us. An new app from Germany&#8217;s Fraunhofer Institute that uses facial tracking, proprietary tools and Glass, can measure human emotions. In real time.
The technology, dubbed SHORE (Sophisticated High-speed Object Recognition), gauges emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness and surprise and projects this information directly onto the screen of your Glass, right across the face of the person you&#8217;re looking at. It doesn&#8217;t just stop there. It also estimates their age and their gender, a feature, Fraunhofer says, can lead to applications in interactive gaming and market research. This is like RoboCop, but real, and on your face. Now.If there are multiple people in a frame, you will get separate emotional attributes for all of them. All processing happens directly on the Glass CPU, which means that your Glass device is probably going to last you all of 20 minutes as Geek.com points out.The researchers at Frunhaufer &#8220;trained&#8221; SHORE by exposing it to a database with more than 10,000 annotated human faces. They say that beyond the creepy factor, the app could help people with disabilities such as autism, where emotions that the wearer is unable to interpret could be superimposed on their field of vision. Which, I guess, makes it less creepy? Maybe? [GizMag via Geek.com]
