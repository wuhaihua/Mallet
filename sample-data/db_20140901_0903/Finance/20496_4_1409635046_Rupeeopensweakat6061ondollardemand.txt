The rupee opened weak by 9 paise at 60.61 per dollar against the previous close of 60.52 against the dollar on fresh dollar demand from banks and importers. 

Forex dealers said besides dollar&#8217;s gains against other currencies, increased demand for the American unit from importers had put pressure on the rupee, but a higher opening in the domestic equity market limited the losses. 

The domestic currency had lost two paise to close at 60.52 against the US currency in yesterday&#8217;s trade, following sustained dollar demand from importers amid firm cues from overseas.

The interbank call money rate, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from one another, opened higher at 7.5 per cent from the previous close of 7 per cent.
