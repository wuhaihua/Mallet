If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will  make sure customers are notified immediately."Right  now, for security reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to  speculate further. We will provide further information as soon as  possible."Krebs reported that the suspected hackers in this case could be the same as those suspected of stealing card information from Target and P.F.
