DNA of non-violence ingrained in our society: PM DNA of non-violence ingrained in our society: PM  Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sought to address the concerns of international community over India not signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) by saying that the country&#8217;s commitment to peace and non-violence is ingrained in the &#8220;DNA of Indian society&#8221; which is above any international treaty or processes.&#8220;India is a land of Lord Buddha. Buddha lived for peace and suffered for peace and that message is prevalent in India,&#8221; Modi said at Sacred Heart University here while replying to a question by a student.During an interaction, he was asked how India would enhance the trust of the international community without changing its stand on nuclear NPT, which it has refused to sign despite possessing nuclear weapons.Modi used the land of Japan, which is the only country to have been the victim of an atom bomb attack, to send out the message on this issue amid moves to have a civil nuclear deal with Tokyo. India refuses to sign the NPT because it considers it as flawed.Asserting that India&#8217;s &#8220;commitment to non-violence is total&#8221;, Modi said it is ingrained in the &#8220;DNA of Indian society and this is above any international treaty&#8221;, apparently referring to India&#8217;s refusal to sign the NPT.&#8220;In international affairs, there are some processes. But above them is the commitment of the society,&#8221; he said, underlining the need for rising &#8220;above the treaties&#8217;&#8217;.To buttress his point, the Prime Minister cited how India undertook the freedom struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi with the entire society being committed to non-violence, surprising the whole world.He went on to add that India, for thousands of years, has had the belief in &#8216;vasudhaiva kutumbakam&#8217; (the whole world is one family). &#8220;When we consider the whole world as one family, how can we even think about doing anything that would harm or hurt anyone?&#8221;
