Walgreen And Two Other Stocks To Buy And Trade Walgreen And Two Other Stocks To Buy And Trade Disclosure: I have no positions in Walgreen, Genworth Financial or KeyCorp. 
The last week of August may have had subdued trading volumes but three of the five major averages I track reached new highs. The Dow Industrial Average set an all-time intraday high at 17,153.80 on August 26 as did the S&amp;P 500 at 2,005.04. The Nasdaq continued higher setting a multiyear intraday high at 4,580.27 on August 29.
	
								 
The Dow Transportation Average lagged versus its all-time high at 8,515.04 set on July 27 with the Russell 2000 further back versus its all-time high at 1,213.55 set on July 1. This continues the pattern where the Russell 2000 peaks first at major cycle turns for the stock market. 
In this environment there was one stock I had my eye on that traded lower and tested its value level and thus became a member of my ValuTrader Model Portfolio.
								
										 
Drug store giant Walgreen traded down to a test of last week’s value level at $60.56 where I had recommended investors use good ‘til canceled limit orders to buy this stock. 
Walgreen has a buy rating according to ValuEngine.com with a one-year price target at $66.68. The stock stumbled from its 50-day simple moving average at $72.62 on August 5 all the way to a low of $57.75 on August 6, below its 200-day simple moving average at $65.28. 
Walgreen’s weekly chart became negative with its five-week modified moving average at $65.47. This week’s value level is $57.57 with its semiannual risky level at $69.02. 
Let’s take a look at two stocks from the finance sector that I like.
										
										 
Genworth Financial is an insurance company that provides life and lifestyle protection, retirement income, investment and mortgage insurance for their customers.&nbsp;ValuEngine has a strong buy rating on Genworth Financial with a one-year price target at $16.10. This week’s value level at $11.52 is the level at which to enter a good ‘til canceled limit order to buy this stock. A monthly risky level is at $16.10. 
KeyCorp is a regional bank that’s a component of the KBW banking index. The bank has a buy rating according to ValuEngine with a one-year price target at $15.14. This week’s value level at $12.66 is the level at which to enter a good ‘til canceled limit order to buy KeyCorp. A monthly pivot is $13.88 with a quarterly risky level at $15.83. 
Last week the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released its Quarterly Banking Profile for the second quarter of 2014. A key to the success of a regional bank in a struggling economy is to increase total assets. KeyCorp did that with a 1% gain sequentially to $89 billion. Keycorp is the 16th largest bank among the 24 components of the banking index. 
KeyCorp is well-managed when it comes to real estate loan exposure. Its ratio of construction and development loans to risk-based capital is just 31.2% well below the regulatory guideline of 100%. Its ratio of commercial real estate loans to risk-based capital is 105.7% also well below the regulatory guideline of 300%. The bank has a pipeline risk of 58.8% which is excellent. Pipeline risk is the ratio of real estate loans issued versus loan commitments.
