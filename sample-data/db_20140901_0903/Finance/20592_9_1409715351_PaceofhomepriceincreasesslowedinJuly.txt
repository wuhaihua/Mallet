Pace of home price increases slowed in July Pace of home price increases slowed in July WASHINGTON - U.S. home prices rose in July but at a slower rate compared with earlier this year. The moderating price increases could help support sales.Real estate data provider CoreLogic says prices rose 7.4 percent in July from July 2013. That was slightly below June's year-over-year increase of 7.5 percent.Prices rose 1.2 percent in July from June. But CoreLogic's monthly figures aren't adjusted for seasonality, such as buying that occurs in warm weather.The smaller price gains should make homes more affordable. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.1 percent last week, the lowest in a year. And the number of available homes rose 3.5 percent in July to the most in nearly two years. A greater supply tends to limit the bidding wars that inflate prices.
