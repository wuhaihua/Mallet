Top quality paper from reputed Indian companies will find takers in Switzerland, said Marco Estermann, Head, Issuer Relations, Six Swiss Exchange.&#160;&#160;The need for higher returns (given the prevailing low interest rates there) and the cap on investments by pension funds offer an opportunity for well rated&#160;Indian companies, he said.

Diversification of investor base and availing of the advantages of a strong Swiss currency are the other benefits for such companies, he said.&#160;Indian telecom major Bharti Airtel raised about 350 million Swiss francs recently on this exchange.&#160;About 280 top international companies are listed on the exchange. Based on feedback from banks and investors and their experience, Marco said Indian companies which raise a minimum of 100 million Swiss francs in debt or about 70 to 80 million Swiss francs in equity would find the fund-raising process beneficial.&#160;

The Swiss exchange is particularly strong in sectors such as speciality chemicals, financial services and life sciences, Marco said.&#160;&#160;He said the benefits of a cluster-driven approach that enabled the listing of a number of peer group companies, were improved research coverage, specialised investors, improved trading liquidity and good valuation.&#160;
