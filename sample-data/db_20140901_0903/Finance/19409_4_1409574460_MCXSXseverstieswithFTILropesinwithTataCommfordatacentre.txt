MCX-SX severs ties with FTIL, ropes in with Tata Comm for data centre MCX-SX severs ties with FTIL, ropes in with Tata Comm for data centre 
MCX Stock Exchange has shifted its data centre and co-location services to Tata Communications from Financial Technologies. The migration includes co-location, front-end and back-end information systems too.


Feed vendors, depositories, clearing banks and custodians are also connected to the new data centre. 

The connectivity testing was concluded&#160;on Sunday&#160;and the exchange has commenced live trading from the new data centre&#160;on Monday, said MCX-SX which is trying to distance itself from the scam-tainted group company Financial Technologies.


Saurabh Sarkar, Managing Director, MCX-SX said shifting the data centre to a reputed partner like Tata Communications would give the exchange much needed reduction in cost and maintaining world class service standards. The focus would now be on developing consistent and sustainable volumes, he said.


Last week, the exchange relocated corporate office to new premises at the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai from group headquarters Exchange Square and FT Tower.
