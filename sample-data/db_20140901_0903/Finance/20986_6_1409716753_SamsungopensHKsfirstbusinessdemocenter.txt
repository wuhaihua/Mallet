Samsung opens HK's first business demo center Samsung opens HK's first business demo center Samsung Electronics is taking its enterprise business in Hong Kong to the next level with the opening of its Executive Briefing Center (EBC) last Thursday. Located at Central, the EBC showcases different business applications using Samsung's display, mobile device and business software. The center is defined with six themed experience zones, aiming to demonstrate business across the hospitality, retail, restaurants, financial, education and logistics industries. Among them include applications developed by Samsung that targeted the education sector. Samsung Education Solutions (SES) and Interactive White Board (IWB) allow teachers to push content from the white board to students' tablets. Aiming to enable e-learning via tablets, the ESE also enables teachers to monitor and control students' tablets. The collaboration feature also encourages interaction between students through their tablet devices. According to Ellen Fu, head of enterprise business, a school in Hong Kong is using these applications at its classrooms. In addition to Samsung's software, the EBC also showcases applications from their partners. At the hospitality zone, OpenWays, a partner demonstrates an application that allows guest to check-in and enter their rooms via their mobile phones. Using ultrasound technologies, guest can enter their rooms simply by placing their phone over the lock. "(Consumers and) their heightened expectations are reshaping the business environment and operations," said Raymond Lee, managing director of Samsung Electronics Hong Kong. "Samsung utilizes its strongest edge to work together with different business partners across a wide spectrum of industries." Fu added the center is available for partners to demonstrate their applications upon appointment. The Hong Kong EBC is the third one in Asia, following Seoul and Shanghai.
