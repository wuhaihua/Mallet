Sensex opens marginally in the green Sensex opens marginally in the green 
The Sensex and the Nifty opened the session marginally in the green due to profit-booking by funds and retail investors amid weak Asian cues. 

At 9.15 a.m., the 30-share BSE index Sensex was trading at 26,907.91, up 40.36 points and the 50-share NSE index Nifty was trading at 8,042.15, up 14.45 points. 

Asian shares were down as a US labour market holiday on Monday kept investors subdued in Asia. 

The mood was also tempered by the persistent geopolitical concerns and weak manufacturing sureys in Asia and Europe showing pockets of weakness in the global economy. 

The euro slipped to a fresh one-year low of $1.3117 due to uncertainty over the European Central Bank's policy decision later this week. 

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.4 per cent after managing to carve out gains on Monday. 

Investors were awaiting the the ISM's report on US manufacturing due later in the day, which might point to the US phasing out quantitative easing just as the ECB contemplates its adoption.
