Market Reduces Brazil Growth Forecast After Weak 2Q Market Reduces Brazil Growth Forecast After Weak 2Q Brazil’s back-to-back economic contraction in the first and second quarters now has the nation’s top banks reducing their year-ending GDP forecast to a whopping 0.52%. This is the 14th consecutive week that economists reduced their forecasts for Brazil’s economy. 
Last week, the Central Bank’s Focus survey had GDP growth ending 2014 at 0.7%. The survey comes out every Monday.
	
								 
The decline comes on the heels of a poor showing in the second quarter. The economy contracted 0.6% from the first quarter, which had also contracted, putting Brazil in a technical recession. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, Brazil’s GDP slipped 0.9%. 
Next year, however, should be better. The Central Bank survey has 1.5% growth forecast for next year, which would be like a boom compared to this one.
								
										 
Investors have been pouring into Brazilian equities in speculation that the new president of the country will change economic policies and be more serious about inflation. Brazilians vote in October.

 If the market is right, and the new president does move away from the current model of haphazard macro-prudential measures designed to curb consumption in some sectors, rev it up in others, and leave interest rates artificially low, then Brazilian equities may have further to go.
										
										 
 The market right now is second only to India, a long term favorite, as investors bet for a change of course. 
 “The valuations from the bottom-up look very good,” says Marc Tommasi, head of global investment strategy at Manning &amp; Napier, a Rochester, NY based investment firm. 
 Brazil’s 12 month inflation is around 6.5%, over 100 basis points over the Central Bank’s target. The administration of Dilma Rousseff has been more keen on fighting inflation by other measures rather than monetary policy. Investors have grown more accustomed to the inflation targeting of Central Banker Henrique Meirelles under the government of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Interest rates were often high, but inflation remained stable and nearly always on target. 
 “We think there is a 60% chance of a change of government come October,” said analyst from BBT, a S&atilde;o Paulo investment firm. “That should help maintain current levels in the stock market,” the note from BBT said.
