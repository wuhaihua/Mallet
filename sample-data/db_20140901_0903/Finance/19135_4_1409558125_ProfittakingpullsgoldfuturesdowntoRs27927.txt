Gold prices fell 0.25 per cent to Rs 27,927 per 10 grams at the futures trade today as speculators booked profits even as the metal strengthened overseas.


On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in October fell Rs 69 or 0.25 per cent to Rs 27,927 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 142 lots.


Likewise, the metal for delivery in far-month December shed Rs 51 or 0.18 per cent to Rs 28,090 per 10 grams in two lots.


Analysts said profit-booking by speculators mainly weighed on gold prices at the futures trade but a better trend in the overseas market, capped the losses.


Globally, gold traded a shade higher at $1,287.43 an ounce Singapore today from $1,287.32 on August 29.
