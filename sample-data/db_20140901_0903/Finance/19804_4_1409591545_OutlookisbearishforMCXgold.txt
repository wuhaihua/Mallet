The corrective rally witnessed in the gold futures contract traded on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) seems to be losing momentum. The contract which is currently trading near &#8377;27,950 for 10 gm has given back some of its gain after recording a high of &#8377;28,178 on Thursday. The rally in the global gold spot price which seemed to be on course to breach the psychological $1,300 per ounce level last week halted and reversed after the strong US GDP data release. The MCX-gold also took cues from the global price and has turned lower now.Technically, the 21-day moving average at &#8377;28,200 has held well and is maintaining the pressure on the contract. Immediate support is at &#8377;27,875 &#8211; the 55-day moving average and the significant support is at &#8377;27,700. A daily close below &#8377;27,875 will increase the probability of a fall below &#8377;27,700. A break below &#8377;27,700 can drag the contract lower to &#8377;27,435 &#8211; the 200-week moving average support level. Traders who have taken short position at &#8377;28,000 last week can hold the position with the same stop-loss at &#8377;28,250 for the target of &#8377;27,500.The 21-day moving average at &#8377;28,200 is a key resistance level for the contract. The outlook will turn bullish only if the contract records a strong close above this level. Such a break can take the MCX-gold futures contract higher to &#8377;28,500.(Note: The recommendations are based on technical analysis. There is a risk of loss in trading.)
