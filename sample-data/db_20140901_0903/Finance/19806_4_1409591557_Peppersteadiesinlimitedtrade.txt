Pepper steadies in limited trade Pepper steadies in limited trade 

Spot pepper prices stayed steady on limited activities. No trading activities were reported from the futures platforms. Sellers appear to have gone on a wait-and-watch mode and hence the arrivals were very limited. Availability of imported material in the upcountry markets slowed down demand. Meanwhile, a Kochi-based inter-State dealer has imported 36 tonnes of pepper from Sri Lanka via Mumbai port. It has not influenced the spot market here, market sources told Business Line. They said inter-State dealers from Tamil Nadu were buying directly from Wayanad. The Kerala High Court has ordered release of 6,000 tonnes of pepper held in the warehouses of NCDEX after processing and testing. Details of the judgement are awaited, they said.
