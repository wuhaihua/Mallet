Indian power station coal shortage worsens Indian power station coal shortage worsens 
The number of Indian thermal power plants with less than seven days of coal stocks has risen to 56 this week from 52 last week, government data showed on Wednesday.


India's 100 thermal power plants had enough coal overall to last six days on Sept. 1, unchanged on week, the Central Electricity Authority said.


The stock levels are the lowest since mid-2012, when hundreds of millions of people were cut off in one of the world's worst blackouts.
