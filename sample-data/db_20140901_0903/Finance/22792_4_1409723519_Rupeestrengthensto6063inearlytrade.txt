The rupee opened strong by 6 paise at 60.63 per dollar against the previous close of 60.69 in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market today due to sustained overseas capital inflows.


Fresh selling of the American currency by exporters amid sustained inflow of foreign funds supported the rupee, forex dealers said.


Besides, a higher opening in the domestic equity market also helped the rupee but the dollar&#8217;s gain against other currencies overseas, capped the rise, they added.


The Sensex and the Nifty rose nearly 0.4 per cent in the opening session on Wednesday on sustained buying by funds and retail investors amid firm global cues.


At 9.15 a.m., the 30-share BSE index Sensex was up 100.55 points at 27,119.94 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty was up 31 points at 8,114.05.


Dealers said the rupee may move with a downward bias in the short-term even as the central bank will continue to intervene to avoid sharp volatility in the Indian currency.
