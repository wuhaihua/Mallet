Drake's Instagram is Serious, Sexy, and Smokey (Pun Intended... Drake's Instagram is Serious, Sexy, and Smokey (Pun Intended... So we checked out Drake&#8217;s Instagram this weekend and afterwards&#8230;nothing was the same. (
Seriously guys. He may have started from the bottom, but now his Insta-game is HERE. And you can bet that it is not going away anytime soon.
Okay, okay &#8211; all jokes aside, he really is at the top of the list when it comes to hot celebrity Instagrams and the best part is that he doesn&#8217;t even try to pretend he&#8217;s not hot. He knows it and he knows that we know it and he knows what we want.Â 
Which is serious, smoldering pics of him looking like a badass on the stage, or straight chillin&#8217; on a couch with some artfully placed Siracha, or getting a casual lap dance from that girl with the most famous booty in Hollyhood (what up, Nicki Minaj).
Not to mention he has quite an abundance of &#8220;smokey&#8221; picture as well. From preforming with fog machines, to passing a lit blunt back and forth with his buddy, Drake really is burning up the insta-world.
Oh who are we kidding, he&#8217;s burning up the real world too.
 and let us know which one&#8217;s are your favorites in the comments below!
