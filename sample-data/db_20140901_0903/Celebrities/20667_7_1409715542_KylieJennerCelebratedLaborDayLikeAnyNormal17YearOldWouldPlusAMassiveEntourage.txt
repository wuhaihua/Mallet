Now THIS is how you celebrate Labor Day &#8212; with good company and a bunch of fun carnival rides!
Kylie Jenner and a group of her friends celebrated the holiday at the Malibu Chili Cook-Off on Monday!
The young bunch did normal things teenagers do. They took a number of selfies, rode a ton of rides, took selfies WHILE riding rides, and won fish at a game stand! 
Kylie and her krew certainly looked like they had a fabulous time!
If you ask us, that sounds like a pretty successful Labor Day!
