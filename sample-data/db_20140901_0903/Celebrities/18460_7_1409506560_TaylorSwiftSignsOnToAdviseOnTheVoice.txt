Taylor Swift Signs On To Advise On The Voice! Taylor Swift Signs On To Advise On The Voice! 
So much star power next season!!!
Season seven of The Voice is almost here, and we have a new person who's joining the crew: Taylor Swift!
The 24-year-old country cutie is going to advise coaches Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, and Pharrell in the same way that Coldplay’s Chris Martin did. 
Besides, each coach has their own fab advisors, with Stevie Wonder pairing up with Adam, Gavin Rossdale is Gwen’s choice, Little Big Town is working with Blake, and Alicia Keys is Pharrell’s advisor!
And then add Swifty on top of that! We told you there was a lot of star power!
We can’t wait for the season to start on September 22nd!
