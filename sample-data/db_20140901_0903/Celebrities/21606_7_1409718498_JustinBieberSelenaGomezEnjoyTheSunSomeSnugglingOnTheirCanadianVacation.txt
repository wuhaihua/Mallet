The couple that plays together, stays together for another week! 
Justin Bieber whisked Selena Gomez away on a romantic vacay in Canada this week, and they stayed busy the entire time, but not in the bedroom!
The famous duo were spotted riding ATVs, galloping on horses, hanging out around town, and The Biebs even squeezed in some golf practice with his dad and brother! 
So it was very much a family vacay for the lovebirds.
Hmmmâ€¦ That must mean things are heating up fast, right?! Should we be expecting to see them together on a red carpet again soon? 
Ch-ch-check out more photos from their romantic getaway (above)!
