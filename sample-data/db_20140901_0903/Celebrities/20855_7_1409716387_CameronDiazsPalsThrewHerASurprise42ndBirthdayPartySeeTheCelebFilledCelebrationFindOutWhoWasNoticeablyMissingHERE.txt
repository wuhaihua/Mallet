What a way to ring in a birthday!!
Cameron Diaz was surprised by a gaggle of her famous friends on Saturday, at what looked to be the most fun gathering EVER.
The Other Woman actress was joined by Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin, Drew Barrymore, Rashida Jones and Lake Bell to ring in her 42nd year&#8230;
With Cam's makeup artist gal pal Gucci Westman tweeting:
Best surprise #birthday For @camerondiaz ‼️‼️ drewbarrymore http://t.co/gOyouWZkSg


Gucci also posted some Instagram pics (as indicated by the Twitter share) but somehow deleted them from her account after the weekend!
Luckily, we snagged a few snaps (above) before they went missing, and the party looked to be an amazing time!
We did, however, notice one oddity&#8230; 
Cameron's boyfraaand Benji Madden was noticeably missing from the photos &#8212; which leads us to believe the two may have called it quits!
No confirmation for sure, but a breakup could explain why she needed a huge party to cheer up!
Thoughts???
