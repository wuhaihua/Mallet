Listen To This: Down On Your Knees! Listen To This: Down On Your Knees! 

The fact that Charli XCX and Lorde have found mainstream success gives us hope that other pop girls operating to the left-of-center can make it big too!
Girls like Banks, who consistently release great song after great song, slowly building a passionate following, and go from strength to strength. 
If you dig either of the two girls above or Lykke Li, then you will really love Banks's latest single, Begging For Thread. 
This may be her best song yet!!!
Alternapop greatness!!!
