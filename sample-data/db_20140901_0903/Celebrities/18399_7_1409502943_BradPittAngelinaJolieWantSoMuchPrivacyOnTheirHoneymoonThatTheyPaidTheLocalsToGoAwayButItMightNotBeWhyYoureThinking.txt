Good thing they saved all of that money on the wedding!
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are using their honeymoon as a chance to film their long awaited movie together, By The Sea.
The bride was spotted scouting filming locations near Malta recently, but they are going the extra mile for this flick!
Brangelina, and their brood, reportedly paid up to $200,000 to locals and business owners in Gozo, which is an island near Malta, to go away during their two months of filming!
A source revealed:

We knew they were on a working vacation, but we didn’t realize there would be THIS much work involved!
The family is going to live on a 100 foot yacht starting in September, so that they can have their privacy, but still explore the surrounding areas. 
Sounds like a ton of fun! And we love that they got the whole family involved in the filming!
