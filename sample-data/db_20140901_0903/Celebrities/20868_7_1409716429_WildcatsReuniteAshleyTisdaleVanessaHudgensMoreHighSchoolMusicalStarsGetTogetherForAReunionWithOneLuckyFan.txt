High School Musical, who says we have to let it go? It's the reunion we've all been waiting for!
The only person missing from this momentous High School Musical reunion is Zac Efron!
Oh, and Lucas Grabeel, too! LOLz!
Ashley Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens, Monique Coleman, Kenny Ortega, and Corbin Bleu all gathered for a mini reunion dinner on Friday evening &#8212; all for one lucky fan!
Remember when an exclusive reunion was promised as a prize for helping Monique with her nonprofit foundation, GimmeMo'? Well, Camilla Simon, was the lucky winner of that contest!
The old group of friends dined with their special guest of the night! We can't imagine what kind of on-set stories were exchanged during the evening!
What a night to remember for the lucky gal! ;)
