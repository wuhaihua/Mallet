Viggo Mortensen Went Blond Viggo Mortensen Went Blond 
				
								
				
Here&#8217;s Viggo Mortensen with a whole lot of Clairol Natural Instincts (shade: Sahara Light Blonde) in his hair at the photo call and premiere of Loin des Hommes at the Venice Film Festival over the weekend. Either Viggo decided to bleach himself down to his Danish roots or he threw some blonde (with chunky sun-kissed caramel low lights, very 2001) on his hair for a movie role. If the latter is the case, then I&#8217;m guessing that Viggo is starring in a brand new Harry Potter movie where he plays Voldemort whom we find out faked his death and snuck off to Hawaii to live out his dream of being Laird Hamilton&#8217;s surfing protégée.
Even though Viggo looks like he scalped David Spade and sewed that shit onto his head, I still would, because his ass cheeks are what got me through A Perfect Murder. I&#8217;d definitely let blond Viggo hommes dez loins (I don&#8217;t know what that meant, but just go with it).
