Holy Jeez Look At Colin Kaepernick's Abs On The Cover Of Sports Illustrated! Boioioioioing!! Holy Jeez Look At Colin Kaepernick's Abs On The Cover Of Sports Illustrated! Boioioioioing!! 
You may know Colin Kaepernick as the QB for the San Francisco 49er's.
Or perhaps as the tatted up, ripped to shreds, jacked as F*CK pile of hotness on the cover of Sports Illustrated's most boner inducing cover. (Are they not wearing cups?? Ow ow!)
Or maybe it's as the smoking hot grand wizard boner lord in the realm of our dreams. 
Either way, Colin Kaepernick is on the cover of Sports Illustrated, with his shirt mostly off, his dong possibly showing, and his abs so ripped he could grate cheese just by flexing at it from across the room! LOLz!
Anywayz&#8230; we just thought U might like to know that this wonderful pic (above) exists.
Enjoy!!
