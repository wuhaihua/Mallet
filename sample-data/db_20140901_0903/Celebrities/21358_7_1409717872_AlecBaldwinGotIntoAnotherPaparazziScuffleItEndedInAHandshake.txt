Alec Baldwin Got Into Another Paparazzi Scuffle & It Ended In A Handshake! Alec Baldwin Got Into Another Paparazzi Scuffle & It Ended In A Handshake! 
It’s your classic ‘he said, he said.”
Alec Baldwin has made it very clear that he’s NOT cool with the paparazzi following him around, especially when he’s with his family.
Well, on Sunday, the actor allegedly got photog, Matt Agudo, in a headlock!
What provoked him? 
According to one report, Alec, his wife Hilaria Baldwin, and their baby Carmen were playing at a park in the Hamptons when Matt approached them. Matt has a history with Alec and allegedly called Hilaria some super AWFUL names in the past!
Because of that, Mr. Baldwin ended up getting Matt in a headlock, and a nearby policeman called for backup!
Matt’s side of the story is that Hilaria started screaming when she saw him (Duh! If he called her names why wouldn't she?!) and that’s when the brouhaha started. But the pap decided not to press charges, and it all ended in a nice handshake.
So, why didn’t Matt want Alec to pay for putting him in a headlock? He explained:

Jail could have been in the cards since Alec is still dealing with legal issues from when he rode his bike the opposite direction on Fifth Avenue earlier this year.
The good news is that everything ended amicably, and both men got to spend the holiday with their families!
