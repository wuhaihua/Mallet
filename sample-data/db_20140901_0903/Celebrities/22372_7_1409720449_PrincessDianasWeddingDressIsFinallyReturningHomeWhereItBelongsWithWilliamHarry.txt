Princess Diana's Wedding Dress Is Finally Returning Home Where It Belongs — With William & Harry Princess Diana's Wedding Dress Is Finally Returning Home Where It Belongs — With William & Harry 
Princess Diana's iconic wedding dress is returning home to London!
The dress has been on display as part of the Princess's exhibit at her family's ancestral home in Althorp since 1998, but now, as her will stipulated, the wedding dress and many of her other personal belongings will be handed over to her sons, Princes William and Harry.
The will stated that the Princess' personal items be given to her sons once they both turned 30, which will happen in less than two weeks on Harry's thirtieth birthday on September 15!
The closing of the Diana: A Celebration exhibit at Althorp and the relocation of the dress to London has prompted speculation that the items will now be put on display at Kensington Palace, but nothing has been confirmed as of yet. 
We wouldn't blame the princess one bit if they wanted to keep all of their mother's private items to themselves, but knowing how generous they are, we have a feeling they will eventually want to share them with the public as well!
