Two Master Stunt Queens Attempted To Put On A Convincing Show At The “Made In America” Festival This Weekend Two Master Stunt Queens Attempted To Put On A Convincing Show At The “Made In America” Festival This Weekend 
				
								
				Okay, this is starting to get goddamn ridiculous. Even though I know and you know and your dog knows that the current state of Beyoncé and Jay-Z&#8217;s relationship is hovering somewhere around the attic of a haunted house (ie: it&#8217;s been dead for so long, it&#8217;s now officially a ghost), they&#8217;re still hustling this tired come-to-life Heart Family bullshit like we&#8217;re all a bunch of gullible rubes. Except nobody&#8217;s buying what they&#8217;re selling! It&#8217;s gotten to the point where I&#8217;m pretty sure that even members of the Beygency are like &#8220;Girl, stop.&#8221;
And yet, these two continue to pull out their stale loaf of love bread and make stunt queen sandwiches for the never-ending publicity pic-a-nic that is their lives. Yawnce and Joe Camel decided to follow up their display of affection at the VMAs last weekend (for real, what in camel hell was that) by snuggling on each other at the &#8220;Made in America&#8221; festival in Los Angeles on Sunday night, and it was..something. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t nearly as tacky and blatant as their PDA performance at the VMAs, but it was still pretty awkward.
I know a couple of people who are deeply in love (myself and Doritos don&#8217;t count), and it would be really weird to see them pulling the kind of stiff Sears Portrait Studio poses that Bey and Jay were working on Sunday night. Did they take classes from the Lance Bass Modeling School? They&#8217;re SO awkward! They look like a stock image from a Christian sex toy website, but not one of the freaky horn-horn-for-Jesus ones (they exist, trust me), the other kind &#8211; the boring ones that refer to dildos as &#8220;marital aids.&#8221; I&#8217;m so surfbored.
But the thing that&#8217;s bothering me most of all is that everything is so damn red! Was the &#8220;Made in America&#8221; festival held in a high school dark room?
