Celebrate high times - come on! 
Rihanna has been chillin' on a well deserved vacation recently, and apparently she hasn't just been getting her tan on!
The music superstar was the focus of some recently released Instagram videos that featured the Barbados beauty dancing with her friends in a bikini on a yacht smoking what-we-believe-to-be marijuana! 
Rihanna has never been shy about her weed usage, but it's still pretty shocking to see her getting high in such an open manner. 
Then again - she didn't release the videos on her own Instagram. That honor actually belongs to Instagram user mdollas11 who shared all of the footage on Sunday. 
We're guessing Rihanna is enjoying her Labor Day weekend if these videos are any indication! 
In fact - she's having a ganja old time, ha! 
Watch Rihanna getting her party on down (below) !!!
