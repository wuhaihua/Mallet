Heidi Klum & Vito Schnabel Are A Perfect Match As They Practice Some Serious PDA At The US Open! Heidi Klum & Vito Schnabel Are A Perfect Match As They Practice Some Serious PDA At The US Open! 
Game. Set. Match made in heaven.
Heidi Klum served up a kiss onto Vito Schnabel as the two watched the US Open in Flushing, Queens, yesterday!
The pair, whom are no strangers to public displays of affection, were caught kissing while watching day eight of the tennis tournament.
The 41-year-old model/television host and 28-year-old art dealer watched favorite Victoria Azarenka beat Aleksandra Krunic in two out of three sets yesterday in the tournament's fourth round, but were more interested in each other than the game at hand.
And Heidi and Vito weren't the only celebs spotted at the New York-based tourney on Labor Day!

Mary-Kate Olsen and her fianc√© Olivier Sarkozy were spotted watching with the couple, while Taye Diggs and his girlfriend Amanza Smith Brown watched a few rows down.
We're very happy for Heidi that she's found someone she's so comfortable with!
Even if she is a few years his senior.
