LeAnn Rimes, Jason Derulo, & MORE Celebs Help Raise Nearly $57 Million For Muscular Dystrophy Telethon! LeAnn Rimes, Jason Derulo, & MORE Celebs Help Raise Nearly $57 Million For Muscular Dystrophy Telethon! 
It looks like dumping a bucket of ice water on your head isn't the only way to raise money for an excellent cause!
A good ole' fashioned telethon will do the trick!
The proof is in the pudding, as the Muscular Dystrophy Association ran their 2-hour annual MDA Show of Strength telethon this weekend, featuring stars like LeAnn Rimes, Jason Derulo, and Rascal Flatts!
So how much did they raise, exactly? How about $56,952,177!! Not bad!!
However, the huge chunk of cash failed to meet last year's grand total of nearly $59 million! Oh well! $57 million is definitely nothing to be disappointed in!!
Good work, y'all!
