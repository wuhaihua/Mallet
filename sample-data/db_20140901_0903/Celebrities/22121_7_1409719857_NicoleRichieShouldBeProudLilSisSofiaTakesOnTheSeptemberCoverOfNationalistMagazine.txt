Nicole Richie Should Be Proud! Lil' Sis Sofia Takes On The September Cover Of Nationalist Magazine! Nicole Richie Should Be Proud! Lil' Sis Sofia Takes On The September Cover Of Nationalist Magazine! 
Nicole Richie’s younger sis Sofia is ready for the spotlight!
Not only does she make appearances on Candidly Nicole, but she’s also scored the September cover of Nationalist magazine!
Perfectly epitomizing school girl style, the 16-year-old rocked a cropped red sweater with a checkered mini skirt for the front page, but inside the mag, Sofia’s personal style is captured with more mature looks styled by Jazmin Whitley.
Inspired by the Olsen Twins and even her own sister, it only makes sense!
The rising model describes her own sense of style as a "mix of edgy and chic", which we get a glimpse at with some of the shots in the editorial.
We especially love her in the chic For Love &#038; Lemons coat and sweater dress!
Catch out the whole spread in the gallery (above)!!
P.S. Wanna know where to get her style? She says her favorite places to shop in Los Angeles are Barneys and Curve!
