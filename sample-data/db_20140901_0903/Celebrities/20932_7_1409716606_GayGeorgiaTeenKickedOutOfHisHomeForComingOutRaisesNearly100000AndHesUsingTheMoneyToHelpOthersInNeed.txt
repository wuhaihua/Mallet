Well it looks like this sad story is getting a very happy ending after all!
Last week, millions of viewers watched in horror as Kennesaw, Georgia, native Daniel Pierce captured the moment he was disowned, abused, and kicked out of his home by his family after he came out of the closet.
Fortunately, the 20-year-old's boyfriend David set up an account on GoFundMe to help him raise some money to start a new life, and in just 24 hours he raised an astounding $48,808!
Well the generosity has NOT stopped, as Daniel has now raised $93,765! That's not bad considering the original goal was simply $2,000 to help him get on his feet!! 
With the huge influx of cash, Daniel is making sure to give back and is donating the funds to the Lost-N-Found charity, and he says he hopes his donations and experiences will help others in a similar situation to his:

We can't even begin to speak to Daniel's strength and bravery to post that video in the first place, and it's great to see that he's using his experiences to help others in need!
Stay strong, Daniel!
