Gisele Bundchen And Tom Brady Look Better Than Perfect On A Sunset Bike Ride! Gisele Bundchen And Tom Brady Look Better Than Perfect On A Sunset Bike Ride! 
How can one couple be so cute AND fit at the same time?!
Over the weekend, Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady were spotted in Boston getting their cycle on.
The couple looked absolutely adorable as they casually pedaled around the scenic city and took in the summer sights. 
By the looks of Gisele's long and lean legs and Tom's muscular calves, it's clear these two have an affinity for exercise!!
Hopefully Tom will still make time for bike riding once the Patriot's 2014 season kicks off on September 7th!
