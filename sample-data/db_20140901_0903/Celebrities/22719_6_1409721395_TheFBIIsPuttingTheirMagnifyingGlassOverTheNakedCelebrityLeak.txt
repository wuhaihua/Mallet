TMZ says that the FBI has opened up an investigation and working on tracking down the hacker or hackers who leaked the hundreds of naked celebrity pictures that took over the Internet&#8217;s Labor Day and are the sole reasons for why thousands of mothers are cleaning their teenage son&#8217;s bedrooms today and shaking their heads over all the &#8220;cream of mushroom stains&#8221; on the carpet. The FBI didn&#8217;t get into details, but they did tell TMZ that they&#8217;re working on it and I&#8217;m taking that to mean that they&#8217;ve put Special Agent Courtney Love and Detective La Toya on the case.
&#8220;The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.&#8221;
If the hacker is American, they&#8217;re probably thinking about fleeing to Edward Snowden&#8217;s pied-à-terre in Moscow, because ScarJo&#8217;s hacker got a decade in the clink.
Reddit thinks they found the dude responsible for releasing the flood of celebrity nipples to the masses, but he told Buzzfeed that he&#8217;s innocent and a stupid plan to use the pictures to get bitcoins backfired on his ass.
It was reported that a crack in THE CLOUD might&#8217;ve made it easy for the hackers to get in and snatch up all those pictures, but Apple said today that after spending 40 hours investigating this shit, they determined that they&#8217;re not to blame (of course) and there was no breach in their security system.
&#8220;After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet&#8221;
STILL!
I knew this before, but now I really know that anything I throw up into THE CLOUD can be potentially exposed. Nearly all of my iTunes playlists are on THE CLOUD and all of my iTunes playlists are a trillion times more embarrassing than a picture of a Downton Abbey actress getting poked in the eye with a hard peen. I may or may not have that annoying ass &#8220;All About That Bass&#8221; song on one of my playlists and that song may or may not have been played at least 90 times. SANTO DIOS! Shoot down THE CLOUD now!
