Victoria Beckham Puts Her Killer Legs On Display At JFK! Victoria Beckham Puts Her Killer Legs On Display At JFK! 
Too fabulous to handle!
After a brief detour in t-shirt-and-jeans land, Victoria Beckham was back on the posh track at JFK Airport yesterday.
The designer was expertly put-together in a black wrap dress worn with black pumps and a gorgeous statement tote with an abstract blue and red design on the front.
It's only $1,950 on her website if you wanna get one of your own! Ha!
All jokes aside, we love seeing Victoria in one of her signature classy and chic outfits, ut that doesn't mean we're against seeing her in jeans, either! 
She looks good in everything!
