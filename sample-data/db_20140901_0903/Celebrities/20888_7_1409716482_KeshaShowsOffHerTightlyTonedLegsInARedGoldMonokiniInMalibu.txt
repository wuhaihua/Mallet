Look at them legs!
Kesha sure does know how to work a monokini, because that body be bangin'!
With her hair constantly changing as of late, it was sometimes hard to tell that Kesha was getting into tip-top shape.
Until now, that is! 
The Rising Star judge hit Malibu with a few friends on Friday while rocking a red one-piece with a gorgeous gold print.
Aside from her whole body looking fine, Kesha's legs looked especially toned.
Seriously. She might be sporting the best stems in Hollywood at the moment!
Keep doin' what you're doin', Kesh!
