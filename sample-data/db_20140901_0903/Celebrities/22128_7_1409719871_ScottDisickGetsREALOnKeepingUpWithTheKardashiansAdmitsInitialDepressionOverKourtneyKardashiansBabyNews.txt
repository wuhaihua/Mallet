After Scott Disick's tough year, we're not surprised to hear this news!
On last night's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Scott reacted very poorly when Kourtney Kardashian revealed she was pregnant with baby numero 3.

Overwhelmed with the prospect of more responsibility, Scott disappeared with friends for an entire night without getting in touch with his baby mama ONCE.
Thankfully LD realized his wrongdoing and explained his bad behavior with some real talk.
Scott divulged:

Thankfully Scott ultimately adjusted to the idea of another baby and by the end of the episode, Scott conceded:

Don't worry, Scott! After already raising 2 kids, number 3 should be a breeze!
