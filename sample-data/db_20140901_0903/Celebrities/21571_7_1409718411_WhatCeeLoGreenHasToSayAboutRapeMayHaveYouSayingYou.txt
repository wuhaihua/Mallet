What CeeLo Green Has To Say About Rape May Have You Saying $&%# You! What CeeLo Green Has To Say About Rape May Have You Saying $&%# You! 
CeeLo Green may have been cleared of sexual assault charges in court, but not so much in the court of public opinion.
After being accused of drugging a woman's drink with Ecstasy, the former The Voice plead guilty to only a charge of felony drug possession.
But when fans accused him of getting away with rape on Twitter, he tried to defend himself.
And that's when he made some pretty awful statements. In the ensuing back-and-forth he tweeted:

and

Ugh. CeeLo's legal argument was that he had consensual sex, but after these comments his entire concept of consent seems a little shady.
Later it seems CeeLo understood the ramifications of his comments, because he apologized, tweeting:
"Let me 1st praise god for exoneration fairness &#038; freedom! Secondly I sincerely apologize for my comments being taken so far out of context.
I only intended on a healthy exchange to help heal those who love me from the pain I had already caused from this. Please forgive me as it&#8230;

He also deleted the offending tweets, but we guess that wasn't enough. Because then he deleted his ENTIRE account.
Maybe he realized just how horrible what he said was? Or how incriminating it sounded&#8230;
