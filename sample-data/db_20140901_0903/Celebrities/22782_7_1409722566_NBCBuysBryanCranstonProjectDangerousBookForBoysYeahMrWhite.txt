Just because this news is just breaking now, doesn't mean it's bad! In fact, it's AH-Mazing!
Emmy-award winning Bryan Cranston just got some more golden news!
The project he's been attached to produce, The Dangerous Book For Boys, was just bought by NBC! Bryan is the one who knocks it out of the park!
Bryan's production company Moon Shot Entertainment just made the first-look deal with the peacock network. He is the danger!
The sing-camera comedy, based on the guidebook of the same title, is about a triage of teenage boys who are given a father's guide to living life the fullest after he dies.
Congrats Bryan! We can't wait to see this show when it comes out! We'll definitely be in a fugue state until then.
