Literally every American is screaming &#8220;QUICK! CLOSE THE BORDER!&#8221; at this very moment. And I&#8217;m eye-shanking all of you, because it looks like that little shithead is our problem once again. According to CBC News, Canada&#8217;s crown prince of shitty spoiled asshole behavior Justin Bieber has once again proved what a shitty spoiled asshole he is by crashing his ATV into a minivan and then picking a fight with the driver on Friday just east of Statford, Ontario. Caillou&#8217;s rotten cousin was taken in by police and charged with assault and dangerous driving, but he was released on the promise that he appear in a Stratford court on September 29th. How Canadian, right? &#8220;We&#8217;ll let you go if you pinky-swear to come back.&#8221;
Bieber is currently on probation for egging his neighbor&#8217;s house, so he could be majorly fucked. But speaking as a Canadian person with a basic understanding of the legal system (thanks to reruns of Street Legal), that lil&#8217; asshole will probably get off with barely a slap on the wrist. He&#8217;ll be sentenced to a 12-pack of maple-dip donuts and asked to be more careful next time before the judge musses up his hair and tells him: &#8220;Get on now, scoot! And stay outta trouble you little scamp!&#8221; Then Stratford will declare September 29th Justin Bieber Assault Day and everyone will get the day off work. No, that won&#8217;t happen &#8211; I&#8217;m sure the people of Stratford hate him just as much as the rest of North America. But they do have this weird sort of pride for him, so who knows?
But getting arrested in rural Ontario after crashing your ATV into a minivan and instigating a fist-fight with the driver? Even Ricky from Trailer Park Boys is like &#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s trashy.&#8221;
