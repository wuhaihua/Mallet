Miley Cyrus Admits She Still Loves Liam Hemsworth! Miley Cyrus Admits She Still Loves Liam Hemsworth! 
How could you not love that hunk of a man?!
Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth split up a year ago, after being engaged, but neither has had a serious significant other since!
And now we know why!
Miz Cyrus recently told Australia's Sunday Night television show that there’s still tons of love between the two! She said:

Aww! That’s actually really sweet! We’d hope that in any breakup both sides are able to remain friends. Life is just so much easier that way!
And Mileybird gave a little more insight when she was asked if Wrecking Ball is in fact about Liam, to which she said:

Well, it’s not a NO! 
No split is easy; we’re just glad to see that Miley is taking it all in stride!
