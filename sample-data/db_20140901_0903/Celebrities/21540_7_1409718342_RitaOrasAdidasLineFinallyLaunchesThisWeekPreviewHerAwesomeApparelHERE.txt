Rita Ora's Adidas Line Finally Launches This Week! Preview Her Awesome Apparel HERE! Rita Ora's Adidas Line Finally Launches This Week! Preview Her Awesome Apparel HERE! 
Last year, Rita Ora inked a $2.4 MILLION contract to design for Adidas! 
And a little less than a year later, the athletic apparel brand is FINALLY ready to sell the singer's loud and proud goodies. Her fabby line launches this Thursday!!
So what exactly came out of this multimillion-dollar deal? 
Rita designed five different "packs" of clothing within her collection, with each pack representing a different style. The packs consist of: the pastel pack, the colourblock pack (spelled the British way, of course), the black pack, the spray pack, and the roses pack. 
Which basically means five lines in one! 
Adidas has been slowly but surely releasing previews of the different packs on their website, and so far they've released three of the five. Plus, Beyonc√© has given fans a glimpse of the roses pack on her Instagram! 
Check out the different styles (above), and visit the Adidas website HERE for further updates!
