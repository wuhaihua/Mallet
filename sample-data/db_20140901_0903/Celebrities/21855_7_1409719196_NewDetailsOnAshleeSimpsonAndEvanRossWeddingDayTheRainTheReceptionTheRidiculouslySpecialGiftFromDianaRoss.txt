Rain or shine! 
Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross got hitched this weekend and the Connecticut affair was GORgeous! 
The sweet hipster couple got hitched on mommy Diana Ross' east coast estate on Monday and rumor has it, the drizzle made the bohemian theme that much more magical.
An insider revealed: 

Ashlee ditched the idea of a traditional dress and opted for a crop top and skirt along with a touch of dazzle by Neil Lane.
The most adorable part was surely when the bride's toddler, Bronx, walked her down the aisle and gave her away! AWWWWwwww!
Wait, there is more: Jessica Simpson was matron of honor while kiddies, Ace and Maxwell, were ring bearer and flower girl. 
As for the musical moments? A choir serenaded the couple after they officially became hubby and wifey with Ain't No Mountain High Enough  and Diana belted Endless Love.
The couple and guests stuffed up with a comfort food-style buffet and THEN continued eating the next day with a family BBQ at Mama Diana's.
Sounds absolutely enchanting, but where are the wedding photos??! WE MUST SEE.
