As they say, it's not a vacation without an arrest!
What? They don't say that??
Well, then someone better tell Justin Bieber because boy spent his Labor Day weekend getting arrested!
While he was vacationing in Canada with Selena Gomez, Justin ended up arrested and is now facing charges of assault and dangerous driving after being involved in an accident with a minivan while he was on an ATV.
The accident in southwestern Ontario occurred on Friday afternoon - so just after JB arrived in Canada with Selena?!
As far as why the Biebs is facing all these charges, officials said: 

He has since been released - obvi, we saw him playing with Selena this weekend - and will appear in a Stratford court on September 29th.
Now the only question that remains is what does this mean with his probation situation??
