Someone get this man a pair of steak knives because he deserves at LEAST second place for this latest video!
Alec Baldwin recently participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge with his actor friend Gregg Bello and the person who had the honors of dumping the ice water on them was Hilaria Baldwin herself. 
Awesome! 
Here's what the Alec's lady wrote on her Instagram:

Sounds like a win win situation to us! 
We LOVE the person whom Alec nominated &#8212; we'd pay to see that happen!
But it wasn't just Alec who did the challenge &#8212; Hilaria did her own special version of it, as well! 
And it featured her upside down getting poured on by Alec while their daughter Carmen and their pup watched the show! 
And what a show it was!
See both wet action videos down (below) !!!
