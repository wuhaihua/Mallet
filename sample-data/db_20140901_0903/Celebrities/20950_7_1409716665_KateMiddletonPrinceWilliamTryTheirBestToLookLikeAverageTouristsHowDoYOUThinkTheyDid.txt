If you saw this couple strolling through Kings Cross Station with their dog, would YOU take a closer look?
We don't know that we would &#8212; which is exactly what Prince William and Kate Middleton were going for as they headed back to London from Norfolk on Friday! 
The royally fabulous pair dressed down to look like your average plebeians while hurrying through the train station, with both Will and Kate wearing jeans, sneakers, and caps at an attempt to hide their dashing good looks.
Additionally, the Prince even let the Duchess of Cambridge shoulder most of the luggage. How unchivalrous&#8230;which is probably exactly what he was going for! 
LOLz!!
Once out of the train station, the two lovebirds even hopped into an ordinary silver minivan to complete their journey. 
Sure, one paparazzi obviously recognized them and their precious pup Lupo enough to capture the moment, but overall their disguises looked pretty spot-on!
