Kate Mara Officially Splits From Max Minghella Kate Mara Officially Splits From Max Minghella 
We hate to see love end!
Kate Mara and Max Minghella have been together for nearly four years, but their time together is over, according to a new report. 
The House of Cards actress didnâ€™t arrive at the Emmys with Minghella, but instead had stylist Johnny Wujek as her arm candy for the night. Wujek also went with Kate to the Venice Film Festival this week too!
As for Max and Mara, they have been breaking up and getting back together nearly their entire time together so this split may only be for a little while as well. 
We're sending them both love and light!
