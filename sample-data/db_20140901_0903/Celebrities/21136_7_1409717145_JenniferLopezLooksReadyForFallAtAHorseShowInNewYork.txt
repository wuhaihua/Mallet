Jennifer Lopez Looks Ready For Fall At A Horse Show In New York! Jennifer Lopez Looks Ready For Fall At A Horse Show In New York! 
Everyone knows Jennifer Lopez for her Booty (and her Booty remix, ha!), but she doesn't even have to show that particular ASSet to stand out! 
The 45-year-old singer's derri√®re was fully covered on Sunday when she attended the 39th Annual Hampton Classic Horse Show in New York, and she still managed to turn heads. 
Also, like all the stores that are preemptively selling decor for October and November, JLo seems to be ready for fall!!
The flower print on her billowy Gucci maxi dress incorporated hues reminiscent of autumn leaves, with shades of  orange, yellow, and brown dominating the color palate. 
Some classic Jenny From The Block hoop earrings and a tightly wound topknot completed the outfit. 
While we normally wouldn't style this type of dress with hoops, the mother of two definitely makes it work!
