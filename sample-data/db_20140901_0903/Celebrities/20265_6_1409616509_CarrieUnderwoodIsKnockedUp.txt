Carrie Underwood Is Knocked Up Carrie Underwood Is Knocked Up 
				
								
				
Carrie Underwood used Labor Day to announce that in a few months she&#8217;ll be going into labor, because a fetus has moved into her womb. I tried to laugh at the cheesiness of her announcement, but I couldn&#8217;t, because up until I was 6 or 7 I really thought that Labor Day was a day to celebrate women birthing out babies. It&#8217;s a good thing I was totally wrong, because if I was right, we&#8217;d all be spending Labor Day making soap for the world&#8217;s labor queen Michelle Duggar. Oh, and by &#8220;6 or 7&#8243; I mean &#8220;a month ago.&#8221;
Carrie Underwears posted the above pic on Instagram today with this little note:
In honor of &#8220;Labor&#8221; Day, Ace &amp; Penny would like to make an announcement. Their parents couldn&#8217;t be happier&#8230;
No, Carrie isn&#8217;t announcing that she&#8217;s getting another dog. Carrie&#8217;s husband Mike Fisher tweeted this:
We haven&#8217;t picked names yet but it&#8217;s looking like Fly is gonna fly. #boyorgirl #flyfisherf
That&#8217;s nice and everything, but something tells me that Fly Underwears Fisher is going to be an only child. Because after Carrie threw that picture up on Instagram, Ace and Penny snuck out of the house and caught a Peter Pan bus to the farthest nudist dog colony where they can freely live without having to worry about hos forcing them to wear embarrassing t-shirts like that. You can see the shame in their body language.
