Lindsay Lohan’s PCH Crash Case Has Been Settled… Two Years Later! Lindsay Lohan’s PCH Crash Case Has Been Settled… Two Years Later! 
Money can buy freedom! Well, to a point anyway.
Two years ago, Lindsay Lohan crashed her Porsche 911S into a semi truck while driving on PCH, and then she lied saying that her assistant was driving!
But now it doesn’t really matter what she said because LiLo is done with this case for good!
The truck driver sued for mental and physical suffering, and while the exact terms of the settlement are confidential, Lindsay was able to pay the man and be done with the messy sitch.
And luckily for the 28-year-old actress, her insurance company is actually the one footing the bill. 
Apparently everyone wins this time around!
