Whoa, Kesha Snagged a Shockingly Understated Venice Beach Bungalow Whoa, Kesha Snagged a Shockingly Understated Venice Beach Bungalow 
                            
                    

        

        
            
                Kesha totally took us by surprise when she dropped $1.65 million on an immaculate Spanish-style bungalow right by Venice Beach, CA. Hollywood's favorite wild child chose a considerably small space at 1,400 square feet, but the home originally built in the 1920s is filled with charming old-world features. Arched doorways, hardwood floors, and a massive master bathroom are just a few of the enamoring featured in the singer's cozy new home.
The backyard is not the party venue we'd expect for the artist who brought glitter back, but Kesha can definitely host some intimate soirees on her tiled patio complete with an outdoor kitchen and hot tub. Interested in knowing where the Los Angeles native will be calling home? Take a peek at all the photos of Kesha's sophisticated new pad.
