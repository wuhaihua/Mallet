Over 30 Teens Escape From Tennessee Prison In Massive Jail Break!! Violent Young Offenders On The Loose! Over 30 Teens Escape From Tennessee Prison In Massive Jail Break!! Violent Young Offenders On The Loose! 
Around 11 p.m. last night, over 30 teenagers escaped from a Nashville detention center &#8212; and they aren't just some wayward youths on the loose, either.
These are young criminals, some of them very violent, with at least three felonies each.
And 32 of them were loose. 
The good news is that as of this writing, only eight prisoners were still on the lam.
The teens, aged 14-17, escaped by overwhelming 16-18 prison staff members, then slipped under a fence around the jail.
We really hope they round up the rest of these teens!
Last thing we need is a bunch of car chases or violence!
Check out the video (below) to learn a little more about this developing story.
