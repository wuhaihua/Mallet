Family Of The Uzi Instructor Who Was Accidentally Killed By A 9-Year-Old Girl Speaks Out — See What They Said About The Tragic Accident Family Of The Uzi Instructor Who Was Accidentally Killed By A 9-Year-Old Girl Speaks Out — See What They Said About The Tragic Accident 
These are some brave and amazing kids. 
Former gun instructor Charles Vacca was accidentally killed by a 9-year-old girl during a session where he was teaching her how to fire an Uzi at an Arizona shooting range this past Monday. 
The 39-year-old was a father and his death broke the hearts of his ex-wife and all of his children. 
However they do NOT want that little girl's accident to haunt her for the rest of her life, and their first interview was more about that sentiment than the loss of their beloved poppa. 
Here's what Charles Vacca's 19-year-old daughter Ashley said in the TODAY interview:

Ashley also plans to write to the little girl and her family to let them know THEY know it was a "tragic accident."
Charles Vacca's ex wife Anamarie said: 

Pretty amazing how these children are able to push aside their grief to look out for the little girl so soon after the death of their beloved father. 
He may have left them way too early, but it sounds like they'll be able to carry on. 
Still awfully sad story though.
