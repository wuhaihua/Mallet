Jennifer Lopez's Unsuccessful Relationship With Casper Smart Isn't Stopping Her From Believing In Love - She's Still In The Game! Jennifer Lopez's Unsuccessful Relationship With Casper Smart Isn't Stopping Her From Believing In Love - She's Still In The Game! 
If there's anyone who knows about love and going through the motions, it's Jennifer Lopez!
Jenny from the Block has gone through her fair share of men throughout her remarkable career, so she knows a thing or two about being in love. 
The American Idol judge and her beau, Casper Smart, recently went their separate ways, but that doesn't mean J.Lo has given up on love!
As a matter of fact, the songbird is still searching for Mr. Right!
The proud mother of two is taking it all in stride, saying she (and everyone else) is guilty of moving too quickly in a relationship. She said: 

If you think J.Lo has given up on finding The One after her last relationship, you're out of your mind!
She said:

We absolutely love her positive spirit!
With that kind of attitude, there's no doubt Jennifer will find her one and only soon enough!
