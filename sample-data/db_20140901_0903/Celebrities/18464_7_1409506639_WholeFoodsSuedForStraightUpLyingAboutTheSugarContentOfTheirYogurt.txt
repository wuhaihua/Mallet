Whole Foods Sued For Straight Up Lying About The Sugar Content Of Their Yogurt Whole Foods Sued For Straight Up Lying About The Sugar Content Of Their Yogurt 
Whole Foods is generally thought of as a place where you can get a lot of unique, really healthy food for a pretty hefty price.
Some customers are now really upset that they got waaaaay more than they paid for, though, when they found out their Whole Foods store brand yogurt had a lot more sugar in it than was advertised.
Over five times more sugar to be exact! 
About 100 customers are suing Whole Foods after several Consumer Reports tests found that Whole Foods 365 Everyday Value Plain Greek Yogurt had 11.4 grams of sugar per 170 gram serving.
It's listed as having only 2 grams of sugar.
The suit states:

Jeez! That sounds like straight up fraud to us! We're angry FOR those people who are suing!
They're suing for $5,000,000 in damges btw.
Whole Foods responded to the lawsuit, saying:

Yeah, you better investigate those claims!
Seriously, how does something like that slip past people?
Next time, let's hope they're less sneaky and maybe people won't sue them.
