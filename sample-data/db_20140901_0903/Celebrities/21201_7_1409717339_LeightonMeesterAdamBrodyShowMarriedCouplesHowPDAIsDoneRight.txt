Leighton Meester & Adam Brody Show Married Couples How PDA Is Done Right! Leighton Meester & Adam Brody Show Married Couples How PDA Is Done Right! 
Married life sure looks good on these two!
How totally cute are Leighton Meester and her hand-holding hubby, Adam Brody?!
We knew this couple was enjoying the married life, but it's also nice to see the picture proof.
The duo was spotted all casual and cute while dining at the Inn of the Seventh Ray in Topanga, California this Labor Day weekend.
Just based on this hand holding, we're guessing these two might be on their way to having those 12 babies Adam talked about sooner than anyone might've thought!
Although, we might not be ready for that just yet because can you picture how overwhelmingly cute it'll be to see them holding hands with a little one?? 
Squeeee!
