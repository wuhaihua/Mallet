Philadelphia’s Made In America Festival Was Almost Cancelled Due To Thunderstorms! Philadelphia’s Made In America Festival Was Almost Cancelled Due To Thunderstorms! 
It’s like Momma Nature just hates music or something!
Philadelphia had one of the most epic lineups for the Made in America festival this weekend, but it was almost cancelled because of thunderstorms!
At about 6:15 pm, people were told over the speakers to evacuate the site, but to remain calm.
The City of Philadelphia, Roc Nation and Live Nation all okay-ed the decision to have everyone leave momentarily, before being told they could go back in an hour later. 
The festival’s official Twitter kept fans informed throughout the unexpected exodus, saying:
PHILLY, due to approaching severe weather, everyone should move quickly &amp; calmly to exit &amp; proceed to protected areas outside of the site.


PHILLY: Thank you for your patience. Doors to the festival have been re-opened! Please return calmly to the nearest entrance.


And the good news is that nobody was hurt!
Ch-ch-check out the footage of everything going down (below)!
