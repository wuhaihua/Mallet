Kanye West Tells The Made In America Crowd What Happened When He Confronted Jay Pharoah About His VMAs Spoof! Kanye West Tells The Made In America Crowd What Happened When He Confronted Jay Pharoah About His VMAs Spoof! 
We wonder if he knows it’s okay to laugh sometimes?
During the MTV VMAs, host and comedian Jay Pharoah &#8212; who is known for his impersonations &#8212; spoofed Kanye West, and it’s was pretty HIGHlarious!
But apparently Kanye didn’t think so.
And since the 37-year-old rapper was on stage at the Made in America festival in Philly on Saturday, he went on one of his patented rants. Only this time is was about what he said to Jay, and about how he’s in an interracial relationship. Kanye said:

Oh Kanye! There is so much to say about his rant, but we’ll just stop because it’s Kanye! The man says what he wants when he wants! LOLz!
Ye should maybe have a little chat with Kim Kardashian and her sisters too, because the camera caught them laughing at Jay’s jokes! When they weren’t texting anyways…
Thoughts???
