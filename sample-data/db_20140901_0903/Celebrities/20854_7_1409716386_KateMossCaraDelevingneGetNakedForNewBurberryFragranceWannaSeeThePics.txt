Two modeling icons under one roof!
It must've been electric during this Burberry shoot with Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne for the new fragrance, My Burberry!
Especially since at one point they seemed to get naked together! Rawr!
Cara is often called the "new Kate" so it was fitting for them to hook up for the British brand. Though they don't quite look alike, they both exude that same cool-girl vibe that makes them so attractive to others!
We can only hope this is the beginning of more collaborations between the two!
Check out more photos in the gallery (above)!
