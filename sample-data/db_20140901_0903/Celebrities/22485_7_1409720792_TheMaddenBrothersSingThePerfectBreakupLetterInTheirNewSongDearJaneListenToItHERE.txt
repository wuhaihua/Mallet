The Madden Brothers Sing The Perfect Breakup Letter In Their New Song Dear Jane! Listen To It HERE! The Madden Brothers Sing The Perfect Breakup Letter In Their New Song Dear Jane! Listen To It HERE! 

Writing a breakup letter is tough, but singing one? That takes some serious skill!
The Madden Brothers have accomplished both feats in their new song Dear Jane! And although we feel sorry for whoever this Jane girl happens to be, at least she got a great song out of parting ways!
This new song's release makes us want the whole album to come out now! Oh well, we guess we'll just have to wait patiently&#8230;or impatiently. Yeah, probably impatiently because they're AH-Mazing! 
Ch-ch-check out the new ditty (above)!!!
