It's official - One Direction fans want Miley Cyrus as their next queen!
In an unofficial poll, One Direction fans chose Miley as Harry Styles' ideal leading lady. 
Mileybird should be very flattered because she beat out super hotties like Selena Gomez and Katy Perry.
We think Miles and Harry would make a cute couple, especially since they both have such a great sense of humor.
Remember the time Harry dressed up as Miley for Halloween?
Or when Miley snuggled with a cardboard cut-out of Harry?
Maybe this is a sign Miley and Harry are really meant to be!!
We're keeping our fingers crossed!
