Celebrate good times, c’mon! 
Lea Michele rang in the big 2-8 on Friday with some of her best friends a super yummy cake!
The Glee actress shared several snaps from her big night at Club W, which was actually pretty tame, by Hollywood standards!
Lea looked lovely in her black ensem and glam tresses, while celebrating with the small dinner party of 10, which included Once Upon A Time actress Joanna Garcia Swisher!
Unfortunately, Lea’s new boyfriend, Matthew Paetz, wasn’t spotted in any of the pics, but we’re sure he had a great surprise for his leading lady!
Food writer Claire Thomas explained the birthday girl’s vision for the dinner, saying:

Aww! That sounds delish!
Happy birthday, Miz Michele! We hope all of your wishes came true!
