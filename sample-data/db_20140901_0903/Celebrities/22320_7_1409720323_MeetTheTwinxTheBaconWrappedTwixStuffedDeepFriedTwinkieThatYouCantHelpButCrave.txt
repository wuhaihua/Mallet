Meet The Twinx: The Bacon-Wrapped, Twix-Stuffed, Deep-Fried Twinkie That You Can't Help But Crave Meet The Twinx: The Bacon-Wrapped, Twix-Stuffed, Deep-Fried Twinkie That You Can't Help But Crave 
Twinx are invading the New York!
No, not that kind.
What's actually happening is that a food truck in Syracuse has concocted a Twinkie stuffed with a Twix, wrapped in bacon, and then deep fried.
That's right. 
The Fried Specialties food truck is known for making up wild fried foods, and this year at the Great New York State Fair is no different.
When asked about the health 'benefits' of the snack, Twinx creator James Hasbrouk responded, saying:

Fair enough.
At only about 1,000 calories, the Twinx isn't as bad as it sounds. Especially compared to all the other crazy creations we've heard of before.
Seriously! Just consider the deep-fried Twinkie burger, KFC's infamous double down, or anything that Paula Deen has ever made, and a trip to the fair might not sound like such a bad idea.
But still, we'd probably steer clear of the Twinx if we were you.
