Jewel Is Looking Lovelier Than Thou On The Beach At The Bahamas! Jewel Is Looking Lovelier Than Thou On The Beach At The Bahamas! 
Make way!
Hawt momma coming through!
Jewel was born in cold Utah and raised in freezing Alaska, but the 40-year-old singer looked quite at ease in her awesome red bikini on the beach in the Bahamas. 
The lady in red was there taking a break in the sun before her Paradise lsland gig on Saturday for the Atlantis Live: Paradise Music Festival. 
We had some idea how hot this lady was, but we had NO idea how freakin' beautiful all of this lady is especially accentuated with nothing on but a red bikini and a floppy straw hat! 
Here's what she wrote when she shared the pic on Instagram:

If this is just another day in Jewel's life - we want some of what she's having, ha! 
Hopefully this won't be the last of the bikini vacation pics we see from this lady - she's way too beautiful to stop now!
