Chloë Grace Moretz & Brooklyn Beckham Have ANOTHER Concert Date! And Jaden Smith Is Their 3rd Wheel! Chloë Grace Moretz & Brooklyn Beckham Have ANOTHER Concert Date! And Jaden Smith Is Their 3rd Wheel! 
These two must REALLY love music! It's their second concert in one weekend!
Chloë Grace Moretz and her maybe possibly probably boyfriend Brooklyn Beckham were spotted getting their groove on at the 2014 Made in America Festival in El Lay over the weekend and they looked adorable! 
Plus they were joined by their friend Jaden Smith! 
The question that comes to mind, however, is are these two actually dating?!?
Chloe WAS spotted hand-in-hand with a guy she was rumored to be dating in New York the other week, but we dunno! 
Her and Brooklyn sure do spend a lot of time together! 
But that COULD be because they both like music and skateboarding and just like to hang out because they're friends?
Whatever the truth is, we like seeing these two together! They're adorable!
