Dayum! Lily Allen has been flaunting her toned figure left and right these days!
Following her bikini babe shot posted to Instagram, the sexy songstress was all about putting her abs on display when she hit the Chiltern Firehouse in London yesterday.
Wearing a bright yellow crop top complemented by a leather jacket and jogging pants, Lily was hard to miss!
And that was only furthered when she topped off her already sporty ensem with sneaks, copper headphones, and a purple MCM clutch. 
While it didn't necessarily mesh well for a night out, we have to give her credit for matching her bangs to her accessories! 
That's commitment!
