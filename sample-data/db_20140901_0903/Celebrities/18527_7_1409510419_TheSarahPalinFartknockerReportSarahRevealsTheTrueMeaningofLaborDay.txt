The Sarah Palin Fartknocker Report: Sarah Reveals The True Meaning of Labor Day The Sarah Palin Fartknocker Report: Sarah Reveals The True Meaning of Labor Day When Sarah Palin announced her new online channel, Wonkette commenter Fartknocker ponied up the coin to buy us a year-long subscription, plus a couple beers for our troubles. 
This week&#8217;s installment of The Sarah Palin Fartknocker Report, Presented By Fartknocker, features Sarah getting everything wrong about Labor Day. We have no other way to describe what is going on here, and we&#8217;re not sure why Palin put this video out in the first place.
It start with some facts about the history of Labor Day that Sarah found on Wikipedia, about how hard-workin&#8217; people built America. What do Republicans think of hard-workin&#8217; Americans, you ask? &#8220;Fer &#8216;em!&#8221; Sarah replies. But then she brings up how Todd was in a union &#8212; elected treasurer, even! &#8212; and how that was fine because Todd was helpin&#8217; some hard-workin&#8217; guys up in Alaska, whereas the &#8220;union thugs,&#8221; the ones runnin&#8217; the unions, they&#8217;re no good. She concludes this rambling saying that the true meaning of Labor Day is not about politics.
At the end of the video, she takes a moment to address everyone who doesn&#8217;t have Labor Day off, and she thanks them for coming to work that day.

Palin has overwhelmed our defenses. There is so much in that video that is so relentlessly, so aggressively wrong that we legitimately don&#8217;t know where to begin. We&#8217;re beginning to regret taking on this assignment.
