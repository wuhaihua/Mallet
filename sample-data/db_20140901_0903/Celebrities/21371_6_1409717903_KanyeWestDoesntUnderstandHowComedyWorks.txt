Kanye West Doesn’t Understand How Comedy Works Kanye West Doesn’t Understand How Comedy Works 
				
								
				
Kanye West has repeatedly told us that he&#8217;s the smartest man in the world (or whatever he claims during his daily crazy pants ranting) except he clearly doesn&#8217;t understand what impressions are, or how comedy works, or what humor is. Ironic, really, considering he&#8217;s married to a clown.
During the Made in America festival in Philadelphia on Saturday, Us Weekly says that Kim Kardashian&#8217;s kurrent husband took deliver said crazy pants rant to the audience about SNL comedian Jay Pharoah&#8217;s impression of him at the VMAs last Sunday. Pharoah, seen above at the VMAs looking like Kanye if Kanye was an active granny from Boca Raton, kept it pretty inoffensive, but Kanye was SO upset that someone would DARE have the audacity to poke fun at him, so Kanye called Jay Pharoah to inform him that his Kanye spoof at the VMAs and his &#8220;Waking Up with Kimye&#8221; sketch from SNL isn&#8217;t funny. Kanye explained to the audience (who probably had 0.00 fucks to give, honestly) that Jay should be PRAISING him, not parodying him.
&#8220;They want to make a joke out of how hard we work. It&#8217;s fine and all funny and everything, but don&#8217;t distract from our vision. It&#8217;s not a joke what we do up here. This music that we do is not a joke. What we do culturally is not a joke.&#8221;
&#8220;I called Jay Pharoah right after the MTV awards,. I said, &#8216;I appreciate your show, but let me tell you about my story. Let me tell you about what I went through to get to that position’ … So we ain&#8217;t gonna have no black comedians going onstage spoofing the people that&#8217;s working hard, and helping the next man out.”
&#8220;For me to be in a very publicized interracial relationship is not a joke. It&#8217;s something that should be treated with respect cause we’re all in this together.”
Kanye is so crazy, so I doubt the Jay Pharoah he spoke to wasn&#8217;t even the one from SNL. Kanye was probably just calling up random phone numbers in Egypt and demanding to speak to someone named Pharoah, and eventually he found a group of stoned teenagers who were like &#8220;Yes, this is Pharoah&#8221; and listened to him rant on speakerphone while they played Xbox Live. After 2 hours of crazy, they got bored and told him that Pharoah needed to go on a mystical journey to visit Osiris and he&#8217;d be really busy for the next 4,000 years, so don&#8217;t call back.
Meanwhile, while Kanye was talking to &#8220;Pharoah&#8221;, Kim was spotted talking to a picture of Nasim Pedrad her assistant found on the internet and asking if she could teach her how to keep her eyes open and her mouth closed while doing a Kim Kardashian impression. &#8220;It&#8217;s so hard to do in real life. You&#8217;re a really good at it!&#8221;
And here&#8217;s Kanye looking miserable as always with his &#8220;hard working&#8221; wife and North West leaving LAX and arriving in London earlier this morning. Don&#8217;t laugh, you guys, Kim works so hard! It&#8217;s hard work trying to arrange photo ops with your baby at the airport! She&#8217;s the hardest working narcoleptic-faced hooker around!
