BREAKING NEWS: I am no longer a @CNN employee.


I was offered a new 2-year deal by @CNN boss Jeff Zucker to host 40 big interview &#39;specials&#39;.


But after considerable thought, I decided not to accept it - and to try pastures new.


I had a fantastic time in my 4 years @CNN and have huge respect for Jeff &amp; all the people who work there. Great company, great network.
