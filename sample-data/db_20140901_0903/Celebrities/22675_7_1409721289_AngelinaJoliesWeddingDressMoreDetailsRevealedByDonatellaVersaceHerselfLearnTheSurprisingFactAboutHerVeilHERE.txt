Ooooh! Secrets from the designer herself! 
Angelina Jolie's wedding dress is truly a work of art, so it's no surprise that it was Atelier Versace! 
Which means that Donatella Versace was one of the geniuses behind the design of the gown! 
Along with giving some well-wishes to Angie, the famed designer has spoken out about the details of the custom-made silk-satin dress and we're seriously in awe. 
That veil that her kids 'drew pictures on' wasn't actually drawn on at all! In fact those pictures were hand-embroidered reproductions of their drawings! 
Plus, the Maleficent actress ALSO wore Versace silk pumps! 
Very loyal to the brand, we see! LOL.
Donatella also wished Angie well in married life, saying:

Aww! How sweet of her! 
We still can't BELIEVE how gorgeous Angie looked in that dress! 
Plus, we love her even more for having her children be a major part of her outfit!
