Apple Releases Statement Regarding The Hacked Celebrity Photos & Admits It's Not Their Fault! Says It Was A 'Targeted Attack!' Apple Releases Statement Regarding The Hacked Celebrity Photos & Admits It's Not Their Fault! Says It Was A 'Targeted Attack!' 
Looks like we may be one step closer to finding out who was behind the photo hacking scandal and hopefully sending the culprit to jail!
After Jennifer Lawrence, Victoria Justice, Kate Upton, and A LOT more celebrity women were victims of a HUGE hacking, everyone turned to Apple wondering what happened. 
Since it was the women's PRIVATE iCloud accounts that the pictures were stolen from.
Well, it turns out, after 40 hours of investigation, Apple has found out that it WASN'T a program-wide problem. 
This was a 'targeted attack' of the women's accounts.
Apple said:

'We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple’s engineers to discover the source. Our customers’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. 
After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. 

Well, it's nice to know that it's not a problem for the non-celebs. However, this makes the entire situation THAT MUCH WORSE. 
Seriously, they definitely need to find and prosecute this guy as soon as humanly possible. 
We can't imagine how terrible this invasion of privacy must have felt like. 
Fingers crossed they catch this person ASAP!
