Joan Rivers Is Being Brought Out Of Her Medically Induced Coma! Joan Rivers Is Being Brought Out Of Her Medically Induced Coma! 
This could be good news!
Joan Rivers has been in a medically induced coma since last Thursday, after going into cardiac and respiratory arrest while she was having a procedure on her vocal cords.
As of Sunday, doctors were bringing Joan out of the coma, but they’re not sure what to expect on the other side. A source explained:

In the meantime, Joan’s daughter Melissa Rivers is thinking of suing the hospital where the 81-year-old’s initial procedure was botched! A different insider said:

So sad! 
Melissa gave another statement on Sunday, where she told people, “We are keeping our fingers crossed.”
We’ll keep ours crossed too! And send lots of positive thoughts the family’s way.
Joan is a fighter, so hopefully Tuesday brings good news!
