Beyoncé Is Just Like Us — Or So She'd Like Us To Believe! Spotted Boozing It Up With Solange On The Holiday Weekend! Beyoncé Is Just Like Us — Or So She'd Like Us To Believe! Spotted Boozing It Up With Solange On The Holiday Weekend! 
This momma knows how to let loose!
She still has her big On The Run finale to prepare for, but this weekend was all about Beyoncé getting boozy with the family!
Or at least that’s what she wants us to think!
The 32-year-old singer posted a picture on Instagram of herself and sister Solange literally letting their hair down over the long weekend with a couple of beers in-hand!
But we’re not so convinced that they were really drankin' since both of the bottles are still full! LOLz!
Then again, who can pay attention to the drinks for long when Bey’s fab figure is on full display?!
It’s great to see them spending family time together too! Loves it!
