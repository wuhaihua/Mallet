Kendall Jenner's New Motto: No Pants, No Problem! Kendall Jenner's New Motto: No Pants, No Problem! 
Eh, who needs pants anyways??
Kendall Jenner showed just how overrated they are by flashing her pins around NYC on Saturday!
The reality TV starlet slash supermodel must've been all about that breeze as she gave passer bys an eyeful in Stone Cold Fox’s slitty white gown, paired with just a long striped American Apparel tee underneath.
And to finish off her cool ensem, Kendall accessorized with a black Celine tote and the label’s slip on sneakers.
There's no doubt that this gurlie has the off-duty model look down pat! Do U agree???
