Game Of Thrones & Hunger Games Hotties Could Be Bringing The Fandoms Together In Their New Movie Me Before You! Game Of Thrones & Hunger Games Hotties Could Be Bringing The Fandoms Together In Their New Movie Me Before You! 
Brace yourselves.
It looks like two of the most rabid fan bases around might be getting a crossover in the near future.
That's because Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin from The Hunger Games are in negotiations to star in Me Before You.
The upcoming movie is an adaptation of the best selling YA novel about a down-on-her-luck small town girl and a boy who is new to having to use a wheelchair after an accident.
While we love Emilia and Sam, we don't really like the idea of casting someone who can walk in a role meant for an actor in a wheelchair. But, the powers that be will probably just make some excuse about flashback scenes or something to justify it.
The adaptation of Jojo Moyes' 2012 novel is being made into a film by MGM and is set to hit theaters in August 2015.
We're getting a very Fault In Our Stars vibe from all of this, and we can get behind that!
However, since these are just negotiations, and not even final ones at that, the official casting could see neither of these young actors in the roles.
But, seeing how huge they are in pop culture right now, we doubt we'll be seeing anything different.
