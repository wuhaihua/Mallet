Yes, we already saw both David Gandy and Benedict Cumberbatch today, but do you see that hotness? You expect me not to bring it to your attention? Yeah, that&#8217;s what I thought.
 and here it is. I didn&#8217;t even remember it was today.
But thank goodness, cause hot dudes are always appreciated.Â 
hello 2013 gq men of the year awardsI mean, you can&#8217;t tell me that Bradley Cooper, Jamie Dornan, David and Benedict aren&#8217;t a good line up. Plus there&#8217;s so many more. God I love the red carpet. As far as misses go there&#8217;s only one: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Kim was there to pick up the Woman of the Year Award, but her outfits is zee worst.
You can check out the full list of winners here. I&#8217;m quite into Jamie winning things. Jamie should win everything. Or David. Or Benedict. Actually, give them all joint awards. Launch the gallery to check out all the dude hotness. Who&#8217;s your favorite? I think I&#8217;m into Benedict. That black suit/black shirt/black tie is really doing it for me.
