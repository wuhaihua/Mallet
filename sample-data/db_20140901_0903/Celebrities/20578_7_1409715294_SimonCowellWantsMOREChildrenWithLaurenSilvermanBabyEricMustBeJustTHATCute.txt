Simon Cowell hasn't been a father for even a full year but he must be loving the hell out of it.
He and his girlfriend Lauren Silverman have Eric together, their super adorable baby boy, and they are just such a happy little family.
Simon is so in love with his baby that he's already considering having another one!!
He said: 

Of course we're sure he'd love another kid, but maybe he should master raising one child before having a second&#8230;&#8230;. he apparently still has yet to change a diaper (or 'nappy' in British English)! He said:

Ha! We hope thats a joke!
Though honestly we wouldn't put it past him! LOLz!
