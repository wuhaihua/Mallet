Michael Sam Isn’t Signed To St. Louis Rams’ Practice Squad Either! Michael Sam Isn’t Signed To St. Louis Rams’ Practice Squad Either! 
Nooo!!!
When we heard that Michael Sam had been cut from the St. Louis Rams’ roster, we were still hoping they’d keep him on their practice squad!
But it just wasn’t to be, despite all of the nice words that coach Jeff Fisher had to say. 
Sam was hoping to become the NFL's first openly gay player, but he got cut from the 53-man roster, then while he was on waivers, the team filled up their 10-man practice squad.
Fisher met with Sam on Sunday to explain the team’s reasoning though. Since the team was thinner at other positions, that’s who filled up the practice team. No one who plays the same position as Sam made the 10-man squad.
So it wasn’t a personal thing at all!
The 24-year-old tweeted after being cut on Saturday and sounded very resilient! He hasn’t tweeted since this latest round of bad news though. 
It’s okay Michael! We know you’ll make it somewhere!
