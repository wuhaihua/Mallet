Swish!
Iggy Azalea may have just become even more impressive to her NBA playin' boyfriend, Nick Young.
That's because the Fancy singer is actually pretty handy with a basketball, as it turns out. 
We already knew that the hot couple likes to hit up the Beverly Hills night life and make award show appearances together, but it looks like they may just have another thing in common.
On a date night to the Lakers training gym on Saturday, Swaggy P posted a video to Instagram of Iggy making an impressive behind-the-hoops trick shot.
He captioned the video, saying:

We're really impressed with Iggy's shooting skills!
Is there anything the 24-year-old Australian rapper can't do?
Ch-ch-check out Iggy's totally fantastic trick shot (below)!
