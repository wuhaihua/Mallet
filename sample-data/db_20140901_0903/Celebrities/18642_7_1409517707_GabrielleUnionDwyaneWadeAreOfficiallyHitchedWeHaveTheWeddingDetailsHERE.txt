They finally did it!
After four years of dating, and a pretty scandalous engagement period, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union officially tied the knot on Saturday at Chateau Artisan in Miami.
The Being Mary Jane star looked gorgeous in her custom Dennis Basso gown, while Dwyane was dapper in his custom DSquared2 suit, which both went with the black and white theme of the night.
And in their first portrait as man and wife, Gabby looks gorgeous with a bouquet of white roses, and soft curls framing her face. 
In attendance were Kevin Hart, reality TV star Jonathan Cheban, Miami Heat player Chris Bosh and his wife Adrienne, along with John Legend, who performed for the couple. 
This is the second marriage for both Union and Wade, but weâ€™re sure this one is going to last a lifetime!
Congrats to the newlyweds!
