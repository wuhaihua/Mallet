We guess Nick Lachey was at home taking care of Camden!
That's because his wifey and baby momma Vanessa Lachey was spotted out and about in Beverly Hills doing some doctor appointment attending this past Friday!
And she took her large and in charge baby bump with her! 
Although we don't think she had a choice in that, ha! 
We LOVE how big Vanessa's baby bump is getting, and we can't wait to watch it keep growing until it finally&#8230;
&#8230;Well, you know! 
Pops!!!
