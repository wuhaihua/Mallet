Emma Stone & Andrew Garfield Refrain From Holding Hands In Italy! Why The Low Profile, Guys?? Emma Stone & Andrew Garfield Refrain From Holding Hands In Italy! Why The Low Profile, Guys?? 
Aw! Feeling a little camera shy, you two??
Or is Andrew Garfield totally regretting his lumberjack-esque look now?
Emma Stone and her boyfy were spotted leaving the 71st Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on Saturday.
The adorable twosome are usually picture perfect when they're caught out and about, but on this particular day they decided to keep a low profile!
Emma shielded her face from the flashing lights while Andrew developed a nail biting habit!
It looks like the Amazing Spider-Man star is still carrying around that cane he had when he first touched down in Venice! 
Maybe Emma's just embarrassed by his new woodsy wardrobe Andrew has been sporting as of late!
