Aaaand I&#8217;m back from my vacation in Mehico and yes, I swallowed the tequila worm and sadly no, that&#8217;s not a euphemism. Thanks to Allison, J. Harvey and Lahoma for covering for my ass while I spent my mornings flirting with the members of the Mexican Navy who tried to rescue me after mistaking me for a malnourished, beached seal and spent my afternoon writing, &#8220;But what about the cum?&#8220;, to every goddamn friend who texted me with, &#8220;You&#8217;re in Mexico? Don&#8217;t drink the water!&#8221;
There&#8217;s no better way to end my first full day back than by posting stunning pictures of the opulent German blossom who bloomed in the Garden of Chola Beauty after Glamberace&#8217;s seed was fertilized with Liberace&#8217;s tears and a melted Sharpie. Harald Glööckler debuted his new equestrian line (???) at Spoga Horse in Cologne, Germany yesterday. That Maleficent horse he&#8217;s posing with was actually a living, breathing, galloping, blood relative of Trace Cyrus until Harald touched it and it turned into pure gold. Even though it&#8217;s an inanimate object and its eyes are made of glass, that gold horse still looks shocked to be so close to such understated glamour.
