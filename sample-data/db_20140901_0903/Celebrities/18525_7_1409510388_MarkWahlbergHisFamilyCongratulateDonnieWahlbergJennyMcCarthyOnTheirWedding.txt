Mark Wahlberg & His Family Congratulate Donnie Wahlberg & Jenny McCarthy On Their Wedding! Mark Wahlberg & His Family Congratulate Donnie Wahlberg & Jenny McCarthy On Their Wedding! 

Well, this is a good sign, right?!
Rumors came out yesterday that the reason Mark Wahlberg wouldn’t be at brother Donnie Wahlberg’s wedding to Jenny McCarthy is because Marky Mark and his family weren’t fans of the bride!
Well, that and they were celebrating his daughter Ella’s birthday.
But the 43-year-old took to Facebook to record a video showing nothing but love for the new couple (above)!
Still, we can’t help but think Donnie’s own brother should have somehow made it to the wedding!
Thoughts???
