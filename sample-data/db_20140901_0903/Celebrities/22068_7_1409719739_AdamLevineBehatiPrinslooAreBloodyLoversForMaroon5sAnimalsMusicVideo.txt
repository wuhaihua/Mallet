This is the hottest bloody scene we've seen since The Vampire Diaries!!!
Adam Levine is finally making wifey Behati Prinsloo a video gurl, and it seems like the blood won't be the only facet making this Animals music video X-rated!!!! 
Besides getting nekkid and close for this  Instagram taken on set in El Lay, the pretty twosome were spotted tongue dancing for the cameras and walking around in some more BARELY THERE clothing. 
Sounds pretty ANIMALISTIC to us! HA! 
We like where Maroon 5's musical direction is going! LOLz!
