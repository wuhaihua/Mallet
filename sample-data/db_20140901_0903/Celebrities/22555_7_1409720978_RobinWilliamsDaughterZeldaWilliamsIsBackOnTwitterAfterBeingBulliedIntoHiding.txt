Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Williams Is Back On Twitter After Being Bullied Into Hiding! Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Williams Is Back On Twitter After Being Bullied Into Hiding! 
When Robin Williams died, the world was crushed.
But some residents of planet earth were hit harder than others &#8212; we can't even begin to imagine what Zelda Williams felt like.
So we were super heart broken when we learned she was literally bullied off of Twitter after her father's death. 
We seriously find it hard to believe that people could be so heartless as to troll a girl whose father just died.
But those awful people exist and they basically forced Zelda to abandon her social media account, with her posting:
I&#39;m sorry. I should&#39;ve risen above. Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye.


Thankfully, due to what we assume was great support from family and friends, Zelda is doing alright.
She's doing so well that she's back online!
She tweeted again, simply writing "Thank you," and sharing a link to a quote on tumbler that read:
"Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself."

That's awesome! What a great quote!
She's taking control of her own life and won't let internet trolls keep her down.
Way to go, Zelda! You rock!
