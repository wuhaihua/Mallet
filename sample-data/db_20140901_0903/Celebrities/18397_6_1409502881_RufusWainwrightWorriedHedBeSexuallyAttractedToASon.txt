Rufus Wainwright Worried He’d Be Sexually Attracted To A Son Rufus Wainwright Worried He’d Be Sexually Attracted To A Son 
				
								
				
And we&#8217;re going to need you to keep worrying about that, Rufus, and please look into a vasectomy. Stat. To quote Michael K. when he brought this story to my attention &#8211; &#8220;theeee fuck.&#8221; In an interview with The Times, Rufus Wainwright casually mentioned that he was happy to have fathered a daughter (Viva, in February 2011) because he &#8220;would hate to be attracted to a son.&#8221; Pretty sure the son would feel the same way.
&#8216;I don’t think it would happen,&#8217; he apparently laughed in response. &#8216;[It's just that] when I&#8217;m old and he is 35 and gorgeous&#8230;
&#8216;Well he would probably look like me. And I would be like, &#8220;Oh my God! I’m falling in love with myself!&#8221;&#8216;
Honesty = not always the best policy. Rupert was really telling the editor in his head to fuck off that day because he also explained away not having a gay following by claiming that &#8220;gay men have terrible taste in music.&#8221; Look, I&#8217;m not going to rabidly argue that point (my iTunes library shames me), but that&#8217;s still a pretty sweeping generalization, you pretentious, hypothetically incestuous twat.
