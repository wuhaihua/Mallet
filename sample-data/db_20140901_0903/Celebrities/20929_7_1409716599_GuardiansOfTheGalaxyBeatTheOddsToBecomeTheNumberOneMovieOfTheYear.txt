Guardians Of The Galaxy Beat The Odds To Become The Number One Movie Of The Year! Guardians Of The Galaxy Beat The Odds To Become The Number One Movie Of The Year! 
Guardians Of The Galaxy saved the day again!
Labor Day weekend found Marvel's space heroes on top of the box office once again with a $22.2 million domestic take.
This makes GOTG the only movie this summer to be number one on three different weekends, a fact made even more impressive because it came back AFTER losing to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for two weeks!
This brings the total domestic gross to over $280 million, making it the biggest box office hit of the entire year!
Interestingly enough, the movies it beat are Marvel's other hit Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Chris Pratt's other hit The LEGO Movie!
A talking raccoon and a walking tree don't seem like such a long shot now!
We're guessing everyone at Disney is going to be Grooting this week!
