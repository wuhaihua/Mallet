Angelina Jolie In Her Wedding Dress - Your First Look HERE! Angelina Jolie In Her Wedding Dress - Your First Look HERE! 
Angelina Jolie kept it classic for her wedding dress to longtime love Brad Pitt.
However, the stunning bride's outfit was anything but simple. In fact, it was filled with a lot of special meaning.
Luigi Massi, the master tailor at Atelier Versace, sewed dozens of designs from her children's drawings into the dress and veil. 
"Luigi is like family to me and I couldn't imagine anyone else making this dress," Jolie tells People magazine. "He knows and cares for the children and it was great fun putting it together." 
As always, Jolie made her special day not about her but about her family. Yet another reason we love this woman so much!!!!
