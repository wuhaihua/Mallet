Europe is one lucky continent!
Britney Spears is going to be visiting its shores this month to promote her lingerie line, The Intimate Britney Spears!
First stop will be in London where Brit Brit will make a glamorous appearance at a special event on September 23, before heading off to Copenhagen, Denmark to promote the line further with a fashion show!
The Denmark event will also feature performances by Danish superstars like Joey Moe, Ida Corr, and a special guest (not Britney, though).
This is so exciting because not only do we get to see more of the line, but we get to see Britney all dolled up and walking the red carpet! We LOVE it when she does that! 
It's gonna be super serious fun timez, people!
Also, the collection will be available only on ASOS.com from September 23 to October 23, after which it will be available on Brit's website and at various retailers.
Our body is ready! Is yours???
