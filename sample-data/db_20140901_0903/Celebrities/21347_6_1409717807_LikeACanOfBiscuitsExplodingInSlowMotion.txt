Dear Kanye,
Thank you for this. Just thank you.
Love,
The world
Kanye West might be a tampon dipped in liquid delusion, but when it comes to making the world barf up a river of HAHAHAs by making Kim Kartrashian look as ridiculously messy as possible, he&#8217;s the master. Kanye continued to do great work tonight by doing Kim up like an S&amp;M medieval mermaid who just swallowed a seal whole and is having a bitch of a time trying to pass it. Kim wore this beautiful and stunning ensemble to the GQ Men of the Year Awards in London where she was named Woman of the Year. Yes, I mean to write &#8220;GQ Men of the Year Awards&#8221; and not &#8220;The Fame Whores Of The Year Awards.&#8221; And yes, I mean to write &#8220;Woman of the Year&#8221; and not &#8220;Gutter Tramp of the Year.&#8221; If you&#8217;re wondering why GQ named Kim &#8220;Woman of the Year,&#8221; your question will be answered next month when GQ publishes highly artistic, black and white photographs of Kendall and Kylie Jenner dry scissoring while topless. Pimp Mama Kris really knows how to work a trade.
And I don&#8217;t know why those people in the background look so calm. That skirt is moments away from letting go and exploding, sending pieces of metal flying everywhere. They should be running for their lives!
