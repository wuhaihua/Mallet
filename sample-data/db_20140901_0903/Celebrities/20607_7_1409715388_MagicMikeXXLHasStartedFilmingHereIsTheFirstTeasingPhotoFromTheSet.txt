Magic Mike is BACK and this time, it's going MAGNUM. 
Magic Mike XXL started filming THIS WEEKEND and the photos will only be getting hotter.
That's right! Somewhere in the world, Channing Tatum and Matt Bomer are likely shirtless. *SIGH*
This time the familiar abs will be taking a road trip to a stripper convention for a strip off. 
YES. REALLY. 
Even though Steven Soderbergh isn't directing this time, he has signed on to be director of photography, camera operator, and film editor so he will be witnessing all the nekkid delciiousness. 
And we don't blame him onnneee bit! Let's just hope Steven pours a little ketchup on that meat for us! HA!
