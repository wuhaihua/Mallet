Even If This Turns Out To Be Fake, We Won’t Be Eating Ice Cream For A While! Bird Poop Inbound!! Even If This Turns Out To Be Fake, We Won’t Be Eating Ice Cream For A While! Bird Poop Inbound!! 
One of the greatest thrills in life is eating an ice-cream cone. 
And one of the worst "thrills" is getting pooped on by a bird! 
So what happens when you combine those two elements? Well, you're about to find out! 
A YouTube video was recently published that featured a woman on a San Francisco beach talking about the loveliness in her life while eating an ice-cream cone. But when a piece of bird poo falls in her ice-cream, the unaware woman takes a lick that had us dry-heaving!!
To make matters worse - she then got directly pooped on by the bird with amazing aim and started to, rightly so, freak the F out! 
Here's what the video's caption said:

We're not sure if this is karma, but we DO know that the person filming this woman should've warned her about her ice cream slash bird poop cone! Hopefully they're the one who gets pooped on next! 
Actually, we straight up hope this is fake. SO GROSS!
