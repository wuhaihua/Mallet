Kendall Jenner's Labor Day Fashions Has Us Wondering — Is She Taking After Kim?? Kendall Jenner's Labor Day Fashions Has Us Wondering — Is She Taking After Kim?? 
There’s no stopping Kendall Jenner!
While most took a chance to relax this Labor Day weekend, the supermodel and starlet’s style definitely didn’t, especially after already flashing her envious stems only a couple days before!
With her beloved Balenciaga in hand, Kendall stepped out in two separate ensems in NYC on Monday, first highlighting her slim figure in a black leather jacket and nearly painted on black jeans.
Black booties and her modeling portfolio completed her chic look, fit for any go-see (that's model speak for an interview with a client/designer)!
Though she did tone down her look later in the day, dressing in a nude tank and similarly skinny jeans.
Either way, she was definitely taking some cues from big sis Kim Kardashian! When she's not rocking her go-to crop top and pencil skirts, the hawt mama is ALL about the skintight denim!
So do U think she's taking after Kimmy???
