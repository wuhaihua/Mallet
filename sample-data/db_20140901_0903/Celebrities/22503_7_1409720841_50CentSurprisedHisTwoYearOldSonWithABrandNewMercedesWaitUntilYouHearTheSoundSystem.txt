He’s definitely the fun dad!
50 Cent made his way to Los Angeles over the weekend to surprise his son Sire on the little man’s second birthday, even though it’s not his birthday! Just kidding, it totally was!
“Lil 50” had been Patiently Waiting for his present, and dad pulled out all of the stops, giving “Lil 50” a miniature Mercedes ML450 SUV, just like his poppa’s! 
And the sound system was perfect for playing his Ryder Music, as you can see from the video (below)! 
The fun didn’t stop there though!
Fiddy also shared some pics of his baby boy in his racing gear! They’re Outta Control cute! 
Sire’s even showed off his smizes while in the Winners Circle!
We have at least 21 Questions about how fab the party was, but we’re still just gushing over their father-son moment!
