These two are so in love and, apparently, they have an AH-MAZING sex life too! 
Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed have been proving just how head-over-heels they are by showing some major PDA, moving in together already, and buying a horse together! 
But THIS is the most scandalous move of them all! 
The couple paid a visit to the Seduction Love Boutique while in Canada together and dropped almost a THOUSAND dollars on sex toys! 
What exactly did they buy?
Well, apparently on the list were some vibrators, handcuffs, and restraints! $860 worth, to be exact!
Looks like they were planning for some 50 Shades of Grey fun later! 
The story gets even better, when apparently the employees didn't realize which famous hunk he was and asked him if he was Zac Efron! LOLz! 
He reportedly laughed and answered:

These two, man! So in love AND so exotic in the bedroom! 
Match made in heaven, clearly!
