So much for a relaxing getaway!
Celebrity chef Todd English was pulled over around 3:30am near Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in the Hamptons on Sunday, when he drifted out of his lane and looked “lost.”
With his new girlfriend in the passenger seat, English admitted to having a couple of glasses of wine during the night, but wouldn’t take a Breathalyzer test. 
So, he was charged with misdemeanor DWI as well as making an improper turn, but was released on $1,500 bail after his arraignment the next morning. 
A source said the 54-year-old scandalous chef had “been celebrating his birthday since Thursday,” and he didn’t just have a few drinks at dinner! Other sources say that after Sienna restaurant he went next door to the nightclub Finale East, where he continued drinking.
However, the birthday boy’s lawyer says that they’re looking forward to proving Todd is innocent in court. 
Drinking and driving is just the worst! Even if he was somehow sober, hopefully this is a reminder of how dangerous it can be.
