Angelina Jolie's Ex Lover Jenny Shimizu Is Getting Married Soon! Angelina Jolie's Ex Lover Jenny Shimizu Is Getting Married Soon! 
Ah, what could've been! 
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just seemingly had one of the best weddings in recent memory, and now it turns out that one of Angelina's former flames is also on her way down the aisle!
Actress slash model Jenny Shimizu will be marrying her girlfriend Michelle Harper at some point in the future and announced the news on Instagram with a pic of the two ladies in a bridal photo shoot for the June issue of Vogue. 
Jenny and Angelina had originally met during the filming of the movie Foxfire, and the two were mad about each other! 
Angelina Jolie even admitted that she probably would've married Jenny if her first hubby Johnny Lee Miller hadn't scooped her up first!
Here's what Angelina told Girlfriends magazine in 1997:

Well, the two have embarked on different paths since then, but we bet the two will definitely exchange wedding presents. 
If not now then somewhere down the line! 
We can't imagine these two don't stay in touch after such a seemingly passionate affair. 
If they don't - that'd be such a shame!
