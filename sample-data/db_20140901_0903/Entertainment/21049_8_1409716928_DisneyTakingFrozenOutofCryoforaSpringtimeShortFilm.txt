Winter is coming again! No, not that winter, you Game of Thrones sickos — the Frozen gang is getting back together for an animated short that will debut next year.
Walt Disney Animation Studios' Frozen Fever will feature Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, the bowling pin-shaped Olaf and — perhaps the most exciting news for parents of young children — an all-new Frozen song.

Frozen directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck are returning for the short, while "Let It Go" (which you may have heard by now) songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez are back to write the tune. In a nutshell, according to Disney: 
It's Anna's birthday and Elsa and Kristoff are determined to give her the best celebration ever, but Elsa's icy powers may put more than just the party at risk.
The studio said it will debut Frozen Fever in spring 2015, but didn't say when or where. It would make sense to debut the short before the studio's next film, Big Hero 6, but that comes out in November, so that's unlikely. However, big Disney does have the live-action Cinderella coming out in March.
Could there be a chill blowing over the little glass slipper? We'll find out in a matter of months.
