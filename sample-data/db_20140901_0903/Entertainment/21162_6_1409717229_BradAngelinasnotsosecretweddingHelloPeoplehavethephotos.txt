Brad-Angelina's not-so-secret wedding: Hello, People have the photos Brad-Angelina's not-so-secret wedding: Hello, People have the photos 
					So the Brangelina wedding turned out to be not so secret after all! Unless of course you can consider Hello! Magazine and People&nbsp;as&nbsp;good as family to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The magazines have now published the first photos of the much-hyped, much-talked about and apparently very secret France wedding of the Hollywood star couple.Both the magazines have declared that their photos are 'exclusive' and both have put the wedding pictures on their cover.In the People cover, we can see a Angelina Jolie looking all demure and predictably stunning in a simple and elegant white gown. However, what catches your eye is the veil, which is a lovely gauzy thing with colourful motifs that look&nbsp;like drawings made by children.The magazine goes on to confirm your suspicion.&nbsp;People  magazine says, "Luigi Massi, the master tailor at Atelier Versace, sewed dozens of designs from Jolie's children's drawings into the dress and veil."If you want a better look at these drawings, we suggest that you look at the Hello cover which shows Angelina's veil and the back of her dress where you can spot the drawings in their full glory.&nbsp;While it does look pretty by itself, you have to give Angelia brownie points for making it look gorgeous.The Hello cover also has a picture of Brad and Angelina kissing, while the People cover also has a picture of the couple sitting with their brood of six kids.According to People,&nbsp; the wedding was planned by Brad and Angelina's kids and was attended by just 20 people. The kids also helped write their parents' vows, adds the report.Pitt reportedly forgot to pack his tie and had to borrow one from one of his sons.The couple had got married on 23 August in a private ceremony in Chateau Miraval, which is a private vineyard estate owned by the couple. According to a spokesman for the couple, Jolie walked down the aisle with her eldest sons Maddox and Pax, while daughters Zahara and Vivienne threw flower petals. Shiloh and Knox served as ring bearers.
