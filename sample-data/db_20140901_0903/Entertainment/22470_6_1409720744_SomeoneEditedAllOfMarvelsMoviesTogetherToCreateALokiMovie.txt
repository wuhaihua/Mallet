Someone Edited All Of Marvel's Movies Together To Create A Loki Movie Someone Edited All Of Marvel's Movies Together To Create A Loki Movie The Marvel Cinematic Universe is filled with a bevy of brilliant characters, from the amazing Iron Man through to the mighty Thor, but there&#8217;s one character that isn&#8217;t getting his own movie who truly should: Thor&#8217;s brother, Loki. He took a starring role in The Avengers as the villain leading the attack on Earth, and paid the price in Thor: The Dark World, but some hardcore Loki fans wanted more. Enter Loki: Brother Of Thor, a fan cut of Loki&#8217;s journey through the Cinematic Universe so far.
The creator has cobbled together scenes from Thor, The Avengers, and Thor: The Dark World (in that order), as well as featurettes and deleted scenes to tie the three together and create one two-hour film with Loki as the starring character. There&#8217;s even a clip from Guardians Of The Galaxy in there.
I don&#8217;t imagine this will stay online for long, considering it&#8217;s a Blu-ray rip of three films just sitting on Vimeo, so watch it while you can!
