Relativity CEO Says Appointment Of Lawyer As Managing Director Will Help IPO Plans Relativity CEO Says Appointment Of Lawyer As Managing Director Will Help IPO Plans She&rsquo;s known as a tough-as-nails litigator. But does Carol Genis have the skills to run Relativity Media&rsquo;s&nbsp;day-to-day legal, business, and financial affairs &mdash; and possibly&nbsp;persuade&nbsp;investors that the independent studio might be a safe place to sink their cash? Genis will&nbsp;have a chance to prove what she can do now that Relativity has named her&nbsp;Managing Director, a new position where she&rsquo;ll report to CEO Ryan Kavanaugh and President Tucker Tooley. Relativity declined to identify her direct reports and/or&nbsp;her corporate peers, except to say that they will be &ldquo;other senior executives in the company.&rdquo;

				With the appointment, Genis left E&amp;L Gates, the Chicago-based law firm where&nbsp;she worked for the last 20+ years and represented Relativity in multiple cases.&nbsp;Kavanaugh says that her &ldquo;experience and insight will prove vital as we prepare for an IPO.&rdquo;Genis was part of the legal team that successfully defended Relativity this year from&nbsp;a defamation suit by a Native American group against the film Out Of The Furnace, which starred Christian Bale. In 2012 Genis fired a tough letter to The New Yorker calling&nbsp;Connie Bruck&rsquo;s profile of Kavanaugh &ldquo;false and malicious.&rdquo; The previous year, Genis blasted&nbsp;lawyer Bert Fields when he represented The Weinstein Co in a dispute over&nbsp;whether Relativity was obligated to distribute The Crow.
