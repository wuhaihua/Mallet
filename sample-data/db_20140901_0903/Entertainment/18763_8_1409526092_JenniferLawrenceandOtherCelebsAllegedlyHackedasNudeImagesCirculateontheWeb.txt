Jennifer Lawrence and Other Celebs Allegedly Hacked as Nude Images Circulate on the Web Jennifer Lawrence and Other Celebs Allegedly Hacked as Nude Images Circulate on the Web Image: Arthur Mola, Invision/Associated Press

A major trove of celebrity images, some including images alleged to be actress Jennifer Lawrence nude, began spreading all over the web and Twitter on Sunday evening. 
Early word of the images began spreading on 4Chan earlier in the day, where posters claimed that the images were the result of a hacker intrusion on a number of iCloud accounts and that the images included nude celebrities such as Victoria Justice, Emily Browning, Kate Bosworth, Jenny McCarthy and Kate Upton. 
However, at least one of the alleged victims of the hack has taken to Twitter to dispute the authenticity of the images. Justice wrote via Twitter: "These so called nudes of me are FAKE people. Let me nip this in the bud right now. *pun intended*"

These so called nudes of me are FAKE people. Let me nip this in the bud right now. *pun intended*

When contacted by Mashable, a spokesperson for Jennifer Lawrence issued the following statement:
This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Contrary to the Twitter message from Justice, the above statement from Lawrence's spokesperson alone appears to confirm the authenticity of at least some of the images being circulated.
Apple didn't not offer an official response when contacted by Mashable for comment on the incident.
