How Game Of Thrones Crafted Last Season's Emmy-Winning Visual Effects How Game Of Thrones Crafted Last Season's Emmy-Winning Visual Effects Game of Thrones walked away from the Emmys last week with four of the biggest technical awards, including a very well-deserved win for best visual effects. One team responsible has posted some of their process videos from season 4. Let&#8217;s just say it looks tougher than conquering the walled city of Meereen.

Montreal-based Rodeo FX posted this video as well as a deeper explanation of their work, which is a delicate blend of live-action and CG artistry. In mounting one of the most difficult scenes &#8212; the attack of the Wildlings &#8212; the artists had to duplicate a human cavalry in an actual forest many times over without disturbing the real-life cinematic details.
The key was creating several types of simulations to teach the computer-generated army how to behave: &#8220;CG cavalry was created with cloth sims, hair sims and proprietary crowd simulation tools. Particle and fluid simulations were also created to generate necessary interactivity between the snow and stampeding army.&#8221; The jaw-dropping results &#8212; along with scores of other memorable scenes &#8212; are nothing less than filmmaking magic.
