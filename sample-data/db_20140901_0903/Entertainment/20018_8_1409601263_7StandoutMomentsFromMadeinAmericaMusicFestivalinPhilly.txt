PHILADELPHIA â€” Through rain and shine, the east coast segment of the bi-coastal Made in America music festival delivered many memorable moments over Labor Day weekend. 
Some moments left attendees spellbound in dance fervor, inspired by monologues from artists and surprisingly silent during poignant artistry that broached hot topics such as Ferguson, celebrity culture and female empowerment.

In chronological order of the major nighttime acts, here are our seven standouts:
1. J. Cole opens with police-brutality videos
 
Rapper J. Cole started his show with a video montage of police-brutality clips set to "Be Free," the song he recorded after the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 
The tribute was a somber yet timely opening that hushed the usually rowdy Made in America crowd. It served as a reminder that music at fun events like festivals can keep important conversations going amid the good times. 

2. Steve Aoki hurls cake, ignites champagne showers

He began the delicious mayhem in Philly on Saturday before doing it all over again Sunday in Los Angeles for the west coast part of bi-coastal festival.

The $2 bills have a history in the music industry. Sightings of the uncommon paper money can be attributed to one wealthy lawyer: Mr. Steven Reisman, a human $2 bill dispensary for the stars in the hip-hop and rap world.
Nicknamed "The Two Dollar Bill Man," Reisman and his bills are now connected to such celebs as Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Michael Strahan, Justin Bieber and Big Sean.
4. Kanye lectures about love, hate and Kimye

The 37-year-old rapper gave a rousing 5-minute autotuned speech midway through "Runaway" that touched on many subjects such as hateful criticism from media, his vision of love as well as his marriage to Kim Kardashian. 
"For me to be in a very publicized interracial relationship is not a joke," Kanye said. "It's something that should be treated with respect because we're all in this together."
5. Spoon survived a mid-set weather delay

Fans were forced to evacuate the premises as organizers feared for their safety. An hour later, Spoon re-emerged onstage to finish as the rain continued to pour sans the lightning. 
The heavy rain seemed to awaken the crowd, with some fans dancing wildy while others closed their eyes, tilted their heads back and listened to the music with the added beat of raindrops.
6. Pharrell urges more women to shine

He closed the message thus: "I want to see some more female world leaders, I want to see some more female co-writers, I want to see some more female doctors, I want to see some more female artists. Let's do the anthem for the girls." This segued into "Hollaback Girl."
7. Kings of Leon's drummer closes with broken ribs

Though still sore, Followill warned Mashable prior to his set that he may cry at Made in America, but he instead winked at the cameras and soldiered through, captivating the crowd with "Use Somebody" and other hits. The Kings' red, white and blue lighting also evoked a perfectly patriotic Labor Day vibe.
