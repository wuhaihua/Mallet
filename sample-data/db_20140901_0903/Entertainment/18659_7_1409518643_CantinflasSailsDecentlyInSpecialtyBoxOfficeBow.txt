				In 2013,&nbsp;Pantelion began a record-breaking run with Instructions Not Included, the highest grossing Spanish-language film ever in the U.S. This year, it hopes to replicate that success with&nbsp;a similar release blueprint for biopic&nbsp;Cantinflas, which opened in 382 theaters Friday, grossing $2.625 million, and averaging $6,827. The estimated 4-day weekend cume is&nbsp;$3.275 million.The results so far give Cantinflas&nbsp;the edge when compared to other newcomers&nbsp;this weekend, but it&rsquo;s well behind last year&rsquo;s Instructions&nbsp;debut.&nbsp;That film&nbsp;opened the holiday weekend&nbsp;in 347 theaters, grossing $10 million for a very robust $28,818 PTA. It went on to cume $44 million. Cantinflas&nbsp;has a lot of work to do if it hopes to follow suit.Still, Cantinflas has the second-highest PTA of any film currently in release and certainly the highest of any feature running beyond a limited release (SPC&rsquo;s 2nd-week holdover Love Is Strange is highest so far) and Saturday&rsquo;s numbers were 8% higher than Friday.Pantelion is targeting primarily Latino audiences in the U.S. for the feature about Cantinflas, the Mexican actor best known in the States&nbsp;for co-starring with David Niven and Finlay Currie in&nbsp;Around The World In 80 Days, which won Best Picture and four other Oscars. Pantelion has marketed primarily&nbsp;via Spanish-language media outlets such as&nbsp;Televisa and Univision and by partnering with companies that cater to Latino clientele.&ldquo;We are doing grass-roots marketing, partnering with supermarkets that cater to Latin American [clientele],&rdquo; said Pantelion&rsquo;s Edward Allen. &ldquo;In L.A. we&rsquo;re doing an outdoor campaign, but also saturating Spanish-language media across all channels.&rdquo;Allen said the film&rsquo;s release pattern &ldquo;will mirror the Latino population across the country [and] we will expand based on performance and adjust the plan accordingly.&rdquo;Tribeca Film&rsquo;s critically praised British drama Starred Up, starring Jack O&rsquo;Connell, scored this weekend&rsquo;s second-highest average among newcomers, grossing $11K in two theaters ($5,500 PTA). It opened at IFC Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center in a day-and-date release.Starred Up&nbsp;premiered Tuesday at MoMA and opened the Film Society of Lincoln Center and IFC Center on Wednesday. Director David Mackenzie did Q&amp;As Wednesday and Thursday last week. Tribeca Film will expand the title Sept. 5 and again Sept. 12, with additional markets added throughout next month.Samuel Goldwyn Films opened The Last Days Of Robin Hood in two theaters, grossing $9,577 for a $4,788 PTA. The company said it will expand the film into 75 new theaters across the country&nbsp;Sept.&nbsp;5.In other openers, Roadside and Lionsgate bowed Daniel Schechter&lsquo;s Life Of Crime in 33 theaters. The film &ndash; which stars Jennifer Aniston, Yasmin Bey, Isla Fisher and Will Forte &ndash;&nbsp;grossed $99,500 for a $3,015 PTA. It will add an additional 20 markets Sept.&nbsp;12.And Sony Pictures Classics opened Hungarian drama The Notebook in a pair of locations. The film, which was short-listed for 2013&rsquo;s&nbsp;best&nbsp;foreign-language film Oscar, grossed $3,154 for a $1,577 average. The companies behind&nbsp;other debuts&nbsp;Last Weekend&nbsp;and&nbsp;Canopy&nbsp;did not report grosses.SPC had much stronger numbers for Ira Sachs&lsquo; Sundance &rsquo;14 premiere Love Is Strange in its second-week expansion. The distributor added 22 theaters in the New York drama&rsquo;s second frame, grossing over $261K for a solid $9,691 PTA.The title grossed over $126K last week in 5 theaters, averaging a strong $25,310 last week. It will add additional markets in the coming weeks.RADiUS-TWC added 41 runs for The One I Love, which has been available on VOD since Aug.&nbsp;1. It grossed $87,492 in 49 theaters, averaging $1,786. RADiUS previously said the film also&nbsp;has grossed more than $500,000&nbsp;in the first three weeks of its VOD run.SPC&rsquo;s Woody Allen release Magic In The Moonlight passed the $8 million cume threshold in its sixth week. The feature has grossed more than&nbsp;$824K from 438 runs so far this weekend. With far fewer theaters than last weekend, when it grossed $1.33 million in 787 theaters, it pulled in considerably less.Open Road&rsquo;s box-office star Chef easily passed $30M this weekend, grossing over $664K in 757 theaters ($877 PTA) for a cume just over $30.24 million.And IFC Films&rsquo; Boyhood is maturing as it passes&nbsp;the $18.5 million cume level after grossing $1.5 million&nbsp;Friday to Sunday.
