Telluride: Fest Closes As ‘Birdman’ , ‘Imitation Game’, ‘Foxcatcher’, ’99 Homes’ Stake Out Oscar Territory Telluride: Fest Closes As ‘Birdman’ , ‘Imitation Game’, ‘Foxcatcher’, ’99 Homes’ Stake Out Oscar Territory In our conversation about his new film,&nbsp;Birdman on Sunday after its triumphant North American premiere at Telluride the night before,&nbsp;I told director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu that I never thought I would see the day when we would be talking about this creator of oh-so-heavy dramas like&nbsp;Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams&nbsp; and&nbsp;Biutiful &nbsp;&nbsp;becoming a front runner to win a Golden Globe for&nbsp;Comedy. &ldquo;I have to laugh about that. &nbsp;The intensity to do a drama is strong and when I hit 50 last year I really thought I should lighten up a little bit. I have been doing some personal stuff that I thought would get me to a very nice place and understand a lot of things that before I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; &nbsp; he said about the decision to do&nbsp;Birdman.&nbsp;And he continued to challenge himself by shooting it with the illusion that it is one shot throughout. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a device , but I must say it works perfectly for what is a madcap comedy for much of its running time. &nbsp;It really is not only a great directorial achievement , but also a great actors showcase with surefire nominations in store for star Michael Keaton , back in top form , and possible nods for the supporting cast , in particular &nbsp;Edward Norton and Emma Stone. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a cinch for a SAG Cast nomination. &nbsp;This is actors nirvana and while it may not have played with quite the same euphoria as it reportedly did in its World Premiere in Venice, it was a big hit at Telluride too this weekend. &nbsp;Those who loved it&nbsp;really&nbsp;loved it. &nbsp; Awards attention is a given as my colleague Nancy Tartaglione suggested in Venice. &nbsp;The bigger question, a question for most show biz -oriented movies, is if it will be a little too inside baseball for mass audiences. &nbsp;But &nbsp;Inarritu swears he was just setting out to challenge himself and make a much smaller film. &nbsp;&ldquo;From now on I just want to defend my right to fail and in a way go on the journey to discover things and liberate myself of the control of my comfortable side. It&rsquo;s liberating when you lose yourself and go after something you know terrifies you, but the experience was so good here. Beyond the results, &nbsp;beyond whether it&rsquo;s good or not, the experience is much more&nbsp;alive, &rdquo; &nbsp; he said.

				Inarritu flew directly from Venice to Telluride but will be skipping the Toronto Film Festival and going on to close the New York Film Fest, a very appropiate stop for this almost indescribable film &nbsp;set on The Great White Way. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s going to miss almost all of the awards season as he will be making what he calls a &ldquo;pre-western&rdquo; &nbsp; in a movie for New Regency again , The Revenant&nbsp;on a long shoot thru March.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one half of a very good Telluride for Fox Searchlight looking for a second Best Picture winner in a row after last year&rsquo;s collaboration &ndash; also with New Regency &ndash; &nbsp;on&nbsp;12 Years A Slave. &nbsp;Searchlight also brought along Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern drawing Oscar buzz &nbsp;in Jean -Marc Vallee&rsquo;s&nbsp;Wild ,&nbsp; another film warmly received here in the perfect place to play it. Dern was in another Telluride choice too,&nbsp;99 Homes.Open Road launched Jon Stewart&rsquo;s writing and directing feature debut ,&nbsp;Rosewater&nbsp; and it become the only film of the festival to repeatedly receive (deserving) standing ovations. Telluride newbie Stewart has made a winning film that clearly overcame a handful of negative reviews that appeared just before the film premiered Friday night. Not sure what film those early critics were watching, and neither was Stewart as he told me Sunday when he was in a very good mood after one strong screening after another.The Weinstein Company had a very good Telluride too with their World Premiere of&nbsp;The Imitation Game&nbsp;starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, another surefire Oscar nominee for the company which won Best Picture Oscars &nbsp;for&nbsp;12 Years A Slave&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Artist&nbsp;after bringing them to Telluride and launching their release the week before Thanksgiving. &nbsp;It was hard to find anyone who didn&rsquo;t have &nbsp;nice, sometimes rapturous &nbsp;things to say about this film, so consider it launched &nbsp;&ndash; and headed to Toronto. My rival Oscar consultant grew so frutstrated trying to get into one of the many Imitation Game&nbsp; screenings they just gave up.&nbsp;TWC&rsquo;s &nbsp;Radius division&rsquo;s&nbsp;Escobar: Paradise Lost&nbsp;, a sneak preview that starred Benecio Del Toro &nbsp;and Josh Hutcherson got a bit of traction but seemed &nbsp;a more commercial play than anything else. Quincy Jones introduced Radius&rsquo; Oscar-hoping musical documentary ,&nbsp;Keep On Keepin&rsquo; On&nbsp;which also played well here.Not yet with an American distribution deal, Ramin Bahrani&rsquo;s&nbsp; 99 Homes&nbsp; is sure to get one , and likely will be thrust as a late contender in the Oscar race after running the trifecta of Venice, Telluride and Toronto ( I am told Toronto is where they will make a deal). &nbsp;Its dazzling &nbsp;performances from Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, not to mention Laura Dern and Tim Guinee &nbsp;are worth the price of admission. &nbsp;Also looking for a deal was the charming french comedy,&nbsp;The Price Of Fame ,&nbsp;loosely based on true events surrounding the theft of Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s coffin shortly after his burial in 1977. &nbsp;It looked like a perfect kind of Sony Pictures Classics movie to me , and turned out to be one of Telluride&rsquo;s sweet spots this year.Speaking of Sony &nbsp;Pictures Classics, &nbsp;Michael Barker and Tom Bernard continued the large show of strength they displayed in Cannes by bringing a record number of &nbsp;7 films to Telluride including &nbsp;Bennett Miller&rsquo;s chilling&nbsp;Foxcatcher,&nbsp;another strong Best Picture contender seen in the Rockies , just like&nbsp;Imitation Game&nbsp; and&nbsp;Birdman. &nbsp;Steve Carell told me at the beginning of the fest that he was very curious how this American horror story revolving around creepy John DuPont would play now it finally actually got to this country.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s dark , but most I spoke with had praise. &nbsp;SPC &nbsp;also brought along&nbsp;Mr. Turner &nbsp;,&nbsp;Argentina&rsquo;s&nbsp;Wild Tales (wildly loved) and the terrific Russian hockey documentary,&nbsp;Red Army &nbsp;from its Cannes slate. &nbsp;Plus &nbsp;the Russian foreign language hopeful, Leviathan , &nbsp; also from Cannes which continues to be the one festival that feels everyone else. &nbsp;Even Cannes topper Thierry Fremaux &nbsp;was in Telluride this year, adding &nbsp;to the strong influence from that festival of festivals. &nbsp;SPC&nbsp;threw their annual dinner Saturday night at La Marmott, drawing a bigger crowd than ever including&nbsp;Foxcatcher&nbsp; stars Carell and Channing Tatum in addition to Miller.Wm Wenders was there too with his new docu for SPC, &nbsp;The Salt Of The Earth.&nbsp;And they also brought yet another docu,&nbsp; Merchants Of Doubt. &nbsp;&nbsp;Based on their presence in Cannes, Telluride and later this week in Toronto , SPC is really seeming to be turning up the heat this awards season. In addition to SPC, &nbsp;Searchlight, IFC and the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences also threw their annual bashes here. &nbsp;AMPAS&rsquo; &nbsp;newly re-elected President Cheryl Boone Isaacs was among those making the trek . Their party also proved just how important Telluride has become to awards seasons. &nbsp;The town was teeming with Oscar voters soaking up the movies in the best possible way for them to be seen.Roadside Attractions brought its Cannes &nbsp;pick -up (with Saban Films)&nbsp;The Homesman&nbsp;and stars Hilary Swank (who also got a tribute) &nbsp;and Tommy Lee Jones made the scene. &nbsp;They (partnered with Black Label Media) &nbsp;also had one of the fest&rsquo;s &nbsp;most talked about and lauded films in&nbsp;&rsquo;71,&nbsp;set during the Catholic vs Protestant violence in Belfast and opens in late January I am told. It features a remarkable feature directorial debut from &nbsp;Yann Demange. And Cannes winner&nbsp;Mommy&nbsp;from Xavier Dolan made its North American debut in Colorado , rather than waiting a week for native Canada, proving that TIFF&rsquo;s attempt to derail Telluride of high level titles didn&rsquo;t have a great impact. &nbsp;IFC &nbsp;took time away from its Boyhood&nbsp;campaign to import from Cannes the Dardenne Brothers&rsquo;&nbsp;Two Days, One Night starring Marion Cottilard &nbsp;as well as the charming documentary from actor Ethan Hawke (who flew in for a couple of days) about a piano maestro and teacher in&nbsp;Seymour: &nbsp;An Introduction (going out thru Sundance Selects).&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly missed Telluride regular Jason Reitman whose new film bypassed the fest in favor of a World Premiere for Paramount&rsquo;s&nbsp;Men,Women and Children&nbsp; at TIFF. &nbsp;The major studios in fact were AWOL at Telluride &nbsp;this year, save for the specialty divisions of Fox and Sony but the quality of films and special presentations such as Francis Coppola&rsquo;s 35th anniversary doings for&nbsp;Apocalypse Now &nbsp;made this a memorable late summer cinematic clambake, if not one featuring perhaps the same number of major titles as in the recent past.Now it&rsquo;s on to Toronto. No rest for the bleary (eyed).&nbsp;
