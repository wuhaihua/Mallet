If you don&#8217;t have a capo for your guitar &#8212; or if you just forgot to bring one to your jam session &#8212; you can quickly put one together with just a pencil and a couple of rubber bands.

If you&#8217;re in a pinch and the song you want to play calls for a capo, YouTuber Samantha Fajardo shows how easy it is to make one with two fairly common household items.
Lay the pencil over the fret you need it on, put the top pencil end through the rubber band, stretch it around the back, and put the bottom pencil end through the rubber band. Add as many additional rubber bands you need to make sure it&#8217;s tightly attached, and you&#8217;re all set. Whether you&#8217;re laying down some lyrics or just writing down some chords, it&#8217;s good to have a pencil around when you&#8217;re playing guitar.
