Groom Arrested On Wedding Night After Groping Pregnant Waitress Groom Arrested On Wedding Night After Groping Pregnant Waitress 						
	A wedding night ended in flashing lights when three men were arrested early Monday morning in Pittsburgh when a brawl erupted after a newlywed groom continuously groped a pregnant bartender at his wedding reception.
The party was aboard the Pittsburgh cruise &#8220;Gateway Clipper&#8221; when Mark Williams, 33, harassed the server by being &#8220;touchy feely&#8221; with her and trying to pour alcohol down her throat, even though she told him she was pregnant.
She called her boyfriend Tyler Smith, 20, to pick her up when the boat docked around 1 a.m. Smith confronted the groom, and by the time the police showed up the two men were covered in blood.
Then the groom&#8217;s brother got involved and became aggressive with the officers, which is when a fourth party member punched his hand through the passenger window of a nearby car. While police were arresting him, he resisted and shouted out that he was HIV positive. Turns out, he is also a member of the local school board in Stowe County.
The three members of the wedding party were escorted to theÂ Allegheny County Jail.
