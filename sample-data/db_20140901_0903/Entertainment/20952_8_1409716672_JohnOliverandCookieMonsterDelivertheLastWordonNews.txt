This project is in support of Sesame Street's Words Are Here, There and Everywhere, a fantastic digital resource that encourages families to explore the world of words all around them. This initiative was developed in partnership with PNC Grow Up Great.
Special thanks to the amazing Kate McKinnon (Saturday Night Live), Al Roker (The TODAY Show) and Nick Offerman (Parks &amp; Recreation) for being part of this special video. It would not have been possible without their generous time and extraordinary talent.
