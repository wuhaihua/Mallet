NBC’s Richard Engel: Military Commanders ‘Apoplectic’ Over Obama’s ‘No Strategy’ Remarks [VIDEO] NBC’s Richard Engel: Military Commanders ‘Apoplectic’ Over Obama’s ‘No Strategy’ Remarks [VIDEO] NBC News&#8217; chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel claimed military commanders are &#8220;apoplectic&#8221; over President Barack Obama&#8217;s dithering on ISIS and admission that &#8220;we don&#8217;t have a strategy yet&#8221; to deal with them.
Engel spoke Sunday on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet The Press,&#8221; where he was asked by Andrea Mitchell about the &#8220;president&#8217;s reluctance to take the fight against ISIS to Syria.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, I spoke to military commanders, I speak to former officials, and they are apoplectic,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The think that this is a clear and present danger. They think something needs to be done.&#8221;
&#8220;One official said that this was a Freudian slip,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That it shows how the United States does not have a policy to deal with Syria, even when you have ISIS &#8212; which has effectively become a terrorist army, roughly 20,000 strong, about half of them foreign fighters &#8212; and incredibly well-armed after two major weapons hauls.&#8221;
