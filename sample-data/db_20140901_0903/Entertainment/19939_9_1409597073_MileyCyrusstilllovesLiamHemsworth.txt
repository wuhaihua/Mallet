Miley Cyrus still loves Liam Hemsworth Miley Cyrus still loves Liam Hemsworth Miley Cyrus is speaking out again about her ex, Liam Hemsworth. In September 2013, the couple called off their engagement, but that does not mean she doesn't have feelings for him anymore.In an interview with Australia's Sunday Night, she says, "I think I'm speaking to women and it's not because I went through a breakup -- I love Liam and Liam loves me but it's about finding yourself and sometimes you have to separate yourself from everyone. "They may still love each other, but back in 2013, Miley told Barbara Walters that she was scared after the breakup."I was so scared of ever being alone, and I think, conquering that fear, this year, was actually bigger than any other transition that I had, this entire year. I don't ever want to have to need someone again, where you feel like, without them, you can't be yourself."Recently, Miley has been finding herself by focusing on raising youth homelessness awareness and money for her favored charity, My Friend's Place. Her date to the 2014 MTV VMAs was a homeless young man, Jesse Helt.She said on her Facebook that bringing attention to My Friend's Place is "just the beginning" for her.Watch Miley Cyrus give her time to Jesse Helt at the 2014 MTV VMAs:
