				Broadway&rsquo;s two other newcomers padded&nbsp;into town somewhat more quietly: A revival of Kenneth Lonergan&rsquo;s This Is Our Youth, starring Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson, played a full eight-performance week at the Cort, taking in $390,372 &mdash; a bit over half its gross potential &mdash; with tickets averaging $60.65. At the Longacre, You Can&rsquo;t Take It With You, headlined by James Earl Jones and Rose Byrne, also played a full week and did slightly better than half its gross potential, at $519,102 and a $65.47 average ticket price, according to figures released this afternoon by the trade group Broadway League.For the week ending Sunday, total box office was up slightly from the previous week, to $22.9 million from $22.8 million, and over the same week a year ago ($20.5 million). Motown The Musical showed the biggest week-over-week increase ($120,962, to $1.1 million), and Wicked&nbsp;had the biggest drop (down $87,040 to $1.7 million). But shed no tears for either show.&nbsp;
