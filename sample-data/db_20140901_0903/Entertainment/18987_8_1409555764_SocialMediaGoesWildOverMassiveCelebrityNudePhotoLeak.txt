A massive leak of what appears to be celebrities in compromising positions has seen the Internet go into overdrive.
On Sunday evening, a hacker posted photographs to 4Chan purporting to show dozens of stars naked or partially exposed. The images spread quickly across Twitter and other social media platforms.

The 'master list' released by the hacker includes some of the biggest names in the world such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, Kate Bosworth, Kim Kardashian, Scarlett Johansson, Selena Gomez, Rihanna and many more. 
Fans and critics took to Twitter to express their opinion about the leak, which is thought to be the result of an iCloud hack.
Many were distressed by the violation of privacy 

Just remember that somewhere, this poor woman is probably crying in her house, privacy compromised, devastated. #JenniferLawrence #justice

The beauty of the moment was noticed

Jen Lawrence is beautiful. The human body isn't anything to be ashamed about. It's pervs that leak private photos that should be ashamed.
