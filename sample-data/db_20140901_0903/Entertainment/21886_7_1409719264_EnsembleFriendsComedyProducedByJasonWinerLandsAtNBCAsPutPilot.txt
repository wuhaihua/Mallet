Ensemble Friends Comedy Produced By Jason Winer Lands At NBC As Put Pilot Ensemble Friends Comedy Produced By Jason Winer Lands At NBC As Put Pilot As we mark the 20-year anniversary of Friends&rsquo; debut this month, it is fitting that NBC has won the bidding for a new multi-camera comedy about a group of friends. The network has bought The One That Got Away, from creators Mike Lisbe and Nate Reger (How To Be A Gentleman) and producer Jason Winer, with a put pilot commitment. The project hails from 20th Century Fox TV, marking another high-profile pitch from the studio to land at a network other than Fox this season. The One That Got Away, whose title also is reminiscent of Friends&lsquo; episode monikers, which all started with &ldquo;The One&rdquo;, answers the question: What if you could have a second chance with the one person that got away? It tells the story of a woman who, 15 years after high school, moves to Miami and rejoins her old group of friends to try to spark a romance with her high school crush. Winer&rsquo;s Small Dog Picture Co is producing with 20th TV, where it is based. Lisbe and Reger executive produce alongside Small Dog&rsquo;s Winer and Renate Radford. This marks the second sale for Small Dog this season. The company also has The Sound Of The Sumners, a single-camera musical family comedy from writer Peter Knight, at Fox with a script commitment plus a significant penalty. The One That Got Away was packaged by ICM Partners which reps Winer, Lisbe and Reger.
