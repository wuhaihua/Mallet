Gabrielle Union, 41, tied the knot on Saturday night in Miami to Heat superstar Dwyane Wade and the bride looked absolutely stunning.

"Thank you thank you thank you @DennisBasso for helping me design THE most perfect gowns for the most special night of my life... So grateful... So happy," she posted on Instagram today with a shot of the bride in her Dennis Basso-designed white gown.

The actress also posted some relaxing photos from the "#WadeUnion" weekend, as she called it.

"Happy... Got my Luther playin... There's a #BeingMaryJane marathon on #BET, my #nebraska #huskers play today... All my loved ones are in town... Today is a good day... I must say I'm feeling blessed and humbled and just freakin happy... Let's go!!! #thewadeunion," she wrote on Saturday during the day.
 
 

Not to be outdone, she also shared a picture from Friday's rehearsal dinner with her and her man getting out of a hot Ferrari in South Beach.

"Let's gooooooo! #thewadeunion."
 
 

Wade proposed to Union last December.

"I was completely surprised," Union told "Live with Kelly and Michael" in January.
