Apple Says It’s Not Responsible For Theft Of Celebrity Nude Photos Apple Says It’s Not Responsible For Theft Of Celebrity Nude Photos Don&rsquo;t blame security flaws in Apple&rsquo;s&nbsp;iCloud for the theft and distribution this weekend of several nude photos of prominent actresses including&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Upton, the electronics company says. &nbsp;After a 40-hour investigation it concluded that the privacy violations came from a &ldquo;very targeted attack on user names, passwords, and security questions,&rdquo;&nbsp;Apple said today in a statement. &ldquo;None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple&rsquo;s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone.&rdquo; It advised people to &ldquo;always use a strong password and enable two-step verification.&rdquo; Apple added that it&rsquo;s working with law enforcement officials to help &ldquo;identify the criminals involved.&rdquo;&nbsp;The FBI says that it is &ldquo;aware of the allegations&hellip;and is addressing the matter.&rdquo; It declined to comment on Apple&rsquo;s statement.

				Apple&rsquo;s explanation didn&rsquo;t satisfy writer and software engineer David Auerbach. The company &ldquo;has had a known security vulnerability in its iCloud service for months and has been careless about protecting its users,&rdquo; he says on Slate. &ldquo;Apple patched this vulnerability shortly after the leak, so even if we&rsquo;re not sure of exactly how the photos got hacked, evidently Apple thinks it might have had something to do with it.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s &ldquo;reason enough for users to be deeply upset at their beloved company for not taking security seriously enough.&rdquo;The breach could hardly come at a worse time for Apple: It plans a press event on September 9 where it&rsquo;s expected to unveil new iPhones, its long-awaited iWatch, a mobile payments service, and possibly a wearable device that tracks users&rsquo; health. They&rsquo;ll be hard to sell if consumers fear that hackers can get at the private information.But investors appear unfazed. Apple&rsquo;s share price rose 0.8% today,&nbsp;a flat day for the overall market.
