All The Close-Up Shots Used In All Edgar Wright's Movies All The Close-Up Shots Used In All Edgar Wright's Movies 
Although we know funny movie maestro Edgar Wright uses a ginormous arsenal of visual tools and tricks when he&#8217;s directing a movie, one of his trademarks is his use of close up shots. They&#8217;re quick, they&#8217;re snappy, and they&#8217;re so fun to see on the screen. James R. Lloret stitched all of them together in this fun supercut.

The scenes are from:
Shaun of the Dead (2004)
Hot Fuzz (2007)
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)
The World&#8217;s End (2013)
