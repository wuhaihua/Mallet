Playlists are one of the key elements in making YouTube into the ultimate music streaming service. Speed that process up by using a search shortcut.
Google Operating System points out that if you click on the three-dot icon next to an individual title in YouTube&#8217;s search results, you can add that video to any of your existing playlists, or create a new one. If you&#8217;re confident it&#8217;s the right choice, that saves on actually previewing the video to add it. Simple but effective.
