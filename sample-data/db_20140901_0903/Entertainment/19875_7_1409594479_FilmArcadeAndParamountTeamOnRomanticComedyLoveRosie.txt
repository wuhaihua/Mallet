Film Arcade And Paramount Team On Romantic Comedy ‘Love, Rosie’ Film Arcade And Paramount Team On Romantic Comedy ‘Love, Rosie’ The Film Arcade and Paramount Home Media Distribution have acquired Contantin Film&rsquo;s romantic comedy Love, Rosie. Film Arcade will distribute the film theatrically in the U.S. with Paramount Home Media handling all other platforms domestically. Release dates are tentatively scheduled for early 2015. Based on P.S. I Love You author Cecelia Ahern&rsquo;s bestseller Where Rainbows End, Love, Rosie stars Lilly Collins and Sam Claflin as a pair of star-crossed lovers. The two have been best friends since they were 5, but are their own worst enemies when it comes to love, life and making the right choices. One awkward turn at 18, one missed opportunity, and life sends them hurtling in different directions. Pic begs the question, will they find their way back to one another or will it be too late?
