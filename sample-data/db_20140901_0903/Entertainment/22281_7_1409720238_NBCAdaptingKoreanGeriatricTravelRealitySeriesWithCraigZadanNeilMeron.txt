Craig Zadan and Neil Meron (The Sound of Music, Smash) will produce the project, which draws parallels to Berry White&rsquo;s Off Their Rockers that started on NBC. In Better Late Than Ever, four veteran actors go backpacking across Asian countries with a young guy who does chores for them along the way. The original series, which aired for two seasons on channel tvN, featured a group of 70- and 80-something guys backpacking though Europe. Here is an English-language trailer.
