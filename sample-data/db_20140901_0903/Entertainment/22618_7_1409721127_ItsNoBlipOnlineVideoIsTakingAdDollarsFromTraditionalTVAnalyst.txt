It’s No Blip, Online Video Is Taking Ad Dollars From Traditional TV: Analyst It’s No Blip, Online Video Is Taking Ad Dollars From Traditional TV: Analyst The debate is over, or should be, MoffettNathanson Research&rsquo;s Michael Nathanson says this morning: Advertisers are shifting spending to online video at the expense of traditional TV programming that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;essential&rdquo; &mdash; meaning live sports and events, hit scripted shows, and cable shows&nbsp;that appeal to hard-to-reach audiences. Even with a flood of political ads coming over the next few months, Nathanson just&nbsp;lowered his 2014 ad forecast for national broadcast TV to +2% from +5%, and for national cable to +5% from +6%.

				Many media CEOs dismissed the weak ad trends in the first half of this year, blaming the&nbsp;Winter Olympics in Q1 or the World Cup, which peaked in July during Q3. CBS chief Les Moonves, for one, said that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;now seeing pacing improve significantly here in Q3, both nationally and locally, and Q4 will be even better than Q3.&rdquo; The industry view is that traditional TV ad sales will pick up again as Nielsen improves its ability&nbsp;to measure online viewers. In June RBC&nbsp;Capital Markets&rsquo; David Bank also downplayed the digital threat, noting that only about 16% of the online video ad inventory accompanies content that would be suitable for a network TV advertiser.But Nathanson says that he was &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; to see&nbsp;that online accounted for 98% of the growth in total ad spending in Q2 vs the period last year. &ldquo;This is the largest contribution to growth since 2008 when online was growing in the face of a declining traditional ad market.&rdquo; Ad spending for broadcast TV fell 4.7% in Q2 which reveals &ldquo;the weak underlying non-sport advertising trends,&rdquo; he says. While cable networks were up 3.6%, &ldquo;only Disney ended up beating our estimates thanks in part to the strength of the World Cup on ESPN.&rdquo;

			Some of the recent weakness was due to Hollywood itself: Faced with anemic summer box office sales &ldquo;film studios have kept a tighter leash on marketing spend,&rdquo; the analyst says. The number of movie-related spots was down 10% in June and 24% in July, according to TiVo data.Still, Nathanson says that execs should expect &ldquo;a continued shift in TV [ad] budgets towards online video and display.&rdquo; For 2015&nbsp;&mdash; which won&rsquo;t have an Olympics or major elections &mdash; he expects total TV ad sales to fall 0.3% with local stations -5.0%, the Big 4 broadcast networks -3.0%, national cable nets +5.0%, local cable -1.0%, and syndication (which includes WB, CW, and MyNetwork TV) flat.
