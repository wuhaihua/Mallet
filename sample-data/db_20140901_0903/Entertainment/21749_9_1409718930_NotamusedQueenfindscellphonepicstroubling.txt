Not amused: Queen finds cell phone pics troubling Not amused: Queen finds cell phone pics troubling It's official. She is not amused.The U.S. ambassador to Britain has told Tatler magazine that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II finds the obsession with mobile phone images a bit disconcerting. The monarch expressed her dismay to Matthew Barzun, who spoke with her when presenting his credentials as America's representative.The magazine quoted Barzun as saying "she was essentially saying, 'I miss eye contact.'"Some members of the royal family have posed for selfies with the public. The queen's most famous brush with cell-phone images was at the Commonwealth Games this summer, when she accidentally "photo-bombed" -- popped up smiling in the background -- a selfie taken by an Australian athlete.Earlier this year, the 88-year-old monarch was spotted on the "Game of Thrones" set.Barzun was interviewed for Tatler's October issue.Both the embassy and the palace declined to comment Tuesday.
