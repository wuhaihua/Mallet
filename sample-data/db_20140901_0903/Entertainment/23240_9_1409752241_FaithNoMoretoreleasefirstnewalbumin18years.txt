Faith No More to release first new album in 18 years Faith No More to release first new album in 18 years Faith No More has big plans for 2015.The hard rock band will release its first new album in a whopping 18 years in April. Bassist Bill Gould told Rolling Stone the project is pretty far along and has been about a year and a half in the making. The guys have been holed up in a rehearsal space in Oakland, California, working on material for the upcoming independent release."We weren't touring, we have these songs that we were working on -- that we think are pretty cool -- and why don't we just do our own imprint and kind of reclaim our future, in a way? We own the future more than we ever have," he said. When asked about the sound, Gould said, "I think what we're doing reflects where we've gone since we made our last record as Faith No More. I think this kicks things up a notch. And I think there's parts that are very powerful and there's parts that have a lot of "space." Everything we do, with our chemistry, the way we play; it's always going to sound like us. It's just what we do, that makes us feel good."Faith No More's most recent effort, "Album of the Year," came out in 1997. A tour is being planned around the album's release.
