				The film will Premiere next year at the opening of Melco Crown&rsquo;s newest movie themed resort Studio City in Macau. It&rsquo;s the first time De Niro, Pitt and DiCaprio have worked with Martin Scorsese together in the same film. DiCaprio has done five with Scorsese, and De Niro eight, but none together until now. De Niro and DiCaprio did This Boy&rsquo;s Life together back in 1993, with Scorsese so impressed by the kid that he suggested to his pal Scorsese he oughta meet DiCaprio. The met and hit it off pretty good. Maybe this convergence with Pitt is a good warmup for that Frank Sinatra film Scorsese and DiCaprio have been talking about?
