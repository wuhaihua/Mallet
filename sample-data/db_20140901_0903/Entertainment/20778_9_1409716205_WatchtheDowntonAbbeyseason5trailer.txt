Watch the "Downton Abbey" season 5 trailer Watch the "Downton Abbey" season 5 trailer Things are heating up on the new season of "Downton Abbey."A fire is just one of the things that happen in a new trailer for the fifth season of the British period drama. There are also glimpses of guest star Richard E. Grant (who recently appeared on "Girls") and a potential new love interest for Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). And, naturally, it wouldn't be "Downton" without some one-liners from Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess and grumblings about the changing times from Mr. Carson (Jim Carter)."Downton is catching up with the times we live in," Mrs. Hughes tells the butler. "That," he counters, "is exactly what I am afraid of."The new season of "Downton Abbey" premieres Sept. 21 on Britain's ITV. Viewers in the U.S. will have to cover their ears and try to avoid spoilers until it arrives Jan. 4 on PBS.
