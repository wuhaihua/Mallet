Public Menace Justin Bieber Got Arrested Again Public Menace Justin Bieber Got Arrested Again &nbsp;&nbsp;						
	Justin Bieber &#8212; always the criminal, and never the innocent &#8212; was arrested (again) and charged Friday with assault and dangerous driving after a collision between an ATV and minivan in his home country, Canada.
Police reports say there was a physical altercation between the driver of the ATV and an occupant of the minivan. The report doesn&#8217;t state which vehicle Bieber was in, but he was seen driving a four-wheeler with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez Friday; however, he also seems like the type who gets chauffeured in a minivan, so it could go either way.

The 20-year-old public menace was taken into custody, released, and will face court later this month.
Keep in mind the Canadian pop star, who has spent more time in custody than in a recording studio lately, is on a two year probation from his Los Angeles egging case. (RELATED: Justin Bieber Is Not Going To Jail)
