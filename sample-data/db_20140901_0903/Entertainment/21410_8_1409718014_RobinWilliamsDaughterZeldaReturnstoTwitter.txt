Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Returns to Twitter Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Returns to Twitter 
Three weeks after Zelda Williams quit Twitter and said she was "deleting this from my devices for a good long time," the only daughter of the late Robin Williams is back.

                                        
                                        
                                    
                                            
                                            
                                        
                            
                        
                        
She tweeted Monday for the first time since Aug. 13 with a message of "Thank you," which came with a link to her Tumbler.

The Tumbler post has a quote from actor Harvey Fierstein, "Never be bullied into silence."

It continued, "Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself."

This return comes weeks after Williams left Twitter upon seeing some crude remarks from other members on social media regarding her father's suicide.

Those so-called Twitter trolls were suspended.

Zelda, 25, released a statement after Williams was found dead at 63 in an apparent suicide Aug. 11.

"To those he touched who are sending kind words, know that one of his favorite things in the world was to make you all laugh. As for those who are sending negativity, know that some small, giggling part of him is sending a flock of pigeons to your house to poop on your car. Right after you’ve had it washed," she said via a statement.
