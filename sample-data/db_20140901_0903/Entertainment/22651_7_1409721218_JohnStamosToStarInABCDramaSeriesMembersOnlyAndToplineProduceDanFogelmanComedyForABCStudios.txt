He has been tapped as the male lead of ABC&rsquo;s midseason drama series Members Only. Additionally, Stamos has teamed with ABC Studios-based comedy producer Dan Fogelman (The Neighbors) for a comedy series, which the ER and Full House alum will topline and executive produce. It is shaping up to be a very busy fall for Stamos who also is involved in a Full House reboot in development at Warner Bros. TV. I hear the project is being considered by Netflix.
