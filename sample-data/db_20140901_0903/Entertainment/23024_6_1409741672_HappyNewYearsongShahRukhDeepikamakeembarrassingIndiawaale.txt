'Happy New Year' song: Shah Rukh, Deepika make embarrassing 'India waale' 'Happy New Year' song: Shah Rukh, Deepika make embarrassing 'India waale' 
					Here's what Happy New Year was primarily meant to be: Shah Rukh Khan gifting Farah Khan back her career. This, after she made a film-shaped disaster called Joker whose only memorable bit was a gorgeous Katrina Kaif rubbing salt into the Tushar Kapoor world's wounds, saying, "I'm too sexy for you, main tere haath na aani".Khan, as&nbsp;we have seen in the trailer, went&nbsp;to great lengths for it - you must have seen how he even agreed to dye ten strands of his hair blonde at the risk of looking like he has gum stuck on his hair. But, hey, he is Shah Rukh Khan. And for people who are fond of him, these are really minor impediments to their process of appreciating Khan.However, to rake interest in the film, the producers have now come out with a video of its song 'Hum India waale'. If you're hunting for either logic or subtlety in a Farah Khan film, you should also probably take on other impossible tasks like finding two more non-Barbie Doll expressions&nbsp;on Sonam Kapoor's face. Because Farah Khan and logic are mutually exclusive and the beautiful thing is, both have managed to survive without each other.However, 'Hum Indian waale' is in a league above every, somewhat endearing, Farah Khan inanity.&nbsp;First of all, it talks about what hum Indian waale are like and makes you want to belong to whichever intellectual galaxy&nbsp;Nicki Minaj&nbsp;hails from instead. The video &nbsp;has men in velvet dinner jackets that even Daler Mehndi would have rejected in the '90s. Later in the video, the men slip into Alif Laila pants while Deepika Padukone is&nbsp;put in a red and gold wrapping paper.The set in which&nbsp;the song begins is straight out of Om Shanti Om&nbsp;and the choreography&nbsp;involves a lot of foot stomping. The latter can actually be excused as we realise the director was having to make Abhishek Bachchan and Sonu Sood dance.Actually, Bachchan, who seems to be in a Johnny Lever-state-of-being in the song, is one of the people that don't make you cringe while listening to the song. Imagine, if in a frame which has Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani and Bachchan, it's the last name that is a consolation of sorts, what film are we getting ourselves into?&nbsp;Watch the video here:
