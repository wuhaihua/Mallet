Monsters, Inc. As A Horror Movie Is Pretty Intense Monsters, Inc. As A Horror Movie Is Pretty Intense 
Monsters, Inc., one of my favourite Pixar movies, used the idea of monsters and scares and creepy creatures for laughs and a heartwarming story. This re-cut movie trailer by Ross Thompson paints the picture differently and re-cuts the scenes in the style of the Prometheus movie trailer. This is Monsters, Inc. the horror movie.

Though Prometheus might not be as beloved as Alien, one thing it had going for it was a fantastic movie trailer.
