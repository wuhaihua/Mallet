'Guardians' No. 1 With $280M Cume; 'As Above/So Below' Tops Newcomers 'Guardians' No. 1 With $280M Cume; 'As Above/So Below' Tops Newcomers 6th UPDATE, Monday, 8:17 AM: Guardians of the Galaxy will end the summer with over $280M domestically &mdash; and, of course, it&rsquo;s still playing. We expect this one to eventually pass $300M as there is nothing opening next weekend. This one will clock in with an estimated $22.4M to $23M for the weekend. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will log roughly $166.3M in only four weeks for Paramount. This one will also play through the next weekend. There is nothing up to challenge the family market until Alcon&rsquo;s Dolphin Tale 2 bows from Warner Bros. on Sept. 12.

				Of the newcomers, As Above, So Below opened to No. 5 over the four-day weekend with an estimated $10.3M, which should be good enough to make its budget and marketing and distribution costs back. Most of its audience was Hispanic &mdash; about 34% to clear. It has an outstanding marketing push on social media, driven by YouTube (see below for details) and Universal/Legendary launched a Hispanic media campaign leading up to release, with media buys on Univision, Unimas, Telemundo, Mun2, FoxD, Discovery en Espa&ntilde;ol, Univision Interactive, VEVO&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pandora. The November Man, which Relativity picked up for $3M, will end the four-day weekend with around $10.2M and a five-day total of anywhere between $11.7M and $11.9M. Pierce Brosnan who starred in this one also executive produced this one through his company Irish DreamTime along with Das Films. Looks like it was pre-sold.Which brings me to Cantinflas based on Mexican comedian/actor/singer/filmmaker (what didn&rsquo;t Mario Marino do?), which was in a moderate release from Lionsgate&rsquo;s Pantelion Films. My colleague Brian Brooks explained the grassroots effort that the label undertook to ensure its success here. This was the same label that marketed Instructions Not Included to become the highest-grossing Spanish-language ever in the U.S. last year. While it may not reach that height, it did produce the second-highest per screen average for any film in release (behind Sony Pictures&rsquo; classics&rsquo; Love is Strange which is its second frame and in fewer theaters). About $6,900 for the three-day and around $9,000 for the four-day. They did not cut a Spanish-language version of the film, but they didn&rsquo;t have to. It basically is: 90% of the scenes are in Spanish and only 10% in English. They have subtitles, of course, in both languages. With an A CinemaScore, this one is already getting positive word-of-mouth and there are hopes to get some buzz for Oscar. This one will rollout to international markets beginning on Sept. 19 in Mexico, Central America, Bolivia and Ecuador; the rest of Latin America will bow in October .

			The Pantelion guys have worked hard to grow this label. Every week, I usually try to give some kudos to an unsung hero of a movie. So this week, it will be these guys: First of all, I&rsquo;m told that the initial vision to form Pantelion to serve the Hispanic market in the U.S. was shared by Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer and Televisa CEO Emilio Azcarraga Jean. Pantelion CEO Paul Presburger, COO Edward Allen and Pantelion head of marketing Carol Sewell worked with Lionsgate&rsquo;s theatrical distribution team Richie Fay and David Spitz to roll this one out. There you go.In its second weekend, If I Stay &mdash; the film based on the YA adult novel &mdash; ends up with an estimated four-day total of $11.6M and a cume-to-date of $32.1M. The weekend-to-weekend drop was only 41% but Warner Bros. added about 100 theaters for this MGM-produced picture; it ended up in a respectable third place right under the two tentpoles. Let&rsquo;s Be Cops dove in under that to take No. 4 and is nearing $60M after the four-day for Fox. It ends the holiday with $10.5M and a total cume of $59.67M.When the Game Stands Tall from Sony will touchdown on the four-day with $7.8M to $8M to bring its two week cume to around $18.6M. This one held all its screens and dropped only 28% which is just great for the studio. Frank Miller&rsquo;s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For also held onto its screens &mdash; how, I have no idea (miracles do happen) &mdash; and slid 66% in its second weekend on TWC to make only $2.8M for the four day. The two-week total on this Robert Rodriguez/Aldamisa bomb is only $11.4M.In re-release, Begin Again added only another $1M, which ain&rsquo;t bad. It ain&rsquo;t good either, but it is what it is. The cume for the film, which has been in release for 10 weeks and added 296 theaters for the Labor Day holiday, is now at a cume of $15.6M. Jon Favreau&rsquo;s Chef was able to pass the $30M mark in its re-release which is what Open Road needed it to do. It sits nicely at $30.5M after the four-day. Ghostbusters, the classic comedy of my youth, played older (of course) and will gross an estimated $2.2M, depending on moviegoing today. The move was done to help the Blu-Ray special anniversary edition (remastered) on September 16th. The Top Ten chart is partially done, so here is the Top Six and the rest is on its way:1). Guardians of the Galaxy (DIS), 3,462 theaters (+91) / $3.8M Fri. / $6.2M Sat. (+62%) / $7M Sun. (+13%) / $5.9M Mon.

(-15%) / $2.6M Sun. (-6%) / $1.6M Mon. (-35%) / 3-day cume: $8.6M / 4-day cume: $10.3M / Wk 16). The November Man (REL), 2,776 theaters / $2.1M Friday / $2.7M Sat. (+27%) / $2.8M Sun. (+3%) / $2.2M Mon. (-25%) / 3-day cume: $7.8M / 4-day cume: $10M / Total cume: $11.65M (over 5 days) / Wk 15th UPDATE, Sunday, 8:12 AM: The summer is finishing up, overall down 14.7% through Sunday year to year and off an estimated 14.8% from 2013. Not surprising as not one picture this year opened to $100M nor did one film achieve the heights that Iron Man 3 did last year when it shot over $400M. There&rsquo;s one more day to go on the long Labor Day holiday and before the official summer end. The final numbers on box office will be known on Monday.We hope everyone is enjoying themselves on this last weekend, denoting the close of summer. Disney and Marvel certainly are as they have shot their way to the top of 2014 and the summer with the highest domestic grosser with Guardians of the Galaxy which should end the summer with a $279.4M domestic gross. It is also nearing $550M worldwide with $547.7M and still playing. Marvel&rsquo;s Alan Fine did his job well for choosing this gem which will, as I said before, should easily pass $300M. So, it was a one-two punch again with Paramount&rsquo;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the No. 2 spot.The movie based on the young adult novel If I Stay added screen and held better than if it had not for a drop of only 41% in its sophomore frame. It should end the three-day weekend with a cume of $32M on a budget of what Warner Bros. claims to be $11M. MGM produced this one. Of the newcomers, As Above/So Below (what a horrible title) &mdash; the first picture in Legendary&rsquo;s deal with Universal &mdash; garnered a lousy C- CinemaScore from its core audience but it&rsquo;s good enough to be in a horserace with Fox&rsquo;s R-rated comedy Let&rsquo;s Be Cops which is now in its third week of play and heading towards $60M. With an estimated $5M budget, this one should end up with around $10M after Labor Day so this should bring in a profit as this plays itself out. While the horror pic As Above/So Below will win over Let&rsquo;s Be Cops on the three-day, it&rsquo;ll likely lose to the comedy on the four-day. The horror film, according Rentrak/Screen Engine&rsquo;s PostTrak exit polling, 52% was female. Go figure.The November Man, which stars the Pierce Brosnan in an actioner (why, oh why, do we have so many aged men still running around shooting &lsquo;em up and dodging explosions?) will end up with around $7.5M to $7.7M for the three-day and $9.4M to $9.7M for the four-day. It sags to the No. 6 spot, however, distributor Relativity expects this one to continue to play because of its B+ CinemaScore 83% of its audience was over 25, according to PostTrak.&nbsp; Pictures that carry that score usually have a 3.2 multiple. Hmmm, we&rsquo;ll see.Nicely done was Cantinflas which will end the weekend with a strong per screen average of $6,872 for the three-day and $8,573 for the four-day &mdash; Lionsgate&rsquo;s Pantelion Films is enjoying the highest or second-highest per screen of any film in nationwide release. Okay, we checked after they announced that they had the highest and here here is Lionsgate/Pantelion&rsquo;s clarification: &ldquo;Love is Strange had higher per screen, but was only in 27 locations/7 markets. We had the highest screen average among all films in national release.&rdquo; Okaaaay. You see what kind of semantic ridiculousness box office reporters have to deal with? Oy!Meanwhile, Ghostbusters, released into the marketplace by Sony for its 30th anniversary, will end the four-day holiday weekend with $2M, by all accounts, or about a $2,550 per for the four-day. PostTrak&rsquo;s shows that 65% of the moviegoers were over 25 years-old and 60% were male &hellip; so, uh, maybe having an all-female cast for the next Ghostbusters will soothe the savage, chauvinistic beasts (some of whom I work with) who think women should not be cast in the re-make. I guess if they walk around in bikinis instead of hazmat suits all will be forgiven, right guys?Regarding other pictures in their second weekends of release &mdash; When the Game Stands Tall (SONY) and Frank Miller&rsquo;s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For &ndash; one held strong, the other melted like a snowball in hell. The Game, indeed stood its ground, ended down only 33% in its second quarter. It looks to go into the endzone with a little under $18M for a two-week cume, although the studio is expecting the full $18M. On a budget of a little under $20M (I heard $18M and change), this one has a way to go to become profitable yet but it&rsquo;s much better off than Sin City, with a budget of around $65M to $70M and after two weeks has only chased in $11.3M after the four-day holiday. Yikes.The last picture worth talking about is Chef from Open Road Films which was re-released this weekend and just stepped over the coveted $30M mark for filmmaker Jon Favreau. The distributor handled this one well, squeezing every last penny from it as it heads to home entertainment. Here&rsquo;s the Top Ten chart as it looks this AM with estimates through the weekend:Amanda N&rsquo;Duka contributed to this report.1).

Guardians of the Galaxy,&nbsp;Disney/Marvel&rsquo;s biggest domestic grosser of the summer and as of this weekend now also the highest domestic grosser 2014, is expected to take in about $6.1M today on track for an $16.5M three-day and a four-day of around $21.9M. In second position, is Paramount&rsquo;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with an estimated 4.5M take today which is good for about $11.8M to $12M for the weekend and approaching $16M for the long holiday.If I Stay, Warner Bros.&rsquo; sophomore frame player, about $3.89M on Saturday to keep its gross around $9.2M for the three-day and $11.4M to $11.9M for the four-day.The two top newcomers this weekend &mdash; the horror flick As Above/So Below and the Pierce Brosnan-actioner The November Man &ndash; both took in about $2.8M for the day as did Fox&rsquo;s R-rated comedy Let&rsquo;s Be Cops. So the 4th and 5th spots at the moment are a little murky as Let&rsquo;s Be Cops and As Above/So Below are close for four-day gross numbers with around $10.2M both. However, for the three-day the horror film is expected to end the three-day weekend with a total haul of about $8.5M to $8.8M compared to the Cops $8M. Relativity&rsquo;s November Man will come under that with $7.75M for the three-day and around $9.85M for the four-day.Cantinflas is still performing extremely well today and estimated dropped only a notch. After grossing what is expected to be a $900K day, it is on track for a three-day gross of $2.7M (or $7,068 per screen average) and $3.49M for the four-day (or about $9,136 per screen). Not bad, Pantelion Films. Ghostbusters&lsquo; 30th anniversary re-release scared in about $575K to $600K today so is falling on the lower end of this morning&rsquo;s estimates &mdash; so we figure it will be $1.7M for the three-day and $2.2M for the four-day. That&rsquo;s how it looks this evening and will update in the AM with a chart of the Top Ten. Goodnight.Amanda N&rsquo;Duka contributed to this story.3rd UPDATE, Saturday, 8:01 AM: No longer a horse race, Legendary Pictures&rsquo; first pic under its Universal deal &mdash; the micro-budgeted horror film As Above/So Below &ndash; opened the best of the newcomers and will take the No. 4 spot over Relativity actioner The November Man, which dropped to No. 6 this morning. The horror film should scare in $8.7M to $9.2M for the three-day and $10.3M to $11.1M for the four-day, while the Pierce Brosnan actioner should shoot in with $7.5M to $7.7M for the three-day and $9.5M to $9.8M for the four-day to bring its five-day cume (it opened last Wednesday) to $11M+. Relativity, which acquired November Man for U.S. distribution only for $3M, is on the hopeful end; The Solution Group is distributing the pic in Canada and internationally. As Above/So Below garnered a lousy C- CinemaScore from its core audience, but this one is likely to make its money back &mdash; so it just goes to show that even a low-quality mess can be profitable when the budget is tight.Disney/Marvel&rsquo;s Guardians of the Galaxy will continue its climb to become the No. 1 domestic grosser of 2014 and should end the weekend with around $278.5M, besting both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Lego Movie to reign supreme. Also playing strong is Paramount&rsquo;s sentimental favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which came in at No. 2 for a $11.2M three-day and about a $14.9M four-day, bringing its cume to $165.5M. Both pictures should reap a nice benefit from the family audiences this weekend.The best news, however, is for Cantinflas &mdash; the biopic about the beloved Mexican writer/producer/actor Mario Moreno &mdash; which is going to end up with a 4-day per screen average of $9,685 &mdash; a tremendous opening for this little picture from Lionsgate&rsquo;s Pantelion Films. Muy bien for the production and Oscar Jaenada! In re-releases, Jon Favreau&rsquo;s Chef will serve up over $30M after the holiday weekend, so Open Road Films hits its dish; so figure $30.4M for the cume. And the 30th anniversary re-release of Ghostbusters from Sony should bring in about $1.7M to $1.9M for the three-day and $2.3M to $2.5M total. Wonder if parents of the new generation of families will introduce their kids to this fun romp over the long holiday.Second weekend players include If I Stay, When the Game Stands Tall and Frank Miller&rsquo;s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (and a title I wish I could stop typing). Of those, Sony&rsquo;s When the Games Stands Tall had the best hold with a 37% drop from last weekend. This adult, inspirational drama is grabbing onto the positive word-of-mouth that it received from its strong CinemaScore last weekend and the studio thinks it might hit an $18M by Monday. If I Stay, which added about 100 theaters, kept its percentage drop to only 42% and got the No. 3 spot this holiday for Warner Bros. and MGM, which is distributing this adaptation of a YA novel. However, Sin City 2 (TWC) plummeted with a 66% drop off of last weekend&rsquo;s $6.3M miserable opening. The Robert Rodriguez, Aldamisa Entertainment blunder will gross only about $2.1M to bring its cume up to only $11.4M on a budget between $60M and $70M (not counting marketing and distribution costs). It was heavily pre-sold so that should lessen the write-off blow. It was a Dimension and Miramax Film. The Top Ten chart follows:Amanda N&rsquo;Duka contributed to this article.1).

The Star Lord is expected to take in around $15.5M and the Turtles are estimated to grab $11.3M to $11.6M for the three-day. Four-day gross estimates have them at $18.5M to $20M and $14.8M to $15.2M, respectively. Guardians will end up after this holiday as the highest domestic grosser of 2014, surpassing the other Marvel title Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The newcomers this weekend are pretty far down in the Top Ten in terms of gross receipts. According to tonight&rsquo;s estimates, The November Man which was exec-produced by its star Pierce Brosnan&rsquo;s Irish Dreamtime, is in horserace for the No. 4 spot with Legendary Pic&rsquo;s horror offering As Above/So Below from Universal and the fourth weekend of Fox&rsquo;s R-rated buddy comedy Let&rsquo;s Be Cops. All of the three are expected to be in the $7.89M to $8M+ range. It&rsquo;s just too close to call right now, but four-day numbers are listed below in the chart. Whereas November Man received a B+ CinemaScore, As Above/So Below received a C- CinemaScore from its core audience which translates to about a 2.3 multiple. This was said to be a micro-budget so if that&rsquo;s the case, it may end up making some money.In their sophomore frames, If I Stay &mdash; the Warner Bros.&rsquo; romancer based on the YA novel &mdash; is expected to drop about 42% take the No. 3 spot with a three-day gross of $9.1M and a four-day of roughly $11.3M to $11.5M. The studio added about 100 theaters this weekend. When the Games Stands Tall (SONY) held very well in its second weekend, down only 33%. The sports biopic garnered and A- CinemaScore last weekend so word-of-mouth is taking hold among its adult audience. Frank Miller&rsquo;s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For held its theaters but is expected to fall a walloping 68%. Sheesh, it&rsquo;s title is going to be longer than its theater run.Three other films are in re-release this weekend, the most beloved is, of course, the 30th anniversary relaunch of Sony&rsquo;s cult classic Ghostbusters, which is expected to take in around $1.7M for the 3-day and $2.27M for the 4-day. Its per screen average is sliming Sin City 2 all over the place &mdash; its per screen of $2,900 will be triple that of the Robert Rodriguez-directed sequel at $906. Meanwhile, Jon Favreau&rsquo;s Chef which added 652 theaters for a total run of 757 is expected to go over $30M after the four-day for Open Road Films. And Begin Again (TWC) on 335 screens is expected to add another million to bring its cume to $15.6M.NOTEWORTHY: In only 382 theaters, Lionsgate&rsquo;s Cantinflas &mdash; the biopic based on the beloved Mexican actor &mdash; opened to excellent numbers in moderate release and is expected to end the weekend with a per screen average of $9.162 for the four-day ($7,460 for the three-day).Numbers and positions may be clearer in the morning.

But that is a quick snapshot.PREVIOUSLY, Friday, 1:34 PM: Matinees are in for this weekend&rsquo;s openers and holdovers and, as expected, Disney/Marvel&rsquo;s Guardians Of The Galaxy is retaining the No. 1 spot after five weeks in release and is on track to gross an estimated $14.3M weekend and a total of about $18.5M over the long holiday. It should become the highest domestic grosser of the year this weekend, besting another Disney/Marvel title, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which was released in April and has grossed $259.7M, and Warner Bros&rsquo; animated The Lego Movie, with a gross of $257.7M since its February release.Relativity&rsquo;s newcomer The November Man, starring Pierce Brosnan, is second so far with a three-day total of around $12M at the moment and a four-day of $15M. Paramount&rsquo;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is still kicking it out in its fourth weekend in release and might take in about $10M more over the three-day weekend for a Labor Day haul of $13.2M.As Above, So Below might round out the weekend with $9.1M, or an $11M four-day gross. The Universal title bowed last night and scared up around $470K.Rounding out the Top Five is Fox&rsquo;s Let&rsquo;s Be Cops, which is running in with around $8.1M or a $10.4M bag of cash.&nbsp;
