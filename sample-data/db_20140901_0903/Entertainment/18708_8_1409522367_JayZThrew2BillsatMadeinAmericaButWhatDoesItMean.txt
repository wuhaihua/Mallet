PHILADELPHIA — Jay Z watches as the stack of $2 bills he tossed into the air rains down on the rowdy crowd at the Steve Aoki show at Made in America. 
Too enraptured with Aoki throwing cakes and showering them with champagne, the festival-goers thought little of what the unexpected money signified on Saturday night. All they knew was that is was Jay Z's music festival, and he could do whatever he wanted to do.

But the $2 bills, in fact, have a mysterious history in the music industry. The sightings of the uncommon paper money can be attributed to one wealthy lawyer: Mr. Steven Reisman, a human $2 bill dispensary for the stars in the hip-hop and rap world. 
Reisman also apparently spent Saturday before sundown handing out his trademark item:

Yooooo I'm officially official I got my 2 dollar bills from the 2 dollar bill guy!!! #madeinamerica pic.twitter.com/9QdHeb6MT5

Earlier this year, Complex investigated these $2 bill appearances, which started popping up at concerts and in celebrities' Instagram photos, linking everything back to Reisman: 
 
Nicknamed "The Two Dollar Bill Man," Reisman and his bills are now connected to such celebs as Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Michael Strahan, Justin Bieber and Big Sean.
