Abortionist Pic ‘Gosnell’ Hires ‘True Crime’ Writer To Script Abortionist Pic ‘Gosnell’ Hires ‘True Crime’ Writer To Script True Crime novelist, screenwriter, and conservative commentator Andrew Klavan (One Missed Call, A Shock To The System, Haunting Melissa) has been hired to script the crowdfunded TV film project Gosnell, about Philadelphia abortionist Dr. Kermit Gosnell. The infamous doctor was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder for mercilessly killing babies of botched abortions who were born alive by driving a scissors into their necks and snipping their spinal cords. His practices are believed to have gone on for as many as forty years and Gosnell is currently serving a life prison sentence without the possibility of parole.

				Klavan boards the project after the completion of an enormously successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, which raised $2,241,043 from 26,500 donors with the help of celeb backers like Kevin Sorbo. It became the most-funded campaign on the platform within its first three weeks. Husband and wife team Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney are producing Gosnell along with Magdalena Segieda. &ldquo;This is so much more than a job of work for me,&rdquo; said Klavan in a statement. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve begun to get into the research materials, it&rsquo;s started to come home to me that we&rsquo;ve all taken on a huge responsibility. The women who were brutalized by this Gosnell monster &mdash; they can tell their stories.  But all his victims, all those babies &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got to figure out a way to speak for them somehow.&rdquo;
