Claire Danes Sometimes 'Trapped by the Role' of Motherhood Claire Danes Sometimes 'Trapped by the Role' of Motherhood               

As CIA agent Carrie Mathison, actress         Claire Danes will become a single mother when her hit show "Homeland" returns for the fourth season.

In real life, Danes, the mother of nearly 2-year-old Cyrus, is married to actor Hugh Dancy, but even with a partner, she finds motherhood challenging.

"Being a mom is incredibly challenging, but we still feel a pressure to talk about it in very romantic terms. And it's not just that," she told the         UK edition of Harper's Bazaar.  "We all have that resentment at times and anxiety about being trapped by the role, that responsibility."

Danes told the October issue that the bigger adjustment to being a mom was realizing she was always on.

"Even if you have the most healthy relationship with your child and have support and resources, it's tough. It's really tough," she said. "And there's no 'off' button. [For me] that was the hardest adjustment. You always feel beholden to somebody. … And for so long they're like koala bears, you just feel a physical responsibility to be there for them to cling to. It's pretty primal."

Challenges aside, the award-winning actress, 35,  speaks with affection about her son.

"He's kind of revealing himself to be a bit of a ham, which shouldn't really be a surprise," she said. "A babysitter gave him a kiss goodbye and now he does 'Mwah, mwah' to everybody"

She also speaks with love about Dancy, whom she married in 2009.

"I'm genuinely in love with him," she told Harper's. "You know, marriage is hard, but I'm up for it."

She continued, "There's so much opportunity if you are interested in each other to go further. It's kind of a beautiful exercise. … And life keeps it interesting for you. Like having a baby. The demands are different; that has been dictated by circumstance. So we haven't had to liven it up. Life just keeps livening it up for us."
