Primetime Emmys Telecast Rules Quiet Holiday Week’s Twitter TV Ratings Primetime Emmys Telecast Rules Quiet Holiday Week’s Twitter TV Ratings The Emmys might not be No. 1 among awards shows in terms of ratings or social-media oomph, but they dominated the week&rsquo;s Twitter TV ratings, nearly doubling even the biggest sports event, the season-opening college football game featuring&nbsp;defending national champ Florida State and its Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston, now a sophomore.

				Most weeks, it&rsquo;s a sports event that tops Nielsen&rsquo;s&nbsp;most tweeted-about lists. But with a holiday weekend on the back end, the Emmys on the front end and not much in between but&nbsp;a batch of college football games to distract sports fans, the TV awards show now can claim at least one smallish crown for itself.Elsewhere,&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;put two episodes in the top 10 for series and specials, while the star-filled going-away episode for&nbsp;Chelsea Handler&nbsp;grabbed sixth place on the comedian&rsquo;s way out the door at E!
