PR Firm Apologizes For ‘Sleepy Hollow’ “Headless Day” Promo After Beheading Of Second US Journalist PR Firm Apologizes For ‘Sleepy Hollow’ “Headless Day” Promo After Beheading Of Second US Journalist A PR firm drumming up buzz for Fox&rsquo;s Sleepy Hollow series apologized for launching an ill-conceived &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow Headless Day&rdquo; campaign Tuesday after news of a second American journalist killed by decapitation was made public. The Sleepy Hollow &ldquo;Headless Day&rdquo; promo was released shortly after news broke that Steven Sotloff had been beheaded at the hands of ISIS militants, and 14 days after video surfaced of the same group beheading captured American photojournalist James Foley.

				&ldquo;We apologize for the unfortunate timing of our Sleepy Hollow Headless Day announcement. The tragic news of Steven Sotloff&rsquo;s death hit the web as the email was being sent. Our deepest sympathies are with him and his family, and we don&rsquo;t take the news lightly. Had we have known this information prior, we would have never released the alert and realize it&rsquo;s in poor taste,&rdquo; read the mea culpa email from ThinkJam, which has offices in London, New York, and Los Angeles. The PR campaign features a quartet of cheerily morbid e-cards celebrating decapitation (see below) and was issued from ThinkJam&rsquo;s LA office to promote the show&rsquo;s September 16 digital, Blu-ray, and DVD release. The initial Sleepy Hollow Headless Day email trumpeted September 2 as National Beheading Day along with the social media hashtag #HeadlessDay: A ThinkJam rep says the Headless Day campaign was pre-approved by Fox. It was scheduled in advance to go out today &ldquo;as a lighthearted way to celebrate the title&rdquo; and was sent &ldquo;to [journalists] we thought would enjoy it.&rdquo;
