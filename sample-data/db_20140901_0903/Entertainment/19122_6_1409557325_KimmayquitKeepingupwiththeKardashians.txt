					Los Angeles: The "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star Kim Kardashian is reportedly thinking about quitting reality television after her husband Kanye West suggested it would be a good idea."While Kanye would never make Kim do something, he would rather she didn't star on the show," contactmusic.com quoted a source as saying."He wants to live his life in private and he just thinks Kim would be better off doing the same. She is gradually coming around to the same thinking," added the source.However, it is a "difficult" decision for Kim to make because her name is a big selling point for her family show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"."It's a difficult one for her because most of her family rely on her being there selling her life to the cameras," said a source."It is very likely that she will bow out shortly, though the series is still such a massive hit," added the source.IANS
