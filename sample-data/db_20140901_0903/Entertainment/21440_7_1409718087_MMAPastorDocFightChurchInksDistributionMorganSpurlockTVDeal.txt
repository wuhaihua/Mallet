				Co-directed by Oscar-winner Daniel Junge (Saving Face, Beyond the Brick: A LEGO Brickumentary) and Bryan Storkel (Holy Rollers: The True Story of Card Counting Christians), Fight Church follows several MMA-battling ministers who preach from the pulpit and the octagon and even train fighters using the teachings of the Bible.  Lionsgate sprang for North American VOD rights and will debut the film on iTunes and additional digital platforms on September 16, while Netflix will premiere it in multiple territories this Fall. Given the success of faith-themed content and the controversial subject matter the topic is ripe for exploration; after Deadline premiered the trailer this spring, the film made headlines and drew heated debate online. Oscar-nominated Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me) will spin-off Fight Church for television via his New York-based Warrior Poets company, which is developing a docu reality series based on the film. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always looking for docs that can cross-over to the TV world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The controversial nature of this project and the buzz it is already getting around the country, make this particular one the perfect candidate.&rdquo; Fight Church is produced by Eben Kostbar and Joseph McKelheer and also features interviews with pro fighters Benson Henderson and Jon Jones.  The Film Sales Company is repping international digital rights.
