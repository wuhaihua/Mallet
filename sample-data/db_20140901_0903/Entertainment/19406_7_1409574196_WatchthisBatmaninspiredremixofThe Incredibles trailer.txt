        Dark, gritty, and violent, yet thoughtful and thought-provoking — such has been the style of Christopher Nolan's Batman films, and it has now been applied to Pixar's 2004 superhero movie The Incredibles. The resulting trailer mixes music from The Dark Knight with a menacing voiceover from antihero Syndrome to build up tension toward an explosive, though inconclusive, finale. Whereas the family-friendly original reached its predictable happy ending, this darker reimagining of The Incredibles leaves you guessing as to the eventual fate of the superhero protagonists.
