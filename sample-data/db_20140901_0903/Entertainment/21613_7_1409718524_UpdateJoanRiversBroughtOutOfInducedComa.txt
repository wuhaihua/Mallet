Last month she stormed out of an interview with CNN&lsquo;s Fredricka Whitfield, after Whitfield called Rivers&rsquo; trademark fashion blasts &ldquo;mean,&rdquo;&nbsp; and asked Rivers if she was concerned the fur she was wearing on the cover of her new book might offend animal rights activists. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the person to interview someone who does humor,&rdquo;&nbsp; Rivers snapped as she exited.
