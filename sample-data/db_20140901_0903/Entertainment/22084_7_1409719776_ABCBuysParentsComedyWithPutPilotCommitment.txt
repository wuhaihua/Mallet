ABC Buys Parents Comedy With Put Pilot Commitment ABC Buys Parents Comedy With Put Pilot Commitment ABC&rsquo;s two strongest comedy series, Modern Family and The Middle, are about families with kids. The network is adding two more &mdash; Black-ish and Fresh Off The Boat &mdash; this coming season, and now it has put another in development for next season. ABC has handed a put pilot commitment to a single-camera comedy from American Dad co-executive producer Judah Miller and 20th Century Fox TV. It centers on Tony Award-winning mother and a cerebral, risk-averse father blessed with a natural-born athlete for a son. They are forced to come to terms with the fact that raising their only child won&rsquo;t come as easily as they thought. Miller is executive producing with 3 Arts&rsquo; Tom Lassally and Jonathan Berry. This is the second put pilot commitment for a 20th TV-produced comedy project today. The studio also sold an ensemble multi-camera half-hour produced by Jason Winer to NBC. UTA-repped Miller is the executive producer/showrunner on the well received USA comedy Playing House.
