					Mumbai: For now, all of Fawad Khan's energy is concentrated towards making a career in Bollywood, says the Pakistani actor-singer who is making his filmi debut&nbsp;with Khoobsurat.He enjoys a huge fan following in his homeland, and now in India, thanks to&nbsp;Zee's channel Zindagi, which airs his Pakistani TV shows here. &nbsp;But TV is not Khan's&nbsp;priority as of now."I would want to stay away from TV right now. I have done as much as I could" Khan told IANS."I'm a very big fan of Hollywood. I really like what's happening there right now, where the marriage between cinema and TV is amazing. Things are changing here (in India), but it's only the tip of the iceberg, it's just started," he added.The actor, who has been part of TV shows like Humsafar and Zindagi Gulzar Hai, says he's entering cinema "because I get to learn something from it".In India, Khan&nbsp;is making his Hindi film debut with Khoobsurat, which stars Sonam Kapoor as the female lead. The actor was not apprehensive about the fact that Khoobsurat is a heroine-driven film.The process of choosing the film was "pretty easy" for him, he said."I didn't have any apprehension working in a female-centric film as I have done this back at home. It all depends more on the content, director and co-actors you work with," the 32-year-old added.Directed by Shashanka Ghosh, Khoobsurat is the remake of 1980 super hit film of&nbsp;the same name.IANS
