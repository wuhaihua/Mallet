Someone Finally Made the Glorious Loki Movie You’ve Been Waiting For Someone Finally Made the Glorious Loki Movie You’ve Been Waiting For There are few villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe more beloved than Loki. Actually, probably none. (Just ask, like, anyone on Tumblr.) Devotion to the Asgardian mischief-maker&mdash;or to Tom Hiddleston, who plays him&mdash;has reached such proportions that many fans would probably fight Frost Giants to get Marvel to make a stand-alone Loki flick. Even then, Marvel may not grant that wish. In the interim, fans have Loki: Brother of Thor. 
The movie (above) combines footage from Thor, The Avengers, and Thor: The Dark World (and even some deleted scenes and a snippet of Guardians of the Galaxy) to create a Loki-view&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;My goal was to chronicle the character development of Loki into a single narrative,&rdquo; Vimeo user &ldquo;Loki Odinson&rdquo; (an alias burdened with glorious purpose) writes in the clip&rsquo;s description. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice I took out a lot of fluff and even some beloved fight scenes, only because I was trying to focus the film on Loki and his relationships.&rdquo; 
That sound you hear is half of the internet calling in sick today. Pop some popcorn, Hiddlestoners&mdash;this one is for you.
