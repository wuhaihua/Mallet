Angelina Jolie Let Kids Draw All Over Her Wedding Veil And Dress Angelina Jolie Let Kids Draw All Over Her Wedding Veil And Dress &nbsp;&nbsp;		
	Angelina Jolie and her custom-made Versace wedding dress adorn this week&#8217;s issue of &#8220;People Magazine,&#8221; and it turns out she let her six kids draw all over it and her veil.
The six prodigies drew some very artistic stick figures, cats, dogs, among other indistinguishable doodles, which Jolie had hand-embroidered and put on her gown, because what good is spending a ton of money on a silk gown if you can&#8217;t scribble all over it?

Not only did the six kids, all between the ages six and 13, design her dress, they also planned the wedding, wrote the vows, and walked her down the aisle.
Be sure to pick the little Pitt-Jolie children to plan your next wedding! (RELATED: Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt Broke Their Vow To Gay Couples)
