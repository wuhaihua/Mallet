Susan Lyne Moves From AOL’s Brand Group To A New Fund For Women-led Internet Ventures Susan Lyne Moves From AOL’s Brand Group To A New Fund For Women-led Internet Ventures The former president of ABC Entertainment and CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia is now also the former CEO of AOL&rsquo;s Brand Group. She just left the&nbsp;job that she took in February 2013&nbsp;after the&nbsp;Internet company asked her to be president of&nbsp;its&nbsp;new venture entity, The BBG Fund. The name of the fund is an acronym for Built By Girls and AOL says it will be &ldquo;focused on early stage investments in women-led consumer internet start-ups.&rdquo; AOL will put about&nbsp;$10M into it, but investments will be performance based &mdash; meaning that AOL expects to see a return. Lyne will continue to report to CEO Tim Armstrong. The fund is one of several initiatives that Lyne will unveil next month during Ad Week, a series of ad-related meetings and presentations in NYC.

				&ldquo;We have a huge megaphone at AOL so we can have an outsized impact on the way girls and women perceive their options, and on the breadth of entrepreneurial ideas that have a chance to compete,&rdquo; Lyne says. &ldquo;But this is also good business: women are the majority of users on the fastest-growing sites and services on the internet. We believe we can get strong returns by focusing on entrepreneurs who know the customer best.&rdquo;AOL says that the investment community gives women short shrift. Just&nbsp;4% of the partners at venture firms are female. Women entrepreneurs receive only 7% of venture funding.As head of the Brand Group, Lyne&nbsp;oversaw AOL media properties including&nbsp;Engadget and TechCrunch &mdash; but not The Huffington Post, which of course is&nbsp;run by&nbsp;Arianna Huffington.&nbsp;With Lyne&rsquo;s move, Media Brand President Maureen Sullivan will continue to oversee AOL.com as well as&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;lifestyle brands and money portfolio. Another Media Brands President, Luke Beatty, will be in charge of AOL&rsquo;s technology, autos and entertainment properties as well as the Experimental Products team.In April, Lyne helped to lead AOL&rsquo;s effort to persuade advertisers to spend some of the cash that they traditionally devote to TV on digital video platforms including AOL&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;We need to be scouts, curators, wide open to talent &hellip; on every platform the tech world is dreaming up,&rdquo; she said in her Newfront presentation.&nbsp;In addition to her work at AOL, Lyne sits on the boards of&nbsp;Gilt Groupe (she&rsquo;s its former CEO) and Starz.&nbsp;
