				The deal is a successor to a Legendary/Warner Bros. project earlier this year for&nbsp;Godzilla.&nbsp;Sets from that film were installed at the YouTube Space L.A., located in the Playa Vista neighborhood, and 30 YouTube creators were chosen based on their proposals to make a wide variety of videos with&nbsp;Godzilla involved in some fashion.&nbsp;In this latest deal, gothic-horror sets &ldquo;inspired by&rdquo; Del Toro&rsquo;s work on Crimson Peak&nbsp;will be installed in YouTube Spaces in Los Angeles, Tokyo, London and the soon-to-open New York. The sets will vary by site, but are billed as&nbsp;the sorts of creepy backdrops worthy of any Gothic horror film, including &ldquo;a Great Room from an old manor house,&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;a sinister staircase and Gothic windows that lead out to a haunted garden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an abandoned Solarium cluttered with over-grown plants, birdcages and weathered tools.&rdquo;YouTube creators at&nbsp;each site will be invited to make&nbsp;video shorts with horror themes using the sets between Sept. 22 and Oct. 28. The videos will go live between Oct. 21 and&nbsp;Halloween. The resulting videos will run on each creator&rsquo;s YouTube site along with the channels for YouTube Spaces and Legendary.Del Toro will pick the best videos from each site, and consult with the creators on further fine-tuning. Legendary will offer a development deal to the creator behind the&nbsp;best resulting short to further flesh out their project into a possible film. If it all works, Legendary could find a ultra-low-budget creator similar to Jason Blum, whom Universal has recently&nbsp;signed to a long-term deal after a lucrative run of cheap and extremely profitable horror pics.Here&rsquo;s a video of Del Toro introducing the YouTube House of Horrors project:
