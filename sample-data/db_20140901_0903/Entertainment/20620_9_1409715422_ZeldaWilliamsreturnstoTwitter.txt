Zelda Williams returns to Twitter Zelda Williams returns to Twitter Zelda Williams has returned to Twitter after quitting the social media site days after the death of her father Robin Williams.Simply tweeting "Thank you" on Monday, the 25-year-old linked to a quote by Harvey Fierstein on her Tumblr.

Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself."Thank you. http://t.co/e2hve7fD50 Zelda Williams (@zeldawilliams) September 1, 2014On Aug. 13, Zelda announced that she would be leaving Twitter and Instagram for a spell after she encountered some negativity. She wrote on Instagram: "I will be leaving this account for a [bit] but while I heal and decide if I'll be deleting it or not. In this difficult time, please try to be respectful of the accounts of myself, my family and my friends. Mining our accounts for photos of dad, or judging me on the number of them is cruel and unnecessary. There are a couple throughout, but the real private moments I shared with him were precious, quiet, and believe it or not, not full of photos or 'selfies.'"Before temporarily deleting the account, Zelda also spent some time fighting critics on her Twitter who were posting mean comments about her father's suicide. Many of these users were also tweeting her a fake photo of her father's body at the Coroner's office. She later deleted those tweets and decided to remove herself from social media altogether.She tweeted at the time: "I'm sorry. I should've risen above. Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye."Do you think Zelda should return to Twitter? See her sweet message to her father, below:Robin Williams died on Aug. 11, 2014, from an apparent suicide. He was 63.
