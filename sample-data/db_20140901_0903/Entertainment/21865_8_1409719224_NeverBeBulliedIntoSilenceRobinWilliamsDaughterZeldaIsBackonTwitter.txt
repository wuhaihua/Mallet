Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, has returned to Twitter after deactivating her account last month. She left the platform, she said, because of "cruel and unnecessary" tweets about her late father, who died on Aug. 11 in what has been ruled a suicide. 
The 25-year-old actress returned to Twitter over Labor Day weekend with a simple "thank you" message and a link that directed her 220,000 followers to a quotation on her Tumblr page she attributes to actor Harvey Fierstein. 

"Never be bullied into silence," it reads. "Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself." (Fierstein appeared in Mrs. Doubtfire, the 1993 comedy starring Robin Williams.)

Thank you. http://t.co/e2hve7fD50

The tweet comes nearly 3 weeks after she deactivated her account on Aug. 13:

I'm sorry. I should've risen above. Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye.

She also left Instagram at the time, though that account is now set to private. 
When her 63-year-old father died, she issued a lengthy, emotional statement on the Tumblr page, in which she talked about her final moment with her dad. 
"My last day with him was his birthday, and I will be forever grateful that my brothers and I got to spend that time alone with him, sharing gifts and laughter," she wrote.
