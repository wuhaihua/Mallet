It's official: GoT Queen Cersei to walk nude It's official: GoT Queen Cersei to walk nude 
					Los Angeles: Popular TV series 'Game of Thrones' has finally got the green light from the Croatian film commission to shoot a nude scene of Queen Cersei.The pivotal scene will see the Queen Regent of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros walking nude from a church and onto the streets of King's Landing as penance, reported Ace Showbiz.The scene was previously in jeopardy as the Church of St Nicholas, where the scene would be filmed, has a strict policy against public nudity.The film commissioners, however, have now changed their initial ruling, giving a permission to the filming on the streets of Dubrovik as long as Lena Headey, who plays Cersei, doesn't film it at the church.The show's producers, thus, have to compromise with the new term set by the film commissioners. Headey will shoot those scenes on a fake church set.PTI
