The couple were married Sunday, McCarthy's rep told ABC News. The ceremony was held outside Chicago, TheAssociated Press reported.

Wahlberg, 45, proposed to McCarthy, 41, this past April, with a 10-carat yellow sapphire ring.  Her son, Evan, helped his new step-father pop the question, which made the moment even more special for the former "View" host.

"Of course I said, 'Yes,'" she said of the proposal, adding, "In that moment, Evan yelled, 'I have another dad!' and it made all of us cry."

Wedding planning came next, and McCarthy knew exactly how she wanted to look on her big day.

"It's my second wedding and with me being older, I don't want to look like a virgin bride," she said. "I want to look classy and elegant and age appropriate."

This is the second marriage for both.
