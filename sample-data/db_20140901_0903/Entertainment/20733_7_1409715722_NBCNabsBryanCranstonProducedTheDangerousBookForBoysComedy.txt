Mottola executive produces with Moon Shot&rsquo;s Cranston and James Degus.This has been a passion project for Cranston who optioned the rights to the best-selling 2006 British book in June and helped shape up the idea for the series. Sony TV has kept all key auspices of its acclaimed AMC series Breaking Bad in the fold, with stars Cranston and Aaron Paul under first-look deals and creator Vince Gilligan in an overall agreement. All three were victorious at the Emmy Awards last weekend where Breaking Bad swept the drama series categories, including best drama series, for its final batch of episodes. Cranston won his fourth best drama actor Emmy and shared in the show&rsquo;s best drama win in his capacity as a producer.
