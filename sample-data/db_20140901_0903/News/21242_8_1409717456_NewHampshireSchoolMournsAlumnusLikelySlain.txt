New Hampshire School Mourns Alumnus Likely Slain New Hampshire School Mourns Alumnus Likely Slain 
 

A New Hampshire school is mourning the apparent videotaped slaying of a former student who vanished in Syria last year.

A video surfaced Tuesday purportedly showing 31-year-old journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded by the Islamic State group in Syria. Two weeks ago the group posted a video showing New Hampshire journalist James Foley's beheading.

Sotloff graduated in 2002 from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden. The Academy says in a statement on its website he revitalized its student newspaper, was on the student council and played varsity football and rugby.

Head of School Mike Schafer says he got emails from Sotloff in 2011 from Libya, where he said he was often under fire or in hiding.

Schafer calls Sotloff's work a mission to provide an accurate and realistic global perspective.
