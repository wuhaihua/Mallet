NTSB: Pilot in Ohio Crash Was Trying to Turn Back NTSB: Pilot in Ohio Crash Was Trying to Turn Back 
 

A National Transportation Safety Board report says the pilot of a small plane was trying to return to a suburban Cleveland airport last week when the aircraft plummeted to the ground, killing all four college students aboard.

The preliminary report says the pilot told the controller he was not climbing fast and asked for permission to make a left turn. The controller says the plane appears to have crashed after the pilot began turning. The aircraft struck the ground and smashed through a fence before it came to rest about 1,000 feet past the end of the 5,100-foot runway.

An NTSB spokesman declined to comment Monday.

The four men were students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. They planned a nighttime sightseeing trip after their first day of classes.
