A former newsman who worked for The Associated Press for 39 years has died in New York. Bruce Hodgman was 76.

His wife, Marion Hodgman, says he died Friday at a hospital 18 months after he was diagnosed with cancer.

Hodgman began his AP career in 1962 in Hartford, Connecticut, as a capitol correspondent, sending reports by teletype. He transferred to AP headquarters in New York three years later, working as an editor and supervisor until his 2001 retirement.

Retired managing editor Darrell Christian says Hodgson had unswerving dedication and a steady news sense and was quick with a kind word and a helping hand.

Hodgman also is survived by three children and four grandchildren. A funeral is set for Thursday at New Utrecht Reformed Church in Brooklyn.
