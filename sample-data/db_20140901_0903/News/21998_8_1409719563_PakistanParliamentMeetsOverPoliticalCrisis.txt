Pakistan Parliament Meets Over Political Crisis Pakistan Parliament Meets Over Political Crisis 
Pakistan's parliament has convened over the political crisis roiling the country as thousands of anti-government protesters remain camped out in front of the parliament building, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

The Tuesday session of both houses — the National Assembly and the Senate — is an attempt to rally support behind the prime minister.

Sharif called the session after weekend clashes between protesters and police left three people dead and hundreds wounded.

The demonstrators are camped outside the parliament building, sleeping in tents on lawns and refusing to give up their demands.

The rallies are led by cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan and fiery cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri. They allege widespread fraud in the May 2013 election that brought Sharif to power.
