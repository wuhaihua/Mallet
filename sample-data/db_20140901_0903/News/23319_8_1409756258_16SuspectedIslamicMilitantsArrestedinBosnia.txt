16 Suspected Islamic Militants Arrested in Bosnia 16 Suspected Islamic Militants Arrested in Bosnia 
Bosnian police said Wednesday they have detained 16 people suspected of having fought in Syria and Iraq or of recruiting and funding other Balkan men to join the Islamic militants there.

Police said about 200 officers from a number of Bosnian law enforcement agencies were involved in an operation targeting 17 locations around the country.

The arrested were suspected of "recruiting (Bosnian) nationals for Syria and Iraq and funding and organizing their travel" to the two countries, police said. They were also suspected of "participating in armed conflicts in Syria and Iraq where they fought alongside radical terrorist groups and organizations," including Islamic State.

During the search of locations where suspects were arrested, police found and seized weapons, ammunition, computer equipment, telephone cards and propaganda materials.

Earlier this year, Bosnia introduced prison terms of up to 10 years for its citizens who fight in conflicts abroad or recruit others.
