Mexico Plans $9.2B Airport Project for Capital Mexico Plans $9.2B Airport Project for Capital 
Mexico's president is announcing the construction of a new international airport for the capital that will quadruple the capacity of the current one.

Enrique Pena Nieto says the facility will have six runways and be capable of handling 120 million passengers a year. It will cost an estimated $9.2 billion, according to a written report delivered to Mexico's Congress.

More than a decade ago, protests led authorities to scrap a proposed new airport on the outskirts of Mexico City. The new proposal is to build on federally owned land next to the existing airport.

Pena Nieto spoke Tuesday during his second state-of-the-nation address.
