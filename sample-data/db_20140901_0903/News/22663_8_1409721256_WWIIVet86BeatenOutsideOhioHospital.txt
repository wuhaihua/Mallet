An 86-year-old World War II veteran was recovering Tuesday after being beaten outside a southwest Ohio hospital where he was visiting his ailing wife, authorities said.

Police arrested 30-year-old Craig Phelps on charges of robbery and other counts including that he had a needle for heroin use. Phelps was being held Tuesday in Hamilton County Jail on $25,000 bond.

Police said Phelps tried to steal Paul Browning's wallet outside Good Samaritan Hospital on Sunday. Browning was there visiting his wife of 65 years. Family members say the two met in Italy during World War II.

Phelps is accused of "slamming the victim against a wall, causing severe physical harm to his face," a police affidavit stated. Family members say Browning was left bruised and swollen and required stitches in his mouth, and was expected to be hospitalized a few days.

Browning's son, Marvin Browning, said he got jumped just after leaving the hospital to go to his car.

"He (Paul Browning) said, 'I thought, I need to get away from there in case he came back,'" Marvin Browning said. He said his father drove home, and his family brought him back to the hospital for treatment.

His family members say he's tough and will recover. However, doctors are also checking out a potential heart issue.

"He's like dad always is, he'll be OK," his son said. "That's just what he says, 'Everything's OK.' "

Phelps is due in court Sept. 10. A message left Tuesday for an attorney assigned to Phelps was not immediately returned.
