Philippine House Rejects Aquino Impeachment Philippine House Rejects Aquino Impeachment 
The Philippine House of Representatives' justice committee has rejected three impeachment complaints against President Benigno Aquino III.

The committee, dominated by Aquino allies, voted against the complaints, 54-4, on Tuesday, declaring them insufficient in substance and killing the challenges.

The complaints were filed by mostly left-wing activists and sponsored by the House's left-wing bloc. They accused Aquino of culpable violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust and corruption.

The complaints cited Aquino's implementation of a major economic stimulus program declared partly unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and a defense cooperation agreement that gives American troops greater access to bases across the Philippines.

The son of pro-democracy icons, Aquino won the presidency by a wide margin in 2010 on a promise to rid his nation of corruption and widespread poverty.
