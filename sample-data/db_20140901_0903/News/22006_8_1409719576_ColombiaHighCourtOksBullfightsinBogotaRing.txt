Colombia High Court Oks Bullfights in Bogota Ring Colombia High Court Oks Bullfights in Bogota Ring 
A Colombian high court says bullfights can return to Bogota's historic ring, more than two months after they were suspended by the capital city's mayor.

The Constitutional Court's press office says the high court agreed with the Corporacion Taurina de Bogota, which organizes the bullfights. The company says it has the right to hold bullfights there at least through the end of its contract in March 2015.

There was no immediate response by Mayor Gustavo Petro.

Fourteen apprentice bullfighters have been on hunger strike to protest moves to eliminate the blood sport in Bogota, but they say they won't end their protest until they know what Petro is going to do.

Bullfighting has been practiced in Colombia since the 1800s, with about 100 bullfights held here each year.
