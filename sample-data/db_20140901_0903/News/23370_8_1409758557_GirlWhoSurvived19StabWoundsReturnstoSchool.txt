Girl Who Survived 19 Stab Wounds Returns to School Girl Who Survived 19 Stab Wounds Returns to School 
 

The 12-year-old Wisconsin girl who nearly died after she was stabbed 19 times is back in school.

A spokesman for the girl's family says it has been a summer of doctor's appointments, surgeries, specialists and recovery. Stephen Lyons says the girl has been eager to go back to school in Waukesha. She started the 7th grade on Tuesday.

Lyons tells WITI-TV (         http://bit.ly/1tt3UBZ ) that the girl and her family continue to attend therapy sessions to deal with the emotional scars of the ordeal.

Court documents say two classmates plotted for months to kill the girl to curry favor with a fictional Slender Man character they read about online. One of two preteens accused in the stabbing has been ordered to receive treatment rather than stand trial.
