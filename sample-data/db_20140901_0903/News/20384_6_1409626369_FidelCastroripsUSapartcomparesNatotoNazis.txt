Fidel Castro rips US apart, compares Nato to Nazis Fidel Castro rips US apart, compares Nato to Nazis 
					Havana: Cuban ex-president Fidel Castro&nbsp;lashed out at the United States and Europe yesterday, accusing&nbsp;them of war-mongering and comparing the Nato military&nbsp;alliance's representatives to the Nazi SS.&nbsp;In a tortuous column published in Cuban state media, the&nbsp;father of the island's communist revolution also attacked US&nbsp;Senator John McCain over United States policy in the Middle&nbsp;East, calling him "Israel's most unconditional ally."The world has seen no respite in recent years,&nbsp;particularly since the European Economic Community, under the&nbsp;strict and unconditional leadership of the United States,&nbsp;decided the time had come to settle scores with what was left&nbsp;of two great nations (Russia and China) that... had carried&nbsp;out the heroic deed of putting an end to the imperialist&nbsp;colonial order imposed on the world by Europe and the United&nbsp;States," said the 88-year-old leader.He accused the West of "cynicism" and said the trait had&nbsp;become "a symbol of imperialist policy."&nbsp;He singled out McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential&nbsp;candidate, saying he had supported Israel's Mossad&nbsp;intelligence agency and "participated together with that&nbsp;service in the creation of the Islamic State, which today&nbsp;controls a considerable and vital portion of Iraq and&nbsp;reportedly one-third of Syria as well."Turning to Nato, Castro said the alliance's&nbsp;representatives were reminiscent of Nazi Germany's feared SS.&nbsp;"Many people are astonished when they hear the statements&nbsp;made by some European spokesmen for Nato when they speak with&nbsp;the style and face of the Nazi SS," he said."Adolf Hitler's greed-based empire went down in history&nbsp;with no more glory than the encouragement provided to Nato's&nbsp;aggressive and bourgeois governments, which makes them the&nbsp;laughing stock of Europe and the world."Castro handed power to his younger brother Raul in 2006&nbsp;amid a health crisis, and has since devoted his time to&nbsp;writing books and articles and receiving foreign dignitaries.AFP
