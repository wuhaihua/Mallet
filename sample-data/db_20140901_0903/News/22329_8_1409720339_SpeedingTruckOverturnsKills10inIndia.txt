Police say a speeding truck has overturned and crushed to death 10 people, including seven children, sleeping on a sidewalk in northern India.

Police spokesman Suresh Srivastava says the accident occurred early Wednesday near a construction site in Kanpur, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.

The victims were workers and their family members, Srivastava said Wednesday. Two critically injured people have been hospitalized.

He says the truck driver fled after the accident.

Witnesses say the truck overturned when the driver tried to turn a sharp corner at high speed.

India has the world's deadliest roads, with more than 110,000 people killed annually. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles.
