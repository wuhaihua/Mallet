Kenneth Bae's Family Worried About His Health Kenneth Bae's Family Worried About His Health 
 

The sister of an American missionary held nearly two years in North Korea says she is worried about Kenneth Bae's health and wellbeing.

In a statement released Monday after Bae gave a brief news conference in North Korea with other detained Americans, Terri Chung of Edmonds, Washington, said it's clear Bae is in a lot of pain.

In addition to back pain, Bae is also suffering from isolation. Chung says the normally cheerful man is isolated in a North Korean labor camp, with little human contact.

Chung appealed to North Korean officials to show mercy and release her brother. She says he has confessed to the crimes with which he has been charged and has served a longer detainment than any other American since the war.
