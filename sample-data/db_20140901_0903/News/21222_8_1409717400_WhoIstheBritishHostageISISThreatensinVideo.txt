He was very caring, had a good sense of humor.&quot;A LinkedIn profile for Haines lists him as the director of a Croatia-based company that supplies kitchen equipment. A woman with the same last name who is listed as an executive of the company declined comment. &quot;Thank you for understanding,&quot; she said.Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Haines was a British soldier.
