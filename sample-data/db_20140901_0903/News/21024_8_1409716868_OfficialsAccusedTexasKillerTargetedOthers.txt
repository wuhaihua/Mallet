Officials: Accused Texas Killer Targeted Others Officials: Accused Texas Killer Targeted Others 
 

The man charged in the deaths last year of two North Texas prosecutors had intended to kill other law enforcement officials, according to court documents filed Tuesday.

The records contend former Justice of the Peace Eric Williams sought to kill Kaufman County District Attorney Erleigh Norville Wiley, who was previously a judge in that county, just east of Dallas. Authorities also allege Williams had targeted a former district court judge, Glen Ashworth.

The documents filed in Kaufman County do not indicate why Williams allegedly sought to kill Wiley and Ashworth. But WFAA-TV in Dallas reports that Williams had worked with Ashworth as a court coordinator prior to getting his law degree.

Williams faces capital murder charges in the shooting deaths of District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, at their home in Forney, Texas. He's also accused of killing Kaufman County prosecutor Mark Hasse.

Authorities believe Williams bore a grudge against McLelland and Hasse for successfully prosecuting him for stealing three county-owned computer monitors. That conviction cost Williams his law license and his job as a justice of the peace.

The court records were filed Tuesday by special prosecutor Bill Wirskye in the lead-up to Williams' December trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Williams' estranged wife Kim also is accused in the killings, and the documents filed Tuesday reveal she will testify against him.

Records also allege Eric Williams called in a false tip to authorities after the Hasse killing in an effort to derail their investigation. Williams also had impersonated a police officer as part of the McLelland slayings, the records say.

Citing the massive amount of evidence collected in the case, attorneys for Williams have sought to delay court proceedings in the case, which has been moved to Rockwall County, WFAA reported.
