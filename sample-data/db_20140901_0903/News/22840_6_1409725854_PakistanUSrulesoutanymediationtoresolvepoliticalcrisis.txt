Pakistan: US rules out any mediation to resolve political crisis Pakistan: US rules out any mediation to resolve political crisis 
					Washington: Amid the escalating political crisis in Pakistan, the US has ruled out any mediation in that country and asked all stakeholders to work together to resolve their differences through peaceful democratic means."We're in no way involved in the process or discussions between parties," State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference yesterday.She was responding to questions on the current political turmoil in Pakistan wherein cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan is leading a protest in Islamabad seeking resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, alleging that the last year's general elections was rigged."(We) can offer no real analysis of what's happening there beyond just reiterating our belief that the parties should work together to resolve differences through peaceful dialogue and ways to strengthen Pakistan&rsquo;s democracy and rule of law," Psaki said.On media reports about pamphlets and brochures being distributed in Pakistan asking people to start campaigning against the Shia community, she said, "I don't have any confirmation of this. Obviously, I'm sure you're watching events like this closely. I think, again, part of our effort underway is not limited to a specific part of the world to take on this threat."That's why the Secretary (of State) is speaking to a range of counterparts, not just in countries that are directly next to Iraq or Syria, but countries that are around the world that may be concerned about the threat that ISIL is posing."Think-tank American Enterprise Institute said Pakistan is in the throes of a severe political crisis that seriously threatens the sitting government's survival and has allowed the country's powerful and historically politically active army to gain ground at the expense of the civilian government.PTI
