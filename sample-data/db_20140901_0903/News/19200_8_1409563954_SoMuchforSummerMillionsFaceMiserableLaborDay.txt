The Weather Channel reported that this area was at risk from high winds, large hail and even tornadoes.A less-severe moist air mass was set to affect large areas of the East, bringing scattered showers and up to three inches of rain from Virginia to New England throughout the day. &quot;The folks in the Midwest look to be in for a pretty miserable day,&quot; said Roy Lucksinger, principal meteorologist at The Weather Channel. &quot;But across the East my gut feeling is it will be more of a coin toss in most areas. People should keep their eye on the skies if they are planning an outdoor cook-up.&quot; The stormy holiday weekend has already seen three people hospitalized after they were hit by lightning at a New York City beach on Sunday. Bad weather also caused a stop in play at the U.S. Open tennis tournament and forced the early end to New York's Electric Zoo music festival.IN-DEPTHINFOGRAPHIC: So Long, Summer!
