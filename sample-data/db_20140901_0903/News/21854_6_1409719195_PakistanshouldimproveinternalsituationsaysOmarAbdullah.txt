Pakistan should improve internal situation, says Omar Abdullah Pakistan should improve internal situation, says Omar Abdullah 
					Jammu: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah today hit out at Pakistan saying it should try to
improve its internal situation rather than resort to firing and shelling villages here."Their (Pakistan's) internal situation is very bad. Instead of disturbing your (border villagers) lives, they should have tried and concentrated to better their internal situation and their own lives... it would have got them better dividends," Omar said, addressing border villagers in Jora-farm today."What do they get from bombarding your houses? What do they get from killing you people? I cannot understand this," he said."It is unfortunate for you that the neighbouring countrydoesn't want to keep good relations with us due to some reasons," he said.Speaking to the people, he said, "It is difficult for you to save your own selves, children or animals. We can compensate you all... but cannot return the lives which perished in the shelling."Omar also said he did not have any political agenda in visiting the affected villages but was fulfilling his duty towards humanity prayed for the well being of the people.PTI
