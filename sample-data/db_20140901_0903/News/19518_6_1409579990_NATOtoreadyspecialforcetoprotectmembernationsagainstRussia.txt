NATO to ready special force to protect member nations against Russia NATO to ready special force to protect member nations against Russia 
					Brussels: NATO leaders this week will be asked to approve creation of a high-readiness force and the stockpiling of military equipment and supplies in Eastern Europe to help protect member nations there against potential Russian aggression, the alliance's secretary general said Monday."The Readiness Action Plan will ensure that we have the right forces and the right equipment in the right place, at the right time," Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. "Not because NATO wants to attack anyone. But because the dangers and the threats are more present and more visible. And we will do what it takes to defend our allies."President Barack Obama and leaders of NATO's other member countries open a summit Thursday in Wales that is expected to be dominated by how the US-led alliance should react over the long term to Russian actions toward Ukraine and the implications for security in Europe.Rasmussen told a news conference the proposed new force could be composed of several thousand troops contributed on a rotating basis by the 28 NATO countries.Backed by air and naval assets, the unit would be a "spearhead" that could be deployed at very short notice to help NATO members defend themselves against any threat, including Russia, Rasmussen said.Since the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia in March, Poland and other Eastern European members of NATO have demanded the alliance take a more active and high-profile role in their defense. Other allies, though, have been wary of doing anything that might endanger a 1997 agreement with Moscow under which NATO pledged not to base substantial forces in Eastern Europe on a permanent basis.The compromise NATO officials appear to have worked out is the pre-positioning of equipment and supplies in Eastern Europe "so this force can travel light, but strike hard if needed," in Rasmussen's words.AP
