Report: Former Iran Vice President Convicted Report: Former Iran Vice President Convicted 
A judiciary spokesman in Iran says a former vice president has been convicted of a charge that includes a prison term and a cash fine, without elaborating.

The semi-official ISNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehei on Monday as saying the verdict against Mohammad Reza Rahimi is not finalized.

Rahimi served as vice president to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran has 12 vice presidents but Rahimi was the most senior among them in Ahmadinejad's government.

In 2010, some of Ahmadinejad's political foes alleged Rahimi had a part in a major government embezzlement scheme, without releasing details. In March, local Iranian media reported Rahimi had been indicted, though details of the indictment were unclear. Rahimi has said he is innocent.
