William Pooley, 29, a volunteer nurse, was the first Briton infected in the West African outbreak.Pooley tested positive for Ebola while working at a clinic in Sierra Leone. He was flown home Sunday and placed in an isolation unit. He took his first dose of ZMapp on Monday, Royal Free Hospital said. The two Americans, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, were declared free of Ebola after they took ZMapp. The government of Liberia said this week that a doctor there had died of Ebola despite being given the drug.
