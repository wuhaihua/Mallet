Three people were killed and two others critically wounded in a shooting in a residential neighborhood in south Kansas City on Tuesday afternoon, and police located a missing SUV hours later several miles away.

Kansas City police spokeswoman Sgt. Kari Thompson said two of the victims were killed in one location, one was killed at another and the two people who were wounded were found at a third location, all in the same middle-class cul-de-sac. The missing SUV came from one of the homes where the shootings happened.

Nearly five hours after police were called to the scene shortly before 1 p.m., patrol cars and ambulances remained on the street near the crime scene.

Thompson declined to provide details of the victims or the suspect, who remained at large Tuesday night.

A 2002 Toyota Highlander that was missing from the scene was found by police shortly before 7 p.m. in a commercial area in the northern part of the city.

Thompson said investigators don't have a motive for the midday shootings.

"We don't see any rhyme or reason," she said. "That's what makes it so tough."

Police blocked off the street near the crime scene for nearly a half-mile in both directions, and officers on ATVs slowly searching the roadside grass for clues.

Earlier in the afternoon, officers went door-to-door talking to neighbors but said there was no indication of a danger to the public.
