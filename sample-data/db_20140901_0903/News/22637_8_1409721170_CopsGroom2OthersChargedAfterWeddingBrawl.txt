A western Pennsylvania groom spent his wedding night in the back of a police car after allegedly harassing a waitress at the reception then resisting arrest after an altercation with the pregnant woman's boyfriend.

A criminal complaint says groom Mark Williams touched the waitress several times during the wedding cruise and tried to pour alcohol down her throat. Police say he then scuffled with the woman's boyfriend after the boat docked early Monday morning.

Williams faces charges including riot, harassment and resisting arrest. He declined comment to reporters outside court Monday.

Authorities say Williams' off-duty state trooper brother assaulted two Pittsburgh police officers who were called to the scene. A state police spokeswoman confirmed a trooper was arrested during the incident.

A third man also faces charges.
