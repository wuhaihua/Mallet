9 People Hurt in 50-Car Pileup in Washington State 9 People Hurt in 50-Car Pileup in Washington State 
 

Authorities say nine people were hurt in an interstate pileup involving about 50 cars during a dust storm Saturday in southeastern Washington.

The Tri-City Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1rHHJIk) that the nine people were taken to nearby hospitals, but none had life-threatening injuries.

Capt. Devin Helland of Benton Fire District 1 says most of the crashes were rear-end collisions and spin-outs that were hit by other vehicles as dust reduced visibility. The collisions happened on Interstate 82, between the Highway 395 entrance, just south of Kennewick, and the Locust Grove overpass.

The crashes started around 3:30 p.m. as dust blew from west of the interstate. Law enforcement officers and the Washington State Department of Transportation blocked traffic from entering the interstate.

The interstate reopened a few hours later.
