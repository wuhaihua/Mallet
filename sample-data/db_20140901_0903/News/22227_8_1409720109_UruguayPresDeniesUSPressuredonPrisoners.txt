Uruguay Pres Denies US Pressured on Prisoners Uruguay Pres Denies US Pressured on Prisoners 
Uruguayan President Jose Mujica is denying that he has been pressured by the United States to let six men being held at the U.S. Navy Base in Guantanamo, Cuba resettle in the South American country.

He also says he will personally make the final decision over when the prisoners come to Uruguay.

Mujica spoke during a news conference on Tuesday.

Presidential spokesman Diego Canepa said Monday that undisclosed issues still have to be resolved before a transfer occurs. He says such a transfer is unlikely to occur before Oct. 26 presidential and legislative elections.

The six men approved for transfer to Uruguay — four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian — have not been charged with a crime and officials say they do not pose a threat.
