A 7-year-old boy remained in a Sacramento, California, hospital Monday, two days after he was injured while target shooting, authorities said Monday. The boy's condition wasn't disclosed.The boy, whose identity also wasn't disclosed, was shooting a single-shot .22-caliber bolt-action youth rifle Saturday under his father's supervision at a shooting range on their property in Georgetown, about 40 miles northeast of Sacramento, the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Another man was also practicing with a larger-caliber rifle. The sheriff's office said that when the boy grabbed his chest and complained of pain, his father took him to the local fire station, where he was flown by helicopter to the Sacramento hospital.With public attention still focused on the case of a 9-year-old girl who accidentally killed a shooting instructor while firing an Uzi in Arizona last week, the sheriff's office stressed that no one at the scene saw any inappropriate behavior or ricochets Saturday.IN-DEPTHToo Young to Shoot?
