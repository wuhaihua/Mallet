Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called on Ukraine to immediately start talks on a political solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine.

The Italian newspaper La Repubblica quoted the Russian president on Monday as saying he could &quot;take Kiev in two weeks&quot; during a telephone conversation with European Commission President Jose Manual Barroso. But speaking to Russia’s state-run news agency Itar-Tass on Tuesday, a Kremlin foreign policy aide said the conversation was &quot;taken out of the context and had a very different meaning.&quot; He added that if Barroso had disclosed details of the conversation, it would be &quot;incorrect and goes beyond the bounds of diplomatic practices.&quot;The phone call came as Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey wrote on Facebook: &quot;A great war has arrived at our doorstep - the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two.&quot; Russia’s foreign ministry responded by saying it was &quot;hard to believe that such statements can be made by the defense minister of a civilized state.&quot;IN-DEPTHUkraine Slams Russia's 'Direct and Open Aggression'Ukraine: Russia-Backed Rebels Fired on Border Guard VesselIs Putin Testing American Leadership?- Alexander Smith
