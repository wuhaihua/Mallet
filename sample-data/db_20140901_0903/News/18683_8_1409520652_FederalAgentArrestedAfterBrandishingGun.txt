Federal Agent Arrested After Brandishing Gun Federal Agent Arrested After Brandishing Gun 
 

Police say an apparently drunk man arrested after allegedly brandishing a gun on a Burbank street is a federal agent.

According to a police statement, officers responded early Wednesday after someone reported being approached by a very drunk man who pulled out a handgun. The armed man directed the victim to follow him.

The victim managed to run off and the armed suspect was found by police less than a mile away.

Police say Andrew Leconte was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and brandishing a firearm.

Investigators later learned that Leconte is an agent with the United States Marshals Service.

Jail records show the 27-year-old was released after posting bail. It wasn't immediately known if he has an attorney.

The incident remains under investigation.

Marshals Service spokesman Dave Turk said Sunday that the agency doesn't comment on ongoing investigations.
