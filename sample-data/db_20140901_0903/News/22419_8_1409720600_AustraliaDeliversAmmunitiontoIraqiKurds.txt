Australia Delivers Ammunition to Iraqi Kurds Australia Delivers Ammunition to Iraqi Kurds 
A military transport jet has made Australia's first delivery of ammunition to besieged Kurdish forces in northern Iraq before returning without incident to a United Arab Emirates base.

Australia announced Sunday it would join the United States, Britain, Canada, France and Italy in delivering rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and assault rifle ammunition at the request of the U.S. and Iraqi governments.

An Australian Defense Force statement said Wednesday that the C-17 Globemaster flew to Tirana in Albania over the weekend where it was loaded before delivering the ammunition to the Kurdish town of Irbil via Baghdad.

It landed back at al-Minhad Air Base near Dubai.

The statement says: "The aircraft's crew has confirmed that no shots were fired at the aircraft and that their mission was carried out without incident."
