A lightning strike at a New York City beach has injured three people.

The fire department says the men were injured at Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday evening as bad storms rolled through the area.

The men are being treated at a hospital. The extent of their injuries is unknown.

The lightning strike happened as heavy thunderstorms swept through the city. Torrential rain, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations, halted play at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens and forced the early end to a musical festival on an East River island.

Dozens of commercial flights into the city's airports were delayed because of the severe weather.
