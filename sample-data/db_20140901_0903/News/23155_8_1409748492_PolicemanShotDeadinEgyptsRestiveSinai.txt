Policeman Shot Dead in Egypt's Restive Sinai Policeman Shot Dead in Egypt's Restive Sinai 
Gunmen shot dead an Egyptian off-duty policeman Wednesday in the restive north of the Sinai Peninsula, a security official said.

The official said the 32-year-old first sergeant was walking home after work when gunmen opened fire, killing him on the spot in el-Arish, the provincial capital. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

Over a dozen policemen have been shot in the same neighborhood, home to many policemen, since last summer.

Attacks have surged against police and soldiers in recent months as the government has sought to root out militants in northern Sinai. On Tuesday, 11 policemen were killed by a roadside bomb.

The country has been battling Islamic militants in the area for years, but the violence dramatically escalated after the military's ouster last July of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and its subsequent crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.

An al-Qaida-inspired group called Ansar Beit al-Maqdis has claimed responsibility for a series of explosions and suicide attacks over the past year, mostly targeting police officers and soldiers. The group claimed its attacks were revenge for the crackdown.

A senior militant from the group, Fayez Abu-Sheita, was killed Sunday. He was suspected of kidnapping soldiers and plotting attacks against state and security institutions. The official said authorities expect a rise in revenge attacks following Abu-Sheita's death.
