Joan Rivers' Family Keeping 'Our Fingers Crossed' Joan Rivers' Family Keeping 'Our Fingers Crossed' 
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.

                                        
                                        
                                            
                                        
                                                                Joan Rivers Still Unconscious

"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today. "We are keeping our fingers crossed."

Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday after an emergency call that she was in cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.

Doctors are intentionally keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they're more comfortable with her condition, which remains "serious."

Reaction has been widespread, including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
