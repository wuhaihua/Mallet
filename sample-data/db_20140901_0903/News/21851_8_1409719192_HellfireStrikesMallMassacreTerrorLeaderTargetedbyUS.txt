Few details were available about the operation, which came a day after the Islamist rebels attacked government facilities in the capital, Mogadishu.Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary, said in a statement late Monday only that &quot;we are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate.&quot; But U.S. officials told NBC News that a military drone launched Hellfire missiles at at least two vehicles in a remote area of southern Somalia, with al-Shabaab's top leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, believed to have been the target. Military and intelligence officials were still working Monday night to confirm who may have been killed.Al-Shabaab seized much of southern Somalia in 2006 before Somali forces and African peacekeeping troops ousted it five years later. The rebels, who still hold some towns, attacked a prison where dozens of its members are held on Sunday, with unconfirmed reports that 10 people were killed.IN-DEPTH10 Things to Know About Somali Militants al-ShabaabAl-Shabaab Terrorists Kill 10 in Somali Parliament ExplosionSOCIALâ€” Jim Miklaszewski, Courtney Kube and M.
