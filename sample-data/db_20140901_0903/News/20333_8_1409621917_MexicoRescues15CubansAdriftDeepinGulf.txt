Mexico Rescues 15 Cubans Adrift Deep in Gulf Mexico Rescues 15 Cubans Adrift Deep in Gulf 
The Mexican Navy says it has rescued 13 badly dehydrated Cubans who were drifting in a makeshift boat far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.

One of those taken from the boat died while being taken for treatment. Another one of the 15 on the boat was found dead on the craft.

The Navy said Monday it rescued the Cubans at a point about 133 miles (246 kilometers) north of Puerto Progreso, Yucatan.

A fishing boat had sighted the homemade craft, which Navy personnel said appeared to have been made partly of wood.

Most of the remaining Cubans were taken for treatment to Puerto Progreso, Yucatan. Two women were taken to another hospital for treatment of more serious problems.

Mexico usually repatriates Cubans picked up at sea.
