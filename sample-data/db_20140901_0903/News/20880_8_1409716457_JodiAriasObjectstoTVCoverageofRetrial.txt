Stephens already limited media coverage of the trial and ordered that no video be aired until the retrial is over. A motion on behalf of television stations seeks to allow coverage to be aired 30 minutes after court ends, KPNX reported.Arias, 34, was convicted last year of murder in the stabbing death of her lover, Travis Alexander, in Mesa, Arizona in 2008. Jurors couldn’t reach a decision on sentencing, and the retrial will bring in a new jury to decide whether she should be given the death penalty.IN-DEPTHUnwanted Lawyer Ordered to Stay on Jodi Arias CaseJodi Arias Changes Ming on Representing HerselfJodi Arias Fails in New Try at Avoiding Death Penalty
