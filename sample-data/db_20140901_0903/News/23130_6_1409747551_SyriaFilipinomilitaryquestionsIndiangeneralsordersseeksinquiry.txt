Syria: Filipino military questions Indian general's orders, seeks inquiry Syria: Filipino military questions Indian general's orders, seeks inquiry 
					The Indian Army may be in for some&nbsp;embarrassment after&nbsp;Philippines has reportedly&nbsp;demanded an investigation against UNDOF commander Lieutenant General Iqbal Singh Singha, who is heading the multi-national&nbsp;troop force in Golan Heights, for allegedly&nbsp;putting&nbsp;Filipino soldiers in harm's way.On 28 August, Syrian rebels reportedly took a group of Fijian peacekeepers hostage and later surrounded the encampments of Filipino peacekeepers in the Golan Heights.The rebels demanded the surrender of Filipino troops which was immediately refused by them, despite orders from Lt Gen Singha who wanted them to raise the white flag and drop their arms. The Filipino soldiers were backed&nbsp;from their own army commanders and it&nbsp;reportedly sparked a 7-hour long gun battle between the two sides.A Rappler report said&nbsp;despite being told to lay down their arms to ensure the safety of Fijian peacekeepers, the troops refused to and managed to&nbsp;walk with arms and ammunition to the next UN encampment during a lull in fighting in the night.Clearly expressing disappointment at the role played by the Indian general, Philippines Armed Forces chief General Gregorio Catapang Jr said that he wanted the UNDOF commander investigated for allegedly taking life-threatening decisions regarding the Filipino soldiers."First, in the terms of reference, it was not indicated there that we can be ordered to surrender our firearms. The UNDOF commander wanted to save the Fijians at the expense of the Philippines," Catapang Jr told reporters on Monday, the&nbsp;Rappler reported.Incidentally the Fijian troops are still to be released, prompting questions over whether the Filipino troops' choice was a prudent one, despite the danger it put them in.Fijians this week have been holding candlelight vigils for their troops, reportedly 45 in number, who have been held by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in an unknown location since 28 August. The UN says it's negotiating with the insurgents, who have made several demands for releasing the Fijians, including being taken off the UN terrorist list.Incidentally, Lieutenant General Singha happens to be the father of MTV and reality television star Ranvijay.
