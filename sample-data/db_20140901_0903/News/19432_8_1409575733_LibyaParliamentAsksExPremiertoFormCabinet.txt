Libya Parliament Asks Ex-Premier to Form Cabinet Libya Parliament Asks Ex-Premier to Form Cabinet 
Libya's official news agency says the country's elected parliament has tasked the recently resigned prime minister with forming a new government.

LANA says the parliament convening in Tobruk voted Monday to name Abdullah al-Thinni as the new head of an 18-portfolio Cabinet, of which seven ministries would participate in a "crisis" grouping. The agency didn't elaborate.

Al-Thinni resigned Wednesday, saying he hoped a new government would be more inclusive. Al-Thinni's government was at odds with an alliance of Islamist militants who took over the capital, Tripoli, from rival groups after weeks of fighting. The outgoing parliament, led by Islamists, has refused to recognize the newly elected body that convenes in the east. It has also separately named a new prime minister to form a "national salvation government."
