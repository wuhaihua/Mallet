A top United Nations human rights official said last week that the total death toll in the five-month conflict - including civilians, Ukrainian forces and separatists - was nearly 2,600.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Sunday for immediate talks on the &quot;statehood&quot; of southern and eastern Ukraine, although his spokesman said this did not mean Moscow now endorsed rebel calls for independence for territory they have seized. Putin later said he hoped &quot;common sense&quot; would prevail in the West over the possibility of imposing additional sanctions, Russian news agency Interfax reported on Monday.IN-DEPTHUkraine: Russia-Backed Rebels Fired on Border Guard VesselIs Putin Testing American Leadership?Sen.
