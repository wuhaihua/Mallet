Calais Mayor Might Close Port to Stop Migrants Calais Mayor Might Close Port to Stop Migrants 
The mayor of Calais is considering closing the French city's lucrative port if Britain doesn't make a "strong gesture" to control a growing tide of migrants trying to sneak across the English Channel.

Natacha Bouchart's threat Tuesday comes amid mounting tensions in Calais and a Europe-wide debate over how to cope with rising immigration.

Calais is the stepping stone for migrants from poor countries in the Mideast, Asia and Africa who are trying to reach Britain, which they see as an Eldorado.

Bouchard told reporters in Paris that the migrants are draining the coffers of Calais and making life difficult for residents.

She wants Britain to revise its legislation on migrants and come to Calais to take stock of the problem, or she could decide "to block the port."
