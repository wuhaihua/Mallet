NY Police Boss Defends Response in Custody Death NY Police Boss Defends Response in Custody Death 
 

New York Police Department Commissioner William Bratton says it appears officers behaved appropriately in the custody death of a man who was high on drugs.

Ronald Singleton's death was ruled a homicide Friday. The medical examiner's office says "physical restrain by police" was a factor, along with severe intoxication from the hallucinogenic drug PCP.

Police say Singleton was acting erratically in a taxi July 13 when officers responding to an emergency call placed him in a protective body wrap.

Bratton on Monday stressed the term "homicide" is a medical definition and doesn't mean an officer did something wrong. He says the officers were trying to protect Singleton from hurting himself and others.

Prosecutors are investigating. The police department will then do an investigation.

Singleton's death came days before a videotaped chokehold by police left another man dead.
