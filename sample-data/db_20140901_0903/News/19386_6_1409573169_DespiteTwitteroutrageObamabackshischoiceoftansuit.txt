Despite Twitter outrage, Obama backs his choice of  tan suit Despite Twitter outrage, Obama backs his choice of  tan suit 
					US President Barrack Obama isn't&nbsp;used to following convention but his recent choice of attire, a tan-coloured suit,&nbsp;elicited a range of responses on Twitter not all of which was to praise his fashion sense.Here are some of the reactions:A Republican congressman actually got very upset with Obama. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday,&rdquo; Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said on NewsMaxTV as quoted by Huffingtonpost.Obama rarely ever wears anything other dark suits, and his tan suit was not outstanding either. It's not clear yet why it was such an unsuitable choice of attire to address a news conference on Iran and Ukraine.Obama wasn't willing to yield on his fashion choices either and White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest told reporters, "The President stands squarely behind his decision to wear his tan suit."Even some of the American press told detractors to give it a rest."Let&rsquo;s make this much clear: there is nothing wrong, wild or crazy about a tan suit. This may come as a shock to those who expressed outrage at President Obama&rsquo;s choice of attire yesterday, but not all suits come in a shade of gray or navy," said Time magazine.Women's website Mamamia posted a rather cheeky article with the headline "President Obama just found out what it's like to be a woman."The fashion industry, though, also had Obama's back. Joseph Abboud, fashion designer with Men's Wearhouse told Huffingtonpost in an interview, "Wearing a tan suit in August is hardly a fashion faux-pas and it has been a seasonal part of men's business dress code for around 75 years."As it turns out, Obama is not the only US president to have donned a tan suit. In 1981 President Ronald Reagan also wore it.
