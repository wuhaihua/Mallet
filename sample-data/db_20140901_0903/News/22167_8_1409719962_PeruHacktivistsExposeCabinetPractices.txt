They helped precipitate a no-confidence vote last week that the Cabinet barely survived.They dumped online an estimated 3,500 emails of then-Prime Minister Rene Cornejo.The hackers are a homegrown version of the U.S. and U.K-based LulzSec &quot;black hat&quot; hacker collective that grew out of the Anonymous movement. They are believed to be two young men.While police pressure and arrests have diminished or driven a lot of &quot;hacktivism&quot; from the U.S. and western Europe underground, hackers in Latin America &quot;never really stopped,&quot; said Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.Of them, LulzSecPeru is widely considered the region's most skillful and accomplished hacktivist team, said Camilo Galdos, a Peruvian digital security expert.
