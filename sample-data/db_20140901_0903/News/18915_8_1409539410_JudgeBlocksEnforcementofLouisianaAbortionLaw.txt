A Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit claims doctors haven't had enough time to obtain privileges and the law likely would force Louisiana's five abortion clinics to close.DeGravelles says the doctors' risk of fines and losing licenses outweighs any injury to the state from keeping the status quo. He noted the state health secretary says she won't enforce the law against doctors who've applied to hospitals but have no decision.IN-DEPTHCourt Keeps Mississippi's Last Abortion Clinic OpenFederal Judge Halts Key Part of Restrictive Texas Abortion Law- The Associated Press
