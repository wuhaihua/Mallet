The group, Future User, says the video, called "Clockwork," is about "police militarization." It was posted online Monday and also includes a clip of Eric Garner, who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold, shots of Trayvon Martin and his killer George Zimmerman, and several scenes of police brutality.

McEnroe said he got involved in the project through a friend, and called it "an experience I'll never forget," according to a press release.

McEnroe has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.

In the video, the tennis star loses a match and then is kidnapped, tied to a bench and tortured.
