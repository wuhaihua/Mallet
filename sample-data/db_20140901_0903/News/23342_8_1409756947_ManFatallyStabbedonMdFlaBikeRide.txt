Man Fatally Stabbed on Md.-Fla. Bike Ride Man Fatally Stabbed on Md.-Fla. Bike Ride 
 

Police say a Connecticut man who was biking from Maryland to Miami to propose to his girlfriend was fatally stabbed by a homeless man outside a McDonald's restaurant.

The Vero Beach News Journal (         http://bit.ly/1vMytn3 ) reports that 28-year-old Kevin Adorno stopped at the restaurant Monday night and was talking to his girlfriend on a cellphone when he was attacked.

Witnesses say Adorno stumbled into the restaurant. One person started administering aid while another called 911. He was pronounced dead a short time later.

Officers arrested 59-year-old Rene Herrera Cruz at a Burger King across the street. He is charged with first-degree murder. Cruz told officers he thought Adorno was directing people by cellphone to attack him.

Police Chief David Currey says the trip was a "bucket list" item for Adorno.
