Princeton Worker Told to Choose Medical Pot or Job Princeton Worker Told to Choose Medical Pot or Job 
 

A Princeton University employee says he has been told to choose between medical marijuana and his job.

Don DeZarn says Princeton officials told him he couldn't use medicinal marijuana and work in his job as senior operations manager of campus dining.

The 48-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, who is running as a New Jersey congressional candidate for the Legalize Marijuana Party, says he qualifies for medical marijuana because of his inflammatory bowel disease and PTSD.

DeZarn says that after discussing with school officials Tuesday how they might accommodate him under federal law, he was told not to show for work for now.

Employers do not have to accommodate medical marijuana use in the workplace under New Jersey law.

A Princeton spokesman said the university doesn't comment on personnel matters.
