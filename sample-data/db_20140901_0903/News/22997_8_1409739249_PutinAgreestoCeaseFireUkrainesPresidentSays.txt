The brief statement on Wednesday said &quot;mutual understanding was reached regarding the steps that will contribute to the establishment of peace&quot; but gave no details. There was no immediate reaction from the Russia-backed separatists whom Ukrainian forces have been fighting since April. The rebels ignored a 10-day unilateral cease-fire that Poroshenko had called in June.Putin's spokesman said earlier that the Russian president and Poroshenko had found in a recent discussion that they &quot;largely share views&quot; on ways out of the crisis. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to support pro-Russian insurgents who have been fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine since mid-April. Moscow has vehemently denied this charge. President Barack Obama arrived in Estonia Wednesday morning in a show of solidarity with NATO allies who fear they could be the next target of Russia's aggression.IN-DEPTHFive Shells Land Nearby and 'Nobody Bats an Eyelid'Did Putin Say Russia Could 'Take Kiev in Two Weeks'?NATO Plans Rapid-Response Force to Thwart Russia- The Associated Press
