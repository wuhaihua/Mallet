Iran has unveiled a new surface-to-air missile and two radar systems it claims will boost the country's defense capabilities.

Air defense chief Gen. Farzad Esmaili says the missile will enable Iranian forces to "shoot down any hostile target," even at high altitudes.

He says the Talash-3, or Endeavor-3 missile was successfully test-fired recently.  Esmaili's speech was broadcast on state TV Tuesday.

The general also inaugurated two radar systems â€” Arash-2, tasked with detecting miniature drones at a distance of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and also Kayhan, said to be capable of detecting cruise missiles and drones.

Tehran regularly announces military advances that cannot be independently verified.

It has surface-to-surface missiles with a range of about 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), enough to reach Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.
