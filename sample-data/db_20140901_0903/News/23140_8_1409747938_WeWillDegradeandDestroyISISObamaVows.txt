Its release followed the murder of James Foley, who had also been held hostage by the Sunni extremists. The president said that Sotloff &quot;deeply loved the Islamic world&quot; and had risked his life traveling in the Middle East to &quot;tell the story of Muslim men and women demanding dignity.&quot; He added: &quot;Steven’s life stood in sharp contrast to those that murdered him so brutally.&quot;IN-DEPTHISIS Beheads Second American, Monitoring Group SaysMoney, Land, Revenge: What do ISIS Extremists Really Want?Read Steven Sotloff's Best Reporting for TIMESOCIAL- F.
