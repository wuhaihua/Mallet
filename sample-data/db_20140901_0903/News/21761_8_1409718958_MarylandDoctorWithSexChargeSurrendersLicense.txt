Maryland Doctor With Sex Charge Surrenders License Maryland Doctor With Sex Charge Surrenders License 
 

A Maryland physician at the center of a medical licensing scandal is surrendering his license to practice medicine to resolve charges that he molested a female patient.

Attorneys for Dr. William Dando and the Allegany County State's Attorney's office announced the deal at a court hearing Tuesday in Cumberland.

Dando declined to comment. His trial had been scheduled for Wednesday.

The 60-year-old doctor had pleaded not guilty to fourth-degree sex offense. He was accused of molesting a woman at a clinic. A West Virginia woman also filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Dando sexually assaulted her.

The state public health agency's inspector general is investigating how Dando obtained a Maryland medical license in 1996 despite his 1987 conviction for raping a woman at gunpoint near Orlando, Florida.
