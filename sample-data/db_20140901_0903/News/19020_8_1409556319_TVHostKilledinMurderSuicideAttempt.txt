Scott Rogers, 52, who immigrated to the U.S. from England in the mid-1990s and hosted the &quot;Around Town&quot; show on WAFB-TV in Baton Rouge, was found dead in his St. Gabriel bed on Wednesday. His alleged killer, son-in-law Mathew Hodgkinson, was nearby, suffering from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.Investigators believe Hodgkinson, 36, wrote a note left at the bedside table that seemed to allude to a motive: a recent move by federal agents to remove two boys, an adopted son and a boy Rogers planned to adopt, from Rogers' home. “They broke our happy, loving home,&quot; the note said. &quot;They do not get to take Scott too.”Iberville County Sheriff Brett Stassi has told reporters that the two men were in a relationship, and that Hodgkinson's marriage to Rogers' daughter appeared to be a cover and a way to keep Hodgkinson from being deported. While authorities try to sort out the tangled story, Hodgkinson was on life support from a brain injury, Stassi has said.—Jon Schuppe
