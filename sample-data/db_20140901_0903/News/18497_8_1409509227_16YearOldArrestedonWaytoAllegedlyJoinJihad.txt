Cazeneuve said in a statement that border police at the Nice airport arrested the girl Saturday before her departure &quot;for jihad.&quot; A man about age 20 was later arrested on suspicion of being her recruiter and of purchasing her airline ticket to Turkey in order to reach Syria. The girl's family was not aware of her intentions, Cazeneuve said.Thousands of foreign fighters, many from Western Europe, have joined extremist Islamist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, according to U.S. and European intelligence estimates. France estimates that 800 of its citizen have left to join Islamist groups in Syria. Cazeneuve unveiled measures in April to try to prevent young French Muslims and others from becoming radicalized, including a hotline set up for parents to signal suspicious behavior in their children. Authorities have received nearly 300 tips, the statement said, 45 percent of which involved women or young girls.
