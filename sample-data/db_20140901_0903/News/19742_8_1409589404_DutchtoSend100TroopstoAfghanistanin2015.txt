Dutch to Send 100 Troops to Afghanistan in 2015 Dutch to Send 100 Troops to Afghanistan in 2015 
The Dutch government says it plans to send 100 troops to northern Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission due to start in 2015, when the alliance's combat mission in the war-weary nation ends.

The Dutch Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday the Dutch contingent would be made up of trainers, medical personnel, transport and security staff and a logistics unit.  It will be based in the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif and will have an "advisory role in the highest echelons of the army and police."

Dutch troops will be part of NATO's Resolute Support mission, the successor to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which winds down at the end of the year.
