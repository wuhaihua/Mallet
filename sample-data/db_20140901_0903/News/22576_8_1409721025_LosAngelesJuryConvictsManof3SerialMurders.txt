A Los Angeles jury has convicted a career criminal in the serial killings of three women in the 1980s.

The jury on Tuesday found 74-year-old Samuel Little guilty of three counts of murder.

The victims were 41-year-old Carol Alford, whose body was found on July 13, 1987; 35-year-old Audrey Nelson, found on Aug. 14, 1989; and 46-year-old Guadalupe Apodaca, found on Sept. 3, 1989.

The prosecution was made possible by advances in DNA technology. Little was arrested in 2012 after detectives from Los Angeles found him living in Kentucky.

Prosecutor Beth Silverman has said Little is likely responsible for at least 40 killings nationwide dating back to 1980. Authorities in California, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, Mississippi and Ohio are scouring their cold-case files for possible ties to Little.
