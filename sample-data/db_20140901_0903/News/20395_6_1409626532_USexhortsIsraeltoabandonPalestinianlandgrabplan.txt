US exhorts Israel to abandon Palestinian land-grab plan US exhorts Israel to abandon Palestinian land-grab plan 
					Washington: Israel has faced increasing&nbsp;pressure, including from the United States, after saying it&nbsp;plans to expropriate 400 hectares (988 acres) of Palestinian&nbsp;land in the Bethlehem area in the south of the occupied West&nbsp;Bank.&nbsp;Ally Washington, the United Nations and Egypt all called&nbsp;for an urgent rethink after Sunday's announcement, which&nbsp;angered the Palestinians and alarmed Israeli peace&nbsp;campaigners, and comes days after a long-term ceasefire
between Israel and the Palestinians took hold.According to the Israeli military, the land move was a&nbsp;political decision made after the June killing of three&nbsp;Israeli teenagers snatched in the same area, known to Israelis&nbsp;as the Gush Etzion settlement bloc.&nbsp;"This announcement, like every other settlement&nbsp;announcement Israel makes, planning step they approve, and&nbsp;construction tender they issue, is counterproductive to&nbsp;Israel's stated goal of a negotiated two-state solution with&nbsp;the Palestinians," a US State Department official said&nbsp;yesterday."We urge the government of Israel to reverse this&nbsp;decision."&nbsp;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of&nbsp;settlement expansion on land the Palestinians claim for a&nbsp;future state is deemed illegal by the European Union and an&nbsp;"obstacle to peace" by the United States.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was "alarmed" by Israel's&nbsp;plans, his spokesman said.&nbsp;"The seizure of such a large swathe of land risks paving&nbsp;the way for further settlement activity, which -- as the&nbsp;United Nations has reiterated on many occasions -- is illegal&nbsp;under international law and runs totally counter to the&nbsp;pursuit of a two-state solution," the spokesman said."The secretary-general calls on Israel to heed the calls&nbsp;of the international community to refrain from settlement&nbsp;activity and abide by its commitments under international&nbsp;law..."&nbsp;Egypt -- which last week mediated a permanent truce&nbsp;between Israel and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip to end a&nbsp;50-day war -- denounced Israel's move."This is not a positive step -- it contradicts&nbsp;international law and will have negative consequences on the&nbsp;peace process," a foreign ministry statement in Cairo said.&nbsp;The foreign ministry did not mention the Gaza truce talks,&nbsp;but insisted that Israel's planned West Bank land grab would&nbsp;be "an obstacle" to a two-state solution between Israel and&nbsp;the Palestinians.Rights watchdog Amnesty International similarly denounced&nbsp;the Israeli plans, saying that it "appears to be the largest&nbsp;land grab in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1980".&nbsp;"Israel's strategy of illegally confiscating land for&nbsp;settlements in the West Bank must stop once and for all," said
Amnesty's Philip Luther.&nbsp;The Palestinians have called for diplomatic action against&nbsp;Israel, while Israeli peace campaigners said the land&nbsp;expropriation is the biggest of its kind in three decades.AFP
