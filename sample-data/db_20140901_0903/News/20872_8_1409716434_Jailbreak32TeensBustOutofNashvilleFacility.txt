Thirty-two teens — ages 14 to 19 — escaped from Woodland Hills Youth Development Center around 11 p.m. Monday by crawling under a weak spot in a fence that surrounded a yard there, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said. Two teens were recaptured right away and others were found overnight, Johnson said.Local police and the Tennessee Highway Patrol are taking part in the search for the teens still at large. The teens being kept at the detention center have committed at least three felonies, Johnson said. The escape happened when a large group of teens at the center went out into the yard all at once shortly after a shift change, Johnson said. He said he didn't know if the escape was planned or spontaneous.&quot;Staffing is lighter during the overnight hours, and so, presumably, they planned for that, but we don't know quite yet,&quot; Johnson told NBC News affiliate WSMV. He said that most of the teens have at least three felonies on their criminal records.IN-DEPTHSearch continues for 17 of 32 teens who escaped from youth correctional facility (WSMV)SOCIAL— The Associated Press
