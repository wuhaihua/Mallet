A Florida judge who gained an international audience while presiding over Casey Anthony's murder trial is retiring from the bench, but not from the courtroom.

Just days after officially resigning his post as the chief judge of Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit where he served nearly 25 years as a judge, Belvin Perry announced Monday that he's headed back to private practice and joining the Morgan and Morgan Law Firm.

The 64-year-old Perry gained fame while presiding over Anthony's 2011 murder trial. He becomes the latest prominent Florida name to join the Morgan firm, which also includes gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist.

Perry says he is looking forward to being back in the courtroom trying cases. Before his post on the bench Perry spent several years as a prosecutor.
