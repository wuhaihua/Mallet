Jet With Cracked Windshield Returns to Los Angeles Jet With Cracked Windshield Returns to Los Angeles 
 

An American Airlines jet bound for North Texas has safely returned to Los Angeles International Airport after the front windshield cracked.

American spokesman Paul Flaningan said Tuesday that nobody on Flight 2448 to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport was hurt.

Flaningan says the Boeing 757 took off Monday afternoon but within minutes the pilot noticed a windshield crack. Flaningan says authorities are trying to determine what caused the crack and that there's no preliminary indication of a bird strike.

He says the jet carrying 184 passengers and a five-person crew returned to Los Angeles. Passengers boarded another American jet and were on their way about 90 minutes later.

Flaningan says the windshield-damaged jet was taken out of service for repairs.
