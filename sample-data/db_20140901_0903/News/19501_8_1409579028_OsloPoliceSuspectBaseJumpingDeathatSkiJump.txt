Oslo Police Suspect Base Jumping Death at Ski Jump Oslo Police Suspect Base Jumping Death at Ski Jump 
Norwegian police say they suspect that a base jumper was killed at the Holmenkollen ski jump in the capital, Oslo.

Egil Kulseth from the Oslo Police says a Norwegian man, wearing a base jumping suit and equipment, was found dead at the bottom of the ski jump on Sunday evening after passers-by alerted rescue services.

The ski jump tower at Holmenkollen, a popular venue for international competitions, is about 60 meters (200 feet) above the ground.

Kulseth said Monday that police were investigating the case as a suspicious death, but said they had no evidence any others were involved. He declined to further identify the jumper or give more information.
