Police in Oregon Say Scene 'Safe' After Standoff Police in Oregon Say Scene 'Safe' After Standoff 
 

Police have detained a man after a brief standoff near Interstate 84 in northeast Portland, Oregon.

Sgt. Pete Simpson of the Portland Police Bureau said Monday afternoon the scene is now "safe." Authorities had earlier closed a section of the highway after a man with a gun was spotted and officers tried to negotiate with him.

The man's uncle told KOIN-TV (http://is.gd/15jYpW) his nephew has mental health issues.

Simpson says shots were fired during the incident, but he did not immediately say whether they were fired by the suspect, police or both.

No officers were hurt.

The freeway remains closed as authorities investigate.
