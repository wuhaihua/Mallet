Police say a speeding car slammed into a tree after losing control along a Dallas roadway, killing all six people inside.

Dallas police officer Monica Cordova says the crash occurred Sunday night in a residential area in southeast Dallas. The victims were two teenage boys, two men and two women ranging in age from 15 to 23.

Cordova says the 20-year-old driver lost control as the road curved when the back passenger-side tire of the Chevrolet Impala hit a curb. The vehicle slid across three lanes before hitting a tree in the median.

Investigators say four people died at the scene, while two others died at a hospital.

Cordova says speed was a factor in the crash, but not alcohol.
