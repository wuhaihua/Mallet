Modi Promises Red Carpet for Japan Firms in India Modi Promises Red Carpet for Japan Firms in India 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is wooing Japanese businesses with a promise of "red carpet" treatment rather than the bureaucratic red tape India is notorious for.

Modi told Japanese business leaders Tuesday that India is the best possible investment destination, where they can find "democracy, demography and demand," in the market of nearly 1.3 billion people.

Modi will wrap up his five-day visit to Japan on Wednesday, bringing home pledges of billions of dollars in aid and investment after the two governments agreed to beef up their economic and security ties.

The slew of agreements signed by Modi and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not include a nuclear energy pact India needs for imports of Japanese equipment to ramp up nuclear power.
