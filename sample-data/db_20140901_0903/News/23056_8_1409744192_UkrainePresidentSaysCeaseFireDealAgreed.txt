Ukraine President Says Cease-Fire Deal Agreed Ukraine President Says Cease-Fire Deal Agreed 
The office of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin are in agreement on a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, but the statement was ambiguous and there was no immediate indication that the fighting would stop.

The brief statement Wednesday said "mutual understanding was reached regarding the steps that will contribute to the establishment of peace" but gave no details.

Poroshenko's office first said that there was "agreement on a permanent cease-fire," but later revised the statement to say "agreement on a cease-fire regime." The changes appeared in Ukrainian, Russian and English-language versions issued by the office.

That appeared to indicate an agreement on conditions necessary for a cease-fire, not that one would imminently be implemented.
