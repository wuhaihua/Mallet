Scottish Zoo: 'Bad News' for Pregnant Giant Panda Scottish Zoo: 'Bad News' for Pregnant Giant Panda 
A Scottish zoo has sounded warnings that a female giant panda may have lost her cub.

Hopes were high that Tian Tian, or Sweetie, would give birth over the weekend following artificial insemination in April.

But the zoo's panda expert Iain Valentine said Monday that Tian Tian is "now past her due date," and hormone tests showed that "something may be amiss."

Many thought it could be third time lucky for the panda, which failed to mate with male companion Yang Guang, or Sunshine, despite encouragement from zoo keepers. She became pregnant last year, also after artificial insemination, but appeared to suffer a miscarriage late term.

Valentine said there is still a chance the panda will give birth, and experts are monitoring her closely.
