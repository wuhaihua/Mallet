The Islamic State (IS) has allegedly beheaded the second US journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, according to the monitoring group SITE Intel, which posted the information on its website on 02 September 2014. The IS militant group, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, has demanded and collected ransom payments for European journalists and other hostages. The USA and Britain, meanwhile, have refused to negotiate with the terrorists.  EPA/MAZEN MAHDI

War correspondent Janine di Giovanni paid tribute to the “smart” and “extremely funny” 31-year-old Florida native, who was beheaded by militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).Sotloff was a “very dedicated journalist” who “cared about the story,&quot; di Giovanni added. &quot;He was a very good writer. I think before Steve went back [to Syria] he had some misgivings and some doubts but he was very anxious to work on long-term projects, some projects that concerned human rights and that could make a difference... he was a very special guy.” The White House confirmed on Wednesday that a video showing Sotloff's beheading was authentic. Di Giovanni added: “We have to remember the local people. It’s not just the international reporters that are being killed by ISIS, there are local journalists that are being killed as well, they are just not getting the publicity.”IN-DEPTHU.S. Will ‘Degrade and Destroy’ ISIS Militants, Obama SaysMoney, Land, Revenge: What do ISIS Extremists Really Want?Read Steven Sotloff's Best Reporting for TIMESOCIAL- Carol Grisanti and Alastair Jamieson
