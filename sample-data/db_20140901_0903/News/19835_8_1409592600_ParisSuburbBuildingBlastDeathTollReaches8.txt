Paris Suburb Building Blast Death Toll Reaches 8 Paris Suburb Building Blast Death Toll Reaches 8 
The death toll in the partial collapse of a four-story apartment building in a Paris suburb has risen to eight after emergency crews pulled the bodies of a man and a woman from the rubble.

Fire department spokesman Gabriel Plus said the bodies were found Monday in Rosny-sous-Boisa, a northeastern suburb.

Officials said there was no longer any danger in the neighborhood after the explosion sheared part of the building Sunday, scattering scraps of metal and household belongings.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a gas leak is believed to be the cause of the explosion.
