How You Can Help: Syrian Refugee Children How You Can Help: Syrian Refugee Children 
                            

According to the International Labour Organization, there are an estimated 180,000 to 300,000 child workers in Lebanon, many of them Syrian refugees.

Child labor is illegal in Lebanon but Syrian refugee children can be found everywhere, from agricultural fields to urban streets, selling everything from chewing gum to flowers and tissues.

These children, some as young as 7, and their families fled the conflict in Syria.

Many of the children are from middle class families and were in school in Syria but now they are the ones supporting their families. They wake up at 6 a.m., board a truck and head to the fields to spend hours doing back-breaking work.

UNICEF and Beyond Association work together to give the kids some schooling after their fieldwork and before they return to tents and their families.
