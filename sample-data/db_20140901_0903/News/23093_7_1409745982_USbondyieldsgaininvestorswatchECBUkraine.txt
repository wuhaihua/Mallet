												  U.S. Treasury yields continued to rise on Wednesday, as investors mulled this week's much-anticipated European Central Bank (ECB) meeting and the possibility of a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine.  Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were at 2.45 percent, up from a yield of 2.41 percent on Tuesday and 2.35 percent late on Friday.   Short-end yields continued to get pulled higher, with two-year notes yielding 0.54 percent on Wednesday.

Deutsche Bank Co-CEO Anshu Jain warned CNBC that such additional liquidity measures would achieve little.    "We're getting to the point where much more won't make a difference," Jain told CNBC at a banking conference in Frankfurt, Germany.    "The reality is, thanks to the ECB's actions which were required, low interest rates are a reality which will not go away any time soon."

									  Meanwhile, there was confusion surrounding a possible cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia.    Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office said an agreement had been reached with Russia's Vladimir Putin on a "permanent cease-fire" in eastern Ukraine. However, it toned down the statement after Russia denied the deal.Read MoreConfusion over eastern Ukraine cease-fireThe news came as U.S. President Barack Obama held a press conference in Estonia, and followed reports that the European Union would launch new sanctions against Russia by the end of the week.

The former are expected to show record growth of more than 10 percent on the month, with durable goods orders already known to have jumped by 22.6 percent in July, in part due to surging aircraft orders.    Domestic vehicle sales in July appear on track to have picked up further, and now stand at around pre-crisis levels.   U.S. stocks mostly fell on Tuesday, but the S&amp;P 500 held above 2,000 after hitting another intraday record.   â€”By CNBC's Katy Barnato
