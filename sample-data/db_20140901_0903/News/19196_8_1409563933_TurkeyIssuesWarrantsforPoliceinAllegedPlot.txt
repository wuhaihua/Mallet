Turkey Issues Warrants for Police in Alleged Plot Turkey Issues Warrants for Police in Alleged Plot 
Turkish authorities have issued arrest warrants for 33 police officers accused of plotting against the government.

Turkey's private Dogan news agency says the warrants were filed Monday for the officers, including the former head of a financial unit, on charges that include espionage.

Monday's move is part of a wave of arrests since July stemming from allegations by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that police conspired against him. It comes days after former Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu succeeded Erdogan as prime minister.

Erdogan has accused a U.S.-based spiritual leader, Fetullah Gulen, of infiltrating the police and judiciary and using powers to undermine the government, a charge that Gulen denies.  Davutoglu has said he will continue Erdogan's efforts to root out what the government calls a parallel state.
