Politico Founder to Be Washington Post Publisher Politico Founder to Be Washington Post Publisher 
 

Katharine Weymouth is stepping down as publisher of The Washington Post and will be replaced by Frederick Ryan, who previously led Politico.

Weymouth, a member of the Graham family that owned the Post for 80 years, announced Tuesday that she will leave the Post after serving for 17 years in various roles. She has been publisher for seven years.

The move follows the sale of the publication last year to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

On Tuesday, Bezos also announced the appointment of Ryan as the new publisher. Ryan had served as president and CEO of the political news outlet Politico, which he co-founded in 2007. In the 1980s, Ryan was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.

In a statement, Ryan called the Post a "crown jewel" of journalistic values.
