US Missionary Who Had Ebola to Discuss Recovery US Missionary Who Had Ebola to Discuss Recovery 
 

The doctor who oversaw treatment of two American missionaries who contracted the Ebola virus in west Africa says he doesn't know if a third sick American will be coming to his Atlanta hospital.

Dr. Bruce Ribner told NBC's "Today" show Wednesday that he doesn't know if the doctor now in isolation in Liberia will be sent to Emory University Hospital.

The North Carolina-based group Serving In Mission said Tuesday that the obstetrician has developed the Ebola virus. Ribner said Emory is prepared to handle any infectious disease.

One of his patients, Dr. Kent Brantly, said he knew the sick doctor quite well and has prayed for him and his family, whom he said were holding up "pretty well."

SIM was expected to discuss more about the doctor's condition later Wednesday.
