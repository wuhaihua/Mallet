Coast Guard Rescues 5 From Boat off San Diego Coast Guard Rescues 5 From Boat off San Diego 
 

Five people were rescued from a pleasure boat that took on water and lost power about 17 miles off the coast of San Diego.

The Coast Guard says the 30-foot vessel, the PMS Escape II, sent out a distress call Saturday evening.

The Coast Guard station in San Diego dispatched a helicopter, a cutter, and 45-foot response boat.

Another private boat, the Jawbreaker, had also heard the call and was assisting when the Coast Guard arrived.

Four adults and a 15-year-old boy were rescued. No injuries were reported.

The stricken boat was towed back to San Diego on Saturday.

The Coast Guard says it was determined that the flood was due to a faulty fitting in the engine.
