Earlier, Human Rights Watch said between 160 and 190 men were killed.Human Rights Watch says the new number is based on analysis of new satellite imagery, militant videos and a survivor's account.In June, the Islamic State group claimed it had "executed" about 1,700 soldiers and military personnel captured from Camp Speicher.Associated Press
