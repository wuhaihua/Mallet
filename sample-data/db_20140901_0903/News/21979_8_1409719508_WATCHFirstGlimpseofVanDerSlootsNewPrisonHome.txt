Joran van der Sloot is serving a 28-year sentence for the murder of a business student. He is also suspected of killing Alabama teen Holloway, who disappeared while on a graduation trip to Aruba. Van der Sloot has not been charged with Holloway's murder. Her body has never been found. The new footage shows van der Sloot at the Challapalca Maximum Security Prison, a 15,700-feet altitude facility where he was sent after allegedly threatening a guard for confiscating his cellphone. He is shown being escorted by prison guards, seached and having his blood pressure taken.In March, Peru announced that van der Sloot could be extradited to the U.S. for questioning in the Holloway case but not before he serves his sentence for strangling 21-year-old Peruvian Stephanie Flores. Van der Sloot, who married in July, last week went on hunger strike as he protested prison conditions.In-DepthVIDEO: Suspect in Natalee Holloway Case Threatened WardenJoran van der Sloot Won't Face U.S. Trial for 26 Years- Alexander Smith
