Americans Detained in North Korea Call for US Help Americans Detained in North Korea Call for US Help 
North Korea has given foreign media access to three detained Americans who said they have been able to contact their families and — watched by officials as they spoke — called for Washington to send a representative to negotiate for their freedom.

The three all described their situations as urgent.

American tourists Jeffrey Fowle and Mathew Miller, expected to face trial within a month for alleged anti-state crimes, said they do not know what punishment they could face or what the specific charges against them are. Kenneth Bae, a tour guide and missionary serving a 15-year sentence, said his health has deteriorated at the labor camp where he works eight hours a day.

They spoke with The Associated Press at a conference center in Pyongyang.
