911 Calls Show Efforts to Save Firearms Instructor 911 Calls Show Efforts to Save Firearms Instructor 
 

People at a northern Arizona gun range where a 9-year-old girl accidentally shot an instructor with an Uzi desperately tried to keep him alive as they urged 911 dispatchers to send a medical helicopter.

Recordings of emergency calls from the Aug. 25 death in White Hills were released Tuesday.

The callers said Charles Vacca was unconscious and convulsing.

A dispatcher urged callers to apply pressure to Vacca's wound while a man could be heard saying, "Breathe, come on, Charlie."

Vacca was flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later.

He was standing next to the girl from New Jersey when she squeezed the trigger and the recoil wrenched the Uzi upward toward his head.

Prosecutors aren't filing charges in the case.
