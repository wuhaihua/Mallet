"It was the most amazing experience, just to be able to share that experience," Kardashian later said of her nuptials. "We kind of wanted everyone to be on this love journey with us, because we fell in love in Paris, then I got pregnant with our daughter in Florence. So we kind of wanted to share our love story with all of our friends and family."
