A Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternity has been suspended by the university and the national organization after a woman fell from a third-story window during a party.

The woman was a college student but did not attend MIT.

The national office of Lambda Chi Alpha says the MIT chapter has been suspended, which means it cannot host and participate in activities until the investigation is complete.

The university and Boston Inspectional Services, which enforces building and safety regulations, are also investigating.

The woman was taken to the hospital after falling from the window at about 11:30 p.m. Sunday. She is expected to survive.
