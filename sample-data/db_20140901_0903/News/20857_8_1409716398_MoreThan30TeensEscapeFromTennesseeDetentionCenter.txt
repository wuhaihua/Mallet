Dozens of juveniles escaped a Tennessee detention center Monday, authorities said, with many of the teens still on the run.

The escape happened at about 11 p.m. at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center, said Rob Johnson, communications director for the Tennessee Department of Child Services.

The teens made their way into the yard area of the detention center that has an “anti-climb chain-linked fence,” Johnson said. But somehow, 32 of the juveniles were able to climb under the fence and escape.

The escaped teens range in age from 14 to 17 and have at least three felonies, Johnson said – from a history of running away to burglary and theft, violent crimes, drug-related crimes, foster care problems and mental health needs.

None of the escaped juveniles had been detained for homicide or murder.

Authorities are confident they will find the remaining escapees. The Metro Nashville Police, Tennessee Highway Patrol and Tennessee Children’s Services are helping to track down the escaped juveniles, Johnson said.
