Detroit-Area Man Faces Prison for Death on Porch Detroit-Area Man Faces Prison for Death on Porch 
 

A suburban Detroit man who shot an unarmed woman on his porch could come face-to-face with her parents as he receives his sentence for second-degree murder.

Theodore Wafer is scheduled to return to court Wednesday. Renisha McBride's family will have an opportunity to make a statement before the judge orders a punishment.

Prosecutors are recommending at least 17 years in prison for the Dearborn Heights man, including two years for unlawful use of a gun. Wafer says he shot the 19-year-old McBride because he feared for his life, but a jury rejected his claim of self-defense.

Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter is asking for as few as six years in prison. She says the shooting haunts Wafer.
