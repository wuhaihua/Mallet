Head of Niger's Parliament Flees to France Head of Niger's Parliament Flees to France 
The head of Niger's National Assembly, who faces questioning in connection with a baby trafficking scandal, is in France, a source close to the office of Burkina Faso's president said Sunday.

Hama Amadou fled to Burkina Faso last week as officials in his home country ruled his parliamentary immunity would not save him from being questioned over the scandal, which has rattled Niger's political class.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose Amadou's itinerary, said Amadou d was staying in Paris.

Amadou's wife and 17 other people including the country's agriculture minister have already been arrested over their suspected links to trafficking babies from neighboring Nigeria.

Amadou and his supporters say he is being targeted because he is a rival to Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou.
