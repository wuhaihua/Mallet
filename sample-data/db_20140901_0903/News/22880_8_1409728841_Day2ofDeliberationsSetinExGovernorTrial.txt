Day 2 of Deliberations Set in Ex-Governor Trial Day 2 of Deliberations Set in Ex-Governor Trial 
 

Jurors have their work cut out for them on day two of deliberations in the corruption trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen.

It's a process that requires them to review five weeks of testimony and scores of exhibits. Jurors worked at it for more than five hours Tuesday before quitting for the day. They return Wednesday morning.

The McDonnells are charged in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements.

McDonnell testified that he didn't do anything special for Williams in exchange for the gifts and loans.

Williams testified under immunity that he spent money on the McDonnells solely to get their help promoting Anatabloc.
