Armored Truck Overturns, Spilling Bags of Money Armored Truck Overturns, Spilling Bags of Money 
 

Police say an armored truck overturned on a Rhode Island highway, spilling bags of money that quickly drew passers-by.

Deputy Fire Chief Paul Valletta Jr. tells The Providence Journal (http://bit.ly/Y3w8qh) that the Garda truck was southbound on Route 10 on Saturday afternoon when the driver lost control. The truck swerved off the highway and onto the grass and rolled onto its left side.

Money stored in clear plastic bags and white canvas duffel bags flew out of the truck.

As state police watched, money was transferred to a second Garda truck that was called in.

Valletta says passers-by swarmed to the scene, but it wasn't clear if they took any money.

Both occupants of the truck had cuts and bruises and possible neck and back injuries.
