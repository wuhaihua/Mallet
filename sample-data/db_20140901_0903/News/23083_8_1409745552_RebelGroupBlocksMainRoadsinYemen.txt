Rebel Group Blocks Main Roads in Yemen Rebel Group Blocks Main Roads in Yemen 
Dozens of supporters of a Shiite rebel group demanding the reinstatement of fuel subsidies have blocked major roadways in Yemen's capital Sanaa in an escalation of its standoff with the government.

Supporters of the group, known as the Hawthis, on Wednesday brandished arms and batons while using tires and cement blocks to divert traffic from main roads, including a boulevard that leads to government buildings and state institutions. Tanks were positioned in front of the parliament and TV buildings.

The disruption of traffic comes a day after Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi dismissed the Cabinet and announced a reduction of fuel prices in an attempt to resolve the crisis.
