Sony is trying to woo Japanese game fans to the PlayStation 4 home console that went on sale in November in the U.S. and Europe, but didn't arrive at stores here until February.

Atsushi Morita, who heads Sony Computer Entertainment's Japan operations, acknowledged Monday the momentum for the PlayStation 4 in Japan wasn't catching up with the West, although its cumulative global sales reached 10 million recently, the fastest pace for any game console.

He told reporters new software games are in the works, mostly for early next year, including the "Dragon Quest" role-playing game, which is extremely popular with Japanese game fans.

A "metal slime" PS4 model, a tribute to one of the game's characters, will also go on sale.
