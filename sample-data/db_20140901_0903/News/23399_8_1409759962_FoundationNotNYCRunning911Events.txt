Foundation, Not NYC, Running 9/11 Events Foundation, Not NYC, Running 9/11 Events 
 

For the first time, the Sept. 11 foundation is in charge of New York City's annual 9/11 anniversary ceremony.

Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his top aides had been in charge of every aspect of the ceremony planning since the terrorist attacks. Bloomberg is the foundation's chairman.

Michael Frazier, a spokesman for National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation, tells the Wall Street Journal (         http://on.wsj.com/1r0skwE ) the transition began in 2012.

Marti Adams, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, says the mayor agreed to the decision to put the planning in the hands of the foundation.

She says the city is working closely with the foundation. Adams says it provides "citywide agency coordination to ensure the ceremony runs smoothly."
