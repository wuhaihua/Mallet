Going into his eighth season on "The Big Bang Theory," star         Jim Parsons says he never tires of playing lovable geek Sheldon Cooper.

"I never get bored playing Sheldon," he told the latest         Adweek. "You get used to it, and that's good, too. You should; it can help to deepen things, but it's so nice to have a reminder of the remarkable character you've been given a chance to inhabit."

Parsons knew he wanted to play Sheldon from the moment he read the pilot.

"I couldn't tell you a good, bad or ugly pilot just from reading it, but I can tell you a character I want to play. I did feel that with him from the beginning," he said. "God knows why. It probably does say something very odd about me, psychologically. That guy? Really? Yeah, yeah I did. I liked the way he talked, and I still do."

Parsons, who took a break from Sheldon to reprise his 2011 Broadway role in "The Normal Heart" for HBO's 2013 adaptation, recently returned to the CBS sitcom after prolonged salary negotiations resulted in a production delay.

The 41-year-old actor, along with fellow stars Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco, each inked three-year deals worth $1 million per episode, according to         The Hollywood Reporter.

"I'd certainly never done that before, and it's hard to imagine going through that again," Parsons told Adweek about the high-profile and drawn-out negotiation process. There's no joy in going, 'OK, we're not starting.' That was no fun. We enjoy doing this show. By the same token, I didn't have my head buried in the sand."

The salary bump couldn't be more timely. Parsons recently took home his fourth Emmy award for playing Sheldon.
