Australia Leader Talks up Uranium Trade With India Australia Leader Talks up Uranium Trade With India 
Australia's prime minister has talked up the prospect of Australia selling uranium to India for peaceful power generation ahead of his first trip to the nuclear-armed country as national leader.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office won't comment on media reports that he will sign a uranium trade deal with India while he visits Mumbai and New Delhi. He leaves Australia late Wednesday.

Abbott told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that since Australia had exported uranium to Russia, it "ought to be prepared to provide uranium to India under suitable safeguards."

A former Australian government struck a trade deal with Russia, but only a single shipment was made in 2012.

Greens party leader Christine Milne attacked Abbott for using the Russia trade deal as justification for similar uranium exports to India.
