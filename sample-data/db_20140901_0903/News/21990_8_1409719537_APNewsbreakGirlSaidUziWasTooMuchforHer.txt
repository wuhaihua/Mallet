APNewsbreak: Girl Said Uzi Was Too Much for Her APNewsbreak: Girl Said Uzi Was Too Much for Her 
 

Police reports released Tuesday say a 9-year-old girl who accidentally killed a shooting range instructor with an Uzi in northern Arizona had said immediately after the shooting that she felt the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder.

Her family members were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured by the gun's recoil and didn't immediately realize instructor Charles Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues ran over.

The reports say the family took a shuttle from Las Vegas about 60 miles south to the Last Stop range in White Hills, Arizona.

Vacca was standing next to the girl on Aug. 25 when she squeezed the trigger.

The recoil wrenched the Uzi upward and killed Vacca.

Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case.
