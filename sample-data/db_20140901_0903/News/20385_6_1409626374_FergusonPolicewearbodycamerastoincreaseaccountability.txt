Ferguson: Police wear body cameras to increase accountability Ferguson: Police wear body cameras to increase accountability 
					Washington: Police in the US town roiled by protests after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager are now wearing body cameras in a bid to calm local anger, a news report said.More than 1,000 protesters again marched on Saturday in the town of Ferguson, Missouri, over the August 9 killing of Michael Brown, 18, at the hands of a white police officer.Some in the St Louis suburb have also lashed out at the police response to the protests -- which turned violent on several occasions -- accusing authorities of unnecessarily heavy-handed tactics.Ferguson police began wearing the cameras on Saturday, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch, quoting the town's police chief Tom Jackson as saying the force -- which is overwhelmingly white -- was donated about 50 body cameras by two companies."We are still playing with them," Jackson reportedly said, adding that each officer will get one to use. "The quality is good," he said.Critics believe police will be more accountable if they wear cameras, which will also allow judges and juries to view for themselves police action in disputed incidents.A grand jury is hearing evidence to determine whether police officer Darren Wilson, 28, used excessive force in fatally shooting Brown, who was hit at least six times.AFP
