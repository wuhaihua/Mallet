Jury to Begin Deliberations in Ex-Governor Trial Jury to Begin Deliberations in Ex-Governor Trial 
 

A federal jury will hear instructions from a judge before beginning deliberations in the public corruption trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen.

U.S. District Judge James Spencer is to read his instructions to the seven-man, five-woman jury Tuesday morning. Prosecutors and defense attorneys wrapped up the five-week trial Friday.

The McDonnells are charged with doing special favors for Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for more than $165,000 in gifts and loans.

Bob McDonnell testified he did nothing other than extend routine political courtesies to Williams. Maureen McDonnell did not testify.

Williams testified under immunity that he spent freely on the McDonnells only to secure help promoting his company's chief product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc.
