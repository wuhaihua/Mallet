Northern Mexico State Approves Same-Sex Marriage Northern Mexico State Approves Same-Sex Marriage 
The northern state of Coahuila has become the second place in Mexico after the capital to recognize same-sex marriage.

State lawmaker Samuel Acevedo said Tuesday he presented the bill that was voted into law because he wants gay couples to have the same rights of straight couples.

The state of Coahuila on the border with Texas began allowing same-sex civil unions in 2007, but gay couples couldn't adopt children or get social security.

Acevedo said that the law approved on Monday will help "fight discrimination."

Currently, the only place in Mexico where same-sex marriage is legal is Mexico City, where a same-sex marriage law was enacted in 2010.
