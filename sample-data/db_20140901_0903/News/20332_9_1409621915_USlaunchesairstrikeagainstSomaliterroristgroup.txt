U.S. launches air strike against Somali terrorist group U.S. launches air strike against Somali terrorist group WASHINGTON - The U.S. military has conducted an air strike operation against Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda-linked militant group in Somalia, the Pentagon confirmed Monday, though further details were scarce."U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate," said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.The news comes a day after Al-Shabaab militants set off a car bomb at a prison and intelligence center in Mogadishu in an attempt to free inmates, then began a gunfight with military forces there. Somali officials said 12 people, including all of the attackers, were killed in the battle.Al-Shabaab militants were responsible for the attack at a Nairobi, Kenya shopping mall in 2013 that killed 68 people and injured 175. They are said to have staged lethal attacks across Somalia, including the capital of Mogadishu.Al-Shabaab has been designated as a foreign terrorist group by U.S. authorities since 2008. Last month, Somalia's president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told Reuters that his government had launched a military push called Operation Indian Ocean to flush Al-Shabaab out of the country after being significantly weakened in Mogadishu and other areas.
