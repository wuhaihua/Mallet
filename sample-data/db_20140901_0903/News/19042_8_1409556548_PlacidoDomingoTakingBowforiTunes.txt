Placido Domingo Taking Bow for iTunes Placido Domingo Taking Bow for iTunes 
Placido Domingo will be taking the final bow at this year's iTunes Festival.

The famed Spanish tenor will perform at London's Roundhouse on Tuesday, Sept. 30 â€” the last act of a month-long, starry line-up, festival organizers announced.

Deadmau5 kicks off the concerts on Monday night, followed by headline sets from pop names like Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry, Calvin Harris, The Script and Ed Sheeran.

Kylie Minogue, Kasabian, Mary J. Blige, Blondie, Maroon 5 and Robert Plant are also playing the festival.

The organizers quoted Domingo as saying he was thrilled to appear and for "the recognition that this brings to the unique and magnificent world of opera and of classical music."

Tickets are for competition winners, but gigs can be streamed live in over 100 countries or watched on-demand.
