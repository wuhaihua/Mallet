Officials also told Americans to stay away from the capital's government and diplomatic enclave known as the &quot;Red Zone,&quot; and avoid &quot;demonstration routes and areas, keep a low profile, exercise caution, and avoid large gatherings.&quot;Protests led by Imran Khan, a renowned cricketer before entering politics, and fiery cleric Tahir ul-Qadri, descended into deadly chaos on Saturday, with at least three people killed and more than 500 injured. On Monday, the State Department urged “all sides to refrain from violence, exercise restraint, and respect the rule of law,” adding that that the U.S. was not involved in the process or holding discussions between the parties.IN-DEPTHTV Screens Go Blank as Protesters Seize Network's HQPolice and Protesters Clash in Pakistan, Hundreds HurtProtesters Try to Blockade Pakistan's Parliament- F.
