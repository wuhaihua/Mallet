Muscular Dystrophy Telethon Raises $56.9 Million Muscular Dystrophy Telethon Raises $56.9 Million 
The Muscular Dystrophy Association's nationally broadcast annual telethon raised more than $56.9 million in contributions over the Labor Day weekend.

The two-hour "MDA Show of Strength" aired Sunday on ABC. The organization said Tuesday morning that it raised $56,952,177. That's less than the approximately $59 million that the telethon raised in 2013.

Celebrities, musicians and athletes appeared on the annual fundraising show to help raise money for the treatment of muscular dystrophy and related diseases.

Grammy-winner LeAnn Rimes, Rascal Flatts and hip-hop star Jason Derulo were part of this year's lineup, along with other entertainers.

The telethon was the fourth since comedian Jerry Lewis's 45-year role as host ended.
