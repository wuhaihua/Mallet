Dethroned Myanmar Beauty Queen Blasts Pageant Boss Dethroned Myanmar Beauty Queen Blasts Pageant Boss 
A dethroned beauty queen from Myanmar says she won't return her $100,000 crown until the pageant's organizers apologize for calling her a liar and a thief.

May Myat Noe — the 2014 Miss Asia Pacific World winner — insisted at a press conference Tuesday she had done nothing wrong.

She denied accepting breast implants, as claimed by David Kim, director of media for the South Korea-based pageant. He said the surgery was provided free of charge to help boost her into super-stardom.

Kim said the teen was stripped of her title because she was dishonest and unappreciative — and that she ran off with her bejeweled tiara.

Noe says that she boarded a plane for Myanmar without realizing she had been dethroned.
