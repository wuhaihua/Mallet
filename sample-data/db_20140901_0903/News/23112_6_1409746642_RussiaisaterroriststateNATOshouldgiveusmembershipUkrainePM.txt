Russia is a terrorist state, NATO should give us membership: Ukraine PM Russia is a terrorist state, NATO should give us membership: Ukraine PM 
					Kiev: Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk on Wednesday branded Russia a "terrorist state" that is solely to blame for the conflict in the east of his country and he reaffirmed Kiev's desire to join the NATO alliance.Using tough rhetoric on the eve of a NATO summit in Wales, Yatseniuk said: "Russia is a terrorist state, it is an aggressor state and will bear responsibility under international law.""Concerning NATO, I consider the most correct decision would be one to accept Ukraine as a member of NATO," he added, repeating a call he made last week.Yatseniuk also told a televised cabinet session that Ukraine had adopted a "wall" project aimed at building a "real state border" between Ukraine and Russia. He did not elaborate.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the long border between the two countries has been largely porous - a fact that Kiev says has helped fighters and weapons to pass freely from Russia onto its territory.Reuters
