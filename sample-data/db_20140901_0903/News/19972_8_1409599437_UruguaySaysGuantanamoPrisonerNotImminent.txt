Uruguay Says Guantanamo Prisoner Not Imminent Uruguay Says Guantanamo Prisoner Not Imminent 
The transfer of six men held at the Guantanamo Bay prison to Uruguay may not be imminent after all.

In July, the Pentagon gave Congress required 30-day notice that it intended to send six prisoners to the South American country. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica said he had agreed to take them as a humanitarian gesture.

But presidential spokesman Diego Canepa says the two governments are working out some undisclosed issues. He said Monday it would be hard to resolve them within the next two to three months.

He spoke after The New York Times reported Mujica asked the U.S. to postpone the transfer because it would be risky before Uruguay's Oct. 26 elections. Canepa says there never was a fixed date so reports of a postponement are incorrect.
