New York Man Gets Prison for Fatal Asphalt Toss New York Man Gets Prison for Fatal Asphalt Toss 
 

A New York man who threw a 10-pound chunk of asphalt through the windshield of a passing car, killing the driver, has been sentenced to two to six years in prison.

Alberto Plasencia (pluh-SEHN'-see-uh), of Yonkers, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in June. Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore says he was sentenced Tuesday.

Marie McSweeney was killed in April 2004 on the Sprain Brook Parkway in Yonkers. She was hit on the head when the asphalt was hurled from an overpass. Her car veered along the highway shoulder then crashed into the woods. Her 87-year-old mother survived.

The women had been heading to the Bronx to attend Mass.

Investigators reopened the case in 2009 after new information developed. The defendant was arrested by Yonkers cold case detectives.
