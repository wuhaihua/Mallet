Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) extremists on Tuesday released the video showing freelance reporter Steven Sotloff's beheading, two weeks after the emergence of a video showing the killing of journalist James Foley.Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for TIME and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished a year ago in Syria. Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with his captors for mercy, saying in a video that her son was &quot;an innocent journalist&quot; and &quot;an honorable man&quot; who &quot;has always tried to help the weak.&quot; Barak Barfi, a spokesman for the Sotloff family, said Tuesday they were grieving after having seen the video. The White House announced the verification on Wednesday. &quot;The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,&quot; National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin said.IN-DEPTHU.S. Will 'Degrade and Destroy' ISIS, Obama VowsWhat Do ISIS Extremists Really Want?Read Steven Sotloff's Best Writing for TIME- The Associated Press
