The flight ran into trouble two hours into its journey from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Orlando, Florida, according to a statement. After the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft &quot;began to depressurize...the pilots utilized their extensive training&quot; to land at Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport airport, in South Carolina. None of the 159 people aboard were hurt — but some passengers posted pictures of themselves wearing oxygen masks deployed overhead in the cabin.Allegiant said the flight was rescheduled for Monday. All passengers were provided with a hotel, refunded for that leg of the trip, and given a $200 voucher with the airline.SOCIAL— Alexander Smith
