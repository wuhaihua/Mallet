UN Provides Aid for Record 4.1 Million in Syria UN Provides Aid for Record 4.1 Million in Syria 
The World Food Program says it provided food to a record 4.1 million people inside Syria last month.

The U.N. agency says it was able to reach more people because of a Security Council resolution adopted in July that authorized the movement of humanitarian aid to Syrians in rebel-held areas without government approval. The aid is moved through crossings with Turkey, Jordan and Iraq.

Previously, the Syrian government had to approve all aid shipments.

The U.N. agency said in a statement on Tuesday that over the last six weeks, it has reached more than 580,000 people with deliveries that crossed across battle lines.

That number includes five cross-border convoys that delivered rice, lentils, oil, pasta and other staples for 69,500 in hard-to-reach zones in Aleppo, Idlib, Quneitra and Daraa provinces.
