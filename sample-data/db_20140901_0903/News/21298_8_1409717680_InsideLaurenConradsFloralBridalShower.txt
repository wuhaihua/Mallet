While a slew of celebrities tied the knot this weekend,         Lauren Conrad was getting ready for her big day with a floral-themed bridal shower.

Conrad's pal and editor of her website, Allison Norton,         posted a photo of the bride-to-be against a lovely floral backdrop.

"Best bridal shower for the best bride," she captioned the photo.

"The Hills" alum got engaged to University of Southern California law student William Tell back in October 2013.

Since then, she has been working hard on her nuptials, even designing the dresses her bridesmaids will wear.

Though         she previewed the dresses alongside five of her nine bridesmaids in the fall issue of Martha Stewart Weddings, she recently joked about recycling the bridesmaids' dresses her mother used for her wedding.
