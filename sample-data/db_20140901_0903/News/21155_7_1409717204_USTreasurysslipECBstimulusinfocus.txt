The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes—used to calculate mortgage rates and other consumer loans—rose to 2.3891. There are no major bond auctions slated for Tuesday.

Daiwa Capital Market economists said the manufacturing ISM would be in focus, "but in marked contrast to the weakness reported in the various manufacturing PMI surveys across Europe that month, the headline index is expected to be unchanged at a still-healthy 57."
