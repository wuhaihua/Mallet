Chicago Activist Back in Court in Immigration Case Chicago Activist Back in Court in Immigration Case 
 

A Chicago-area woman accused of covering up her conviction in a bombing in Israel when she entered the U.S. is returning to court for the first time since a new Detroit judge was assigned to her case.

Federal Judge Gershwin Drain is holding a status conference Tuesday. He got the case after Judge Paul Borman recused himself. Borman recently learned that his family had a stake in a Jerusalem market that was bombed in 1969.

Rasmieh Odeh is associate director at the Arab American Action Network in Chicago. She's charged with lying on immigration documents but wants the case dismissed.

Odeh, also known as Rasmea Yousef, was released from prison after 10 years in a swap between Israel and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
