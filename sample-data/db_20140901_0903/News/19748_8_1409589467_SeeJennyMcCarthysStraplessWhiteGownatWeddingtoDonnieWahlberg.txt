The "Blue Bloods" actor proposed to McCarthy this past April with a 10-carat yellow sapphire ring. Her son, Evan, helped his new step-father pop the question.

"Of course, I said, 'Yes,'" she said of the proposal a few days later on "The View."

This is the second marriage for both.

In another photo, McCarthy's dress can be seen clearly and she walks hand-in-hand with Wahlberg.
