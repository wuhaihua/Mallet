Greece Rules out New Cuts Ahead of Bailout Talks Greece Rules out New Cuts Ahead of Bailout Talks 
Greece's government says it won't enact further austerity measures ahead of talks later this week with bailout creditors.

Government spokeswoman Sofia Voultepsi said Monday that cuts in pay and income tax hikes would not be discussed at the three-day negotiations that are due to start in Paris on Tuesday.

Finance Minister Gikas Hardouvelis and four other cabinet ministers are to attend the talks with debt inspectors â€” the first time they have taken place outside Greece since the country was bailed out in 2010.

In return for money from its fellow partners that use the euro currency and the International Monetary Fund, Greece has had to enact a raft of austerity measures and reforms to its economy.

Greece's six-year recession is widely expected to come to end this year.
